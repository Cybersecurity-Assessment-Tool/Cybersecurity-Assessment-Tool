      "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
        "Summary": "Valier School District demonstrates a strong cybersecurity posture characterized by a proactive, policy-driven approach. The network environment utilizes professionally managed DNS via the University of Montana and leverages Google Workspace for secure email and web hosting. A key strength is the absence of externally exposed services on the primary firewall IP, combined with fully implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and regular security awareness training for all staff.",
        "Vulnerabilites Found": [
          {
            "Risk": "Potential DKIM Absence",
            "Overview": "While SPF and DMARC are robustly configured with a 'reject' policy, the explicit status of DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) was not verified in the current scan. DKIM provides a cryptographic signature to verify that email content has not been tampered with in transit.",
            "Severity": "Low",
            "Affected Elements": [
              "Email Sending Domains",
              "valier.k12.mt.us"
            ]
          },
          {
            "Risk": "Third-party Sender Exposure",
            "Overview": "The district includes third-party services like Infinite Campus within their SPF record. This expands the attack surface, as any security compromise at the third-party level could potentially allow unauthorized parties to send authenticated mail on the district's behalf.",
            "Severity": "Low",
            "Affected Elements": [
              "SPF Record: include:mg.infinitecampus.org"
            ]
          }
        ]
      },
      "Recommendations": {
        "1": "Verify and activate DKIM for all sending domains to complete the email authentication triad (SPF, DKIM, DMARC).",
        "2": "Perform regular internal and external vulnerability assessments of network devices to maintain the current 'zero-exposure' firewall status.",
        "3": "Develop, document, and conduct tabletop exercises for a formal Cybersecurity Incident Response and Disaster Recovery Plan.",
        "4": "Establish a live hardware and software asset inventory to detect unauthorized devices or applications immediately.",
        "5": "Conduct periodic security audits of third-party vendors (e.g., Infinite Campus) that have authorization to send mail on behalf of the district."
      },
      "Conclusion": "Valier School District maintains a solid cybersecurity foundation, effectively mitigating common risks through strong authentication, hardened network perimeters, and comprehensive policy frameworks. By addressing minor gaps in email signing and formalizing incident response protocols, the district will further solidify its resilience against evolving cyber threats."
