      "risk_name": "Critical Network Service Exposure",
      "overview": "The external IP address 104.28.1.189 has multiple high-risk services exposed directly to the public internet, including FTP (Port 21), SSH (Port 22), and RDP (Port 3389). This dramatically increases the attack surface, making the network vulnerable to brute-force attacks and service exploitation.",
      "severity_cvss_score": 9.3,

        "External IP: 104.28.1.189",

      ],
      "recommendations": {
        "easy_fix": "Immediately close all unnecessary ports on the external firewall. Services like RDP and SSH must be restricted to trusted IP addresses only.",
        "long_term_fix": "Implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution and require all remote access (RDP, SSH) to pass through the VPN. Replace FTP with a secure alternative like SFTP or FTPS."
