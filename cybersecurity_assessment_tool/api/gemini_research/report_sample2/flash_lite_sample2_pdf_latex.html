<p>Cybersecurity Readiness Report for G.A.S. Inc. Date: October 14, 2025</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Overview
This report assesses the cybersecurity readiness of G.A.S. Inc. based on provided DNS, port scanning, and security questionnaire data. The findings indicate several critical areas requiring immediate attention to improve the organization's overall security posture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Organizational Information</p>
</li>
<li>Organization Name: G.A.S. Inc.</li>
<li>Email Domain: gasinc.net</li>
<li>Website Domain: www.gasinc.net</li>
<li>External IP (Firewall): 104.28.1.189</li>

<p>Website Hosting IP: 104.28.1.189</p>

<p>Security Questionnaire Review
| Security Control                     | Status | Notes                                                                 |
| :----------------------------------- | :----- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| MFA for Email                        | ❌ No  | Critical vulnerability, leaving email accounts susceptible to compromise. |
| MFA for Computer Login               | ❌ No  | Significant risk for unauthorized access to internal systems.         |
| MFA for Sensitive Data Systems       | ✅ Yes | Positive step, but limited by lack of MFA on email and computers.     |
| Acceptable Use Policy                | ❌ No  | Lack of policy increases the risk of misuse and non-compliance.       |
| New Employee Security Training       | ❌ No  | New employees are onboarded without essential security awareness.     |
| Annual All-Employee Training         | ❌ No  | No regular reinforcement of security best practices for all staff.    |</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Summary: The organization demonstrates a significant lack of fundamental security practices, particularly concerning Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, and a complete absence of acceptable use policies and security awareness training. While MFA is implemented for sensitive data systems, the lack of it for email and general computer access creates broad vulnerabilities.</p>
<ol>
<li>DNS &amp; Email Security</li>
</ol>
<p>DNS Records
* The <code>gasinc.net</code> domain is configured with A records pointing to <code>104.28.1.189</code>.
* MX records indicate email is handled by <code>mailhostbox.com</code> services.
* An SPF record is present: <code>v=spf1 include:spf.mailhostbox.com ~all</code>. This is a positive step towards preventing email spoofing.</p>
<p>DMARC Record
* The <code>_dmarc.gasinc.net</code> DNS query returned <code>NXDOMAIN</code>. This means there is no DMARC record configured for the domain.
Conclusion: While basic SPF is in place, the absence of a DMARC record is a significant security gap. DMARC, in conjunction with SPF and DKIM, provides crucial protection against email phishing and spoofing. The lack of a DMARC record leaves the organization's email infrastructure vulnerable.</p>
<ol>
<li>Port Scanning Results</li>
</ol>
<p>Website Hosting (IP: 104.28.1.189)
* Port 80 (HTTP): Open
* Port 443 (HTTPS): Open
These are standard ports for a web server and are expected.</p>
<p>Firewall / External IP (104.28.1.189)
* Port 21 (FTP): Open
* Port 22 (SSH): Open
* Port 25 (SMTP): Open
* Port 80 (HTTP): Open
* Port 110 (POP3): Open
* Port 443 (HTTPS): Open
* Port 3389 (RDP): Open</p>
<p>Conclusion: The external IP address, which appears to be acting as both the firewall and hosting the website, exposes a broad range of services. This extensive open port list represents a significant attack surface. Specifically, open ports for FTP, SSH, SMTP, POP3, and RDP are highly concerning without strong authentication mechanisms like MFA, which are missing for email and computer logins.</p>

<li>Recommendations</li>
</ol>
<p>Given the critical vulnerabilities identified, the following recommendations are prioritized:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Implement MFA Immediately:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Mandate MFA for all email accounts (<code>gasinc.net</code>).</li>
<li>Enforce MFA for all computer logins (workstations and servers).</li>
<li>This is the most urgent step to mitigate widespread account compromise risks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Configure DMARC:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Create and publish a DMARC record for <code>gasinc.net</code>. Start with a <code>p=none</code> or <code>p=quarantine</code> policy to monitor and then move to <code>p=reject</code> once confident in SPF and DKIM configuration.</li>
<li>Ensure DKIM is also properly configured and aligned with SPF and DMARC.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minimize External Attack Surface:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Review all open ports on the external IP address (<code>104.28.1.189</code>).</li>
<li>Close any ports that are not absolutely necessary for external access (e.g., FTP, POP3, RDP, and potentially SSH if not managed securely with key-based authentication and rate limiting).</li>
<li>If RDP or SSH must be exposed, ensure they are secured with strong passwords, key-based authentication (for SSH), and ideally accessed only via a VPN with MFA.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Develop and Implement Security Policies:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Create a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy that clearly outlines security expectations and responsibilities.</li>
<li>Formalize and document a cybersecurity awareness training program for all employees.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Establish Security Training Programs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Implement mandatory security awareness training for all new employees during onboarding.</li>
<li>Conduct annual security awareness training for all existing employees, covering topics like phishing, password security, and safe internet practices.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consider Firewall Segmentation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If possible, segment the network to isolate the web server from internal resources, and ensure the firewall effectively blocks unsolicited incoming traffic.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>
G.A.S. Inc. currently exhibits significant cybersecurity readiness gaps, particularly in the areas of authentication, email protection, network exposure, and foundational security policies and training. The lack of MFA for email and computer logins, coupled with a broad range of open ports on the external perimeter and no DMARC record, exposes the organization to a high risk of compromise. Immediate implementation of the recommended actions, especially MFA and DMARC configuration, is crucial to establish a more secure operational environment.</p>

\subsection{Summary}
The organization demonstrates a significant lack of fundamental security practices, particularly concerning Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, and a complete absence of acceptable use policies and security awareness training. While MFA is implemented for sensitive data systems, the lack of it for email and general computer access creates broad vulnerabilities.

\section{DNS \&amp; Email Security}
\subsection{DNS Records}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \texttt{gasinc.net} domain is configured with A records pointing to \texttt{104.28.1.189}.
    \item MX records indicate email is handled by \texttt{mailhostbox.com} services.
    \item An SPF record is present: \texttt{v=spf1 include:spf.mailhostbox.com \(\sim\)all}. This is a positive step towards preventing email spoofing.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{DMARC Record}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \texttt{\_dmarc.gasinc.net} DNS query returned \texttt{NXDOMAIN}. This means there is no DMARC record configured for the domain.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Conclusion:} While basic SPF is in place, the absence of a DMARC record is a significant security gap. DMARC, in conjunction with SPF and DKIM, provides crucial protection against email phishing and spoofing. The lack of a DMARC record leaves the organization's email infrastructure vulnerable.
