<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report presents a cybersecurity assessment for
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, conducted by synthesizing data
from a network infrastructure scan, a security controls questionnaire,
and a review of pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The assessment identified a mixed security posture. On a positive
note, the external network scan of the target IP address revealed no
open ports, suggesting a well-configured perimeter firewall. This
indicates a strong defense against direct, unsolicited network intrusion
attempts on the scanned asset.</p>
<p>However, significant and critical gaps were identified in the
organization’s internal security controls. The two most pressing issues
are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
Email:</strong> This is a critical vulnerability. Email is a primary
vector for phishing, business email compromise (BEC), and account
takeover attacks. Without MFA, compromised credentials can lead directly
to a breach.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of Annual Security Awareness Training:</strong>
While new hires receive training, the lack of a mandatory annual
refresher for all employees creates a high-risk situation. The threat
landscape evolves continuously, and so must employee awareness of modern
phishing tactics and social engineering.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>While the technical perimeter appears secure at the point of testing,
the identified policy and procedural gaps expose <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong> to significant threats. Immediate remediation of these
control deficiencies is strongly recommended to mitigate the risk of a
security incident.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network vulnerability scan was performed to identify open
ports and exposed services.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Target:</strong> <code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> <strong>[Scan Date]</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Used:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="summary-of-findings">Summary of Findings</h2>
<p>The scan concluded successfully and found the target host to be
online. However, <strong>no open TCP ports were discovered</strong>. All
1000 of the most common ports scanned were reported as being in a
‘closed‘ state.</p>
<h2 id="interpretation">Interpretation</h2>
<p>A result of all ports being ‘closed‘ rather than ‘filtered‘ indicates
that the firewall is actively rejecting connection attempts, which is a
secure configuration. This finding suggests that the network perimeter
for this specific target is properly hardened against external
network-based attacks. No vulnerabilities were identified from this
scan.</p>
<h1 id="consolidated-risk-assessment">Consolidated Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes findings from the security control review,

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the consolidated risk assessment, the following actions are
recommended to improve the organization’s security posture.
Recommendations are prioritized by severity.</p>
<h2 id="r-01-remediate-lack-of-mfa-on-email-critical">R-01: Remediate
Lack of MFA on Email (Critical)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Action:</strong> Procure and implement an MFA
solution for the organization’s email platform (e.g., Microsoft 365,
Google Workspace).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Policy:</strong> Update IT and security policies to
mandate the use of MFA for all email access, including on mobile
devices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enforcement:</strong> Configure the email system to
enforce MFA enrollment for all users by a specific deadline. Disable
access for non-compliant accounts after the deadline until they
enroll.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="r-02-implement-annual-security-training-high">R-02: Implement
Annual Security Training (High)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Action:</strong> Select a security awareness
training platform or develop a curriculum that covers current threats,
including phishing, ransomware, social engineering, and password
hygiene.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Policy:</strong> Update the acceptable use or security
policy to require all employees, including executives and contractors,
to complete security awareness training annually.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Roll out the training program
and track completion. Consider periodic phishing simulations to
reinforce learning and measure effectiveness.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="general-recommendation">General Recommendation</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Continuous Monitoring:</strong> While the one-time scan
was clean, it represents only a snapshot in time. Implement a continuous
monitoring and vulnerability management program to regularly scan
external and internal assets for new weaknesses.</p></li>
