% --- Section 1: Executive Summary ---
\section{Overview and Executive Summary}
This report provides a comprehensive assessment of the cybersecurity posture for \textbf{[Organization Name]}, based on an analysis of network scan data, a security controls questionnaire, and a review of pre-existing risks.

The analysis revealed two critical areas of concern that significantly elevate the organization's risk profile. Firstly, a publicly accessible MySQL database (\texttt{5.7.33}) was identified on the external network at \texttt{[Target IP]}. This version of MySQL reached its End-of-Life (EOL) in October 2023 and no longer receives security updates, making it an easy target for known exploits. This finding directly corroborates the pre-existing "Database Exposure" risk.

Secondly, the security controls review identified a critical gap: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for accessing sensitive data systems. The combination of an exposed, unpatched database and the lack of mandatory MFA for sensitive systems creates a high-probability path for a data breach. An attacker who compromises a single set of credentials could gain direct access to potentially sensitive database information.

Immediate remediation is required to address these findings. Recommendations focus on isolating the exposed database, upgrading the EOL software, and implementing mandatory MFA across all sensitive systems.

% --- Section 2: Organizational Information ---
\section{Organizational Information}
The following details were used as the basis for this assessment.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Organization Name:} \textbf{[Organization Name]}
    \item \textbf{Primary Domain:} \texttt{[Domain]}
    \item \textbf{Target IP Address:} \texttt{[Client IP]}
\end{itemize}

% --- Section 3: Security Control Review ---
\section{Security Control Review}
A review of the organization's security controls was conducted via a questionnaire. The responses indicate a solid foundation in some areas, such as employee awareness and endpoint security. However, a critical gap was identified regarding access controls for sensitive data.

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\caption{Security Controls Questionnaire Results}
\begin{tabular}{p{0.6\linewidth} c l}
\toprule
\textbf{Control Question} & \textbf{Response} & \textbf{Assessment} \\
\midrule
Do you require MFA to access email? & \ding{51} & Best Practice Met \\
Do you require MFA to log into computers? & \ding{51} & Best Practice Met \\
\textbf{Do you require MFA to access sensitive data systems?} & \textbf{\color{criticalred}\ding{55}} & \textbf{\color{criticalred}Critical Gap} \\
Does your organization have an employee acceptable use policy? & \ding{51} & Best Practice Met \\
Does your organization do security awareness training for new employees? & \ding{51} & Best Practice Met \\
Does your organization do security awareness training for all employees at least once per year? & \ding{51} & Best Practice Met \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The absence of MFA for sensitive data systems is a significant weakness. MFA is a fundamental security control that mitigates the risk of unauthorized access resulting from compromised credentials.

% --- Section 4: Technical Scan Results ---
\section{Technical Scan Results}
An external network scan was performed to identify exposed services and potential vulnerabilities.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Target IP Scanned:} \texttt{[Target IP]}
    \item \textbf{Scan Status:} Host is Up
\end{itemize}

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\caption{Open Ports and Services Identified}
\begin{tabular}{l l l l}
\toprule
\textbf{Port} & \textbf{State} & \textbf{Service} & \textbf{Product \& Version} \\
\midrule
3306/tcp & Open & \texttt{mysql} & MySQL 5.7.33 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection*{Analysis of Findings}
The scan identified a MySQL database service running on port \texttt{3306} and accessible from the public internet. The running version, \textbf{MySQL 5.7.33}, is of particular concern as its official support and security patching ended in October 2023. Running End-of-Life (EOL) software, especially on an internet-facing system, exposes the organization to a wide range of publicly known vulnerabilities that will not be fixed by the vendor.

% --- Section 5: Consolidated Risk Assessment ---
\section{Consolidated Risk Assessment}
The following table synthesizes findings from the security control review, technical scan, and pre-existing risk data into a prioritized list of security risks.

\begin{tabular}{p{0.2\linewidth} p{0.5\linewidth} p{0.15\linewidth}}
\toprule
\textbf{Risk Name} & \textbf{Description} & \textbf{Severity} \\
\midrule
\textbf{Exposed End-of-Life Database} & A MySQL 5.7.33 database is publicly exposed on port 3306. This version is End-of-Life and no longer receives security updates. This aligns with the pre-existing "Database Exposure" risk (CVSS 7.5). & \colorbox{criticalred}{\color{white}\textbf{CRITICAL}} \\
\addlinespace
\textbf{Insufficient MFA for Sensitive Systems} & Multi-Factor Authentication is not enforced for access to sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access via stolen credentials, directly impacting the security of the exposed database. & \colorbox{highorange}{\color{white}\textbf{HIGH}} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

% --- Section 6: Recommendations ---
\section{Recommendations}
The following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified risks. Recommendations are prioritized based on severity and ease of implementation.

\subsection{Risk: Exposed End-of-Life Database (Critical)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Immediate (Containment):} Implement strict firewall rules to block all public access to TCP port \texttt{3306}. Access should be restricted to a minimal set of trusted IP addresses, if any are required.
    \item \textbf{Short-Term (Remediation):} Develop and execute a plan to upgrade the MySQL 5.7 instance to a currently supported version (e.g., MySQL 8.x). This will ensure the service receives critical security patches.
    \item \textbf{Long-Term (Architectural Fix):} Re-architect the application infrastructure to ensure the database is not publicly accessible. The database should reside in a private network segment, with access granted only through a secure bastion host or VPN.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Risk: Insufficient MFA for Sensitive Systems (High)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Immediate (Remediation):} Procure and deploy an MFA solution for all sensitive data systems, with the highest priority given to any system that provides access to the exposed database.
    \item \textbf{Short-Term (Policy):} Update the organization's access control policy to mandate the use of MFA for all employees and contractors accessing sensitive or critical company resources, regardless of location.
\end{itemize}
