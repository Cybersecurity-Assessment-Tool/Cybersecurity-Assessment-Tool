        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an active host with an open HTTP port (80). While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required for sensitive data systems, it is not enforced for email access or computer logins. Furthermore, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees, though new employees do receive initial training.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open Port 80 (HTTP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An Nmap scan identified an open port 80, indicating an active HTTP service. This port is commonly used for unencrypted web traffic. If not properly secured, this could expose the organization to various web-based attacks, including data interception, injection attacks, or server compromise. The lack of encryption (HTTPS) for web services on this port would also be a concern for data in transit.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Network host</li><li>Port 80</li><li>HTTP service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. If an attacker gains access to an employee's email, they could potentially pivot to other systems, impersonate the employee, or access sensitive information.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for logging into computers. This leaves computer systems vulnerable to unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or guessed. Compromised computer access can lead to data breaches, malware infections, and lateral movement within the network.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network access</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without a clear AUP, employees may be unaware of their responsibilities regarding company assets, data handling, and internet usage. This can lead to risky behaviors, data leakage, and increased exposure to cyber threats due to misuse or negligence.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Organizational policy</li><li>Employee conduct</li><li>Data security</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Regular Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct training for all employees at least once per year. This means existing employees may not be updated on the latest threats, best practices, or changes in company policy, leading to a degradation of security posture over time. Human error remains a leading cause of security incidents.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee knowledge</li><li>Organizational security culture</li><li>Incident prevention</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>It is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and computer logins to significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access. The service running on port 80 should be securely configured, encrypted using HTTPS, or disabled if not essential. The organization must develop and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy, clearly outlining expectations for secure behavior and data handling. Additionally, establishing a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees is crucial to ensure continuous education on evolving cyber threats and best practices. Regular review and updates of security policies and configurations are also advised.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization exhibits several critical security gaps, particularly concerning the lack of MFA for email and computer logins, and the absence of a comprehensive acceptable use policy and regular security awareness training. An open HTTP port also presents a potential entry point. While MFA for sensitive data and new employee training are positive steps, these are overshadowed by the broader vulnerabilities, indicating a moderate to high overall risk posture. Addressing these fundamental issues is crucial for improving the organization's cybersecurity readiness and reducing its susceptibility to common cyber threats.</p>
