        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The network assessment revealed an active host with an open port 8080, which was identified as hosting a 'TOP SECRET DB' service. From an organizational standpoint, the company has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access, an acceptable use policy, and conducts regular security awareness training for all employees. However, MFA is not currently required for computer logins or access to sensitive data systems.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2><p>No specific vulnerabilities were identified.</p><h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is highly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins. This will add an essential layer of security against unauthorized access to internal systems. Additionally, MFA should be extended to all sensitive data systems to protect critical information assets from potential compromise. Regular review of access controls and system configurations is also advised to maintain a strong security stance.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In conclusion, the cybersecurity assessment indicates a foundational level of security readiness, supported by existing acceptable use policies and consistent security awareness training. While no critical technical vulnerabilities were identified during the network scan, the current lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for computer logins and sensitive data systems represents a notable gap in access control. Addressing these MFA requirements is crucial for strengthening the organization's defenses and achieving a more robust security posture against evolving cyber threats.</p>
