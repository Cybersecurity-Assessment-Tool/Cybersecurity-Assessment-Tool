        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan data indicates that while hosts are up, no open ports were identified, suggesting a potentially minimal external attack surface or a highly restricted network configuration. However, the organizational data reveals significant internal security posture weaknesses. Specifically, there is a critical lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA) across key access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. While an acceptable use policy is in place and annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees, there is a notable gap in security awareness training for new employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require multi-factor authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing, potentially leading to business email compromise, data exfiltration, or further internal network penetration. This was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email accounts</li><li>Email servers</li><li>User credentials</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is not required for logging into computers within the organization. This exposes endpoints to elevated risks from compromised credentials, allowing attackers to gain unauthorized access to workstations, internal networks, and potentially sensitive data. This vulnerability was identified via the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations</li><li>Servers</li><li>User accounts</li><li>Internal network access</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This is a critical vulnerability as it means that a single compromised credential could grant an attacker direct access to highly confidential or proprietary information, leading to severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and significant reputational and financial damage. This was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>File shares</li><li>Cloud storage</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate New Employee Security Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. This leaves new hires vulnerable to common social engineering tactics, phishing attacks, and other security threats from the outset of their employment. Without initial training, new employees may unknowingly introduce risks to the organization's security posture, potentially leading to security incidents. This was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security culture</li><li>Overall security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, the immediate implementation of multi-factor authentication (MFA) is paramount. MFA should be enforced for all email access, computer logins, and, most critically, for all sensitive data systems. This will provide a crucial additional layer of security against credential theft and unauthorized access. Furthermore, a comprehensive security awareness training program specifically tailored for new employees should be established and made mandatory during their onboarding process. This will ensure that all personnel are equipped with foundational security knowledge from day one. While annual training is positive, integrating new employee training will close a significant knowledge gap. Regular reviews of network configurations and access controls are also recommended to ensure that the minimal external attack surface observed in the scan data is maintained and internal segmentation is robust.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to the widespread absence of multi-factor authentication across critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. This represents a critical vulnerability that could lead to severe data breaches and unauthorized system access. While the organization has an acceptable use policy and conducts annual security awareness training, the lack of initial security training for new employees is a notable gap. Addressing these MFA deficiencies and implementing robust new employee training are essential steps to improve the organization's overall security readiness and mitigate the identified high and critical risks.</p>
