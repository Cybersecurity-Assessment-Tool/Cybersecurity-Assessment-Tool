        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The network scan identified an FTP server running vsftpd 2.3.4 with anonymous login enabled. Organizational data indicates a critical lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, new employees do not receive security awareness training, though existing employees do receive annual training and an acceptable use policy is in place. Existing identified risks include workstations running outdated Windows 7 operating systems.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Anonymous FTP Access and Outdated FTP Server - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The FTP server running vsftpd 2.3.4 allows anonymous login. This configuration can lead to unauthorized access to files, potential data leakage, and even server compromise if write permissions are misconfigured. Additionally, vsftpd 2.3.4 is an old version with known vulnerabilities (e.g., CVE-2011-2523), making it susceptible to exploits.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>FTP Server (port 21)</li><li>vsftpd 2.3.4</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for accessing email, logging into computers, or accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access and account takeover if user credentials are stolen, phished, or otherwise compromised. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to critical systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email systems</li><li>User login systems</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees are not provided with security awareness training. This leaves them vulnerable to social engineering attacks, phishing attempts, and other common threats from the start of their employment, potentially introducing significant human-factor vulnerabilities into the organization's security posture.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Windows Operating Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Workstations are running Windows 7, an operating system that has reached its end-of-life and no longer receives security updates or patches from Microsoft. This exposes the organization to known and unpatched vulnerabilities, making these systems highly susceptible to malware, exploits, and advanced persistent threats.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations running Windows 7</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>It is strongly recommended to immediately disable anonymous FTP access and update the vsftpd server to a current, supported version, ensuring secure configuration practices are followed. Implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical systems, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data access, should be a top priority to significantly enhance access control. A mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees must be established and integrated into the onboarding process. Furthermore, all workstations running Windows 7 should be upgraded to a currently supported operating system (e.g., Windows 10 or 11) to ensure ongoing security updates and mitigate known vulnerabilities. Regular security audits, vulnerability scans, and penetration tests are also advised to maintain a robust security posture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several critical and high-severity security risks, primarily stemming from outdated software, a lack of fundamental access controls (MFA), and gaps in employee security training. While an acceptable use policy and annual security training for existing employees are positive steps, they are insufficient to address the identified vulnerabilities. Prompt and decisive action to implement the recommended mitigations is essential to significantly improve the organization's cybersecurity posture and reduce its susceptibility to cyberattacks.</p>
