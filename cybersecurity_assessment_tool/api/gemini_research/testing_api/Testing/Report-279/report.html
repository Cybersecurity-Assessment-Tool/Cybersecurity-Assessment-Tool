        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open MySQL port (3306) running version 5.7.33, indicating a potential database exposure. Internally, the organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and maintains a strong security awareness program with training for all employees, including new hires, and an acceptable use policy. However, MFA is not required for email access or sensitive data systems, presenting potential vulnerabilities in these areas.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network, exposing the database service. This allows external entities to potentially discover and attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in the MySQL server, leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, or service disruption. The vulnerability was identified through network scanning which detected the open port and the running MySQL service.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted IP addresses or internal networks. For a long-term solution, consider placing the database behind a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or within a segmented network zone to further limit exposure. Additionally, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) should be implemented for all email access and sensitive data systems to enhance account security and prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised. While the organization has a commendable security awareness training program and an acceptable use policy, reinforcing the importance of secure configurations and access controls, especially for database services, should be a continuous effort.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In conclusion, the organization demonstrates a proactive stance in employee security awareness and computer login security with MFA. However, critical vulnerabilities exist with an exposed MySQL database and the absence of MFA for email and sensitive data systems. Addressing these areas, particularly the database exposure and MFA gaps, is crucial to significantly enhance the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and readiness against potential threats.</p>
