            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network currently exposes Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) externally via port 3389. While the organization has an acceptable use policy and conducts annual security awareness training for all employees, there are critical gaps in its security posture. Specifically, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for email access or computer logins, and new employees do not receive initial security awareness training. These factors, combined with the exposed RDP service, indicate a significant attack surface and a lower state of readiness against common cyber threats.",

                        "Risk": "RDP Exposure",
                        "Overview": "Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed externally, allowing potential attackers to attempt brute-force attacks or exploit RDP vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access. This was identified through a network scan showing port 3389 open. Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to internal systems, data exfiltration, or further network compromise.",

                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Email Access",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks. If an attacker obtains an employee's email credentials, they could gain access to sensitive communications, launch further phishing attacks, or reset passwords for other services.",
                        "Severity": "High",

                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Computer Logins",
                        "Overview": "Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for logging into computers. This leaves computer access vulnerable to credential theft, brute-force attacks, and insider threats. A compromised login could grant an attacker direct access to an employee's workstation and potentially the internal network.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Workstations",

                    {
                        "Risk": "No Security Awareness Training for New Employees",
                        "Overview": "New employees do not receive security awareness training upon onboarding. This creates a critical gap where new staff may not be aware of the organization's security policies, common threats like phishing, or best practices for data handling. This oversight increases the risk of human error leading to security incidents.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "New employees",
                            "Organizational security culture"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately close port 3389 to external access. For necessary remote access, implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution with strong authentication, preferably Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), to secure RDP connections. Furthermore, implement MFA for all email access and computer logins across the organization to significantly reduce the risk of credential compromise. Establish mandatory security awareness training for all new employees during their onboarding process to ensure a baseline understanding of security best practices from day one. Regularly review and update the acceptable use policy to reflect current threats and technologies, ensuring it is communicated effectively to all staff.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces critical security vulnerabilities, primarily stemming from an exposed RDP service and a widespread lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for key access points such as email and computer logins. While some foundational security practices are in place, such as an acceptable use policy and annual security awareness training, the absence of initial security training for new employees and the critical RDP exposure significantly diminish the organization's overall security readiness. Addressing these vulnerabilities is paramount to preventing unauthorized access, potential data breaches, and maintaining a robust cybersecurity posture."
