        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan identified an open port 8080 exposing a service titled 'TOP SECRET DB', indicating a critical data exposure risk. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for email access, it is not required for computer logins or access to sensitive data systems. The organization maintains an employee acceptable use policy and conducts annual security awareness training for all employees, but new employees do not receive initial security awareness training.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unsecured Sensitive Database Exposure - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open port (8080) was identified during the network scan, exposing a service titled 'TOP SECRET DB'. This indicates a potentially highly sensitive database is accessible, possibly without adequate authentication or encryption, posing a severe risk of data breach and unauthorized access to critical information. The Nmap scan identified this service title, suggesting direct exposure.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li><li>TOP SECRET DB service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee workstations and internal network resources if primary credentials are compromised through phishing, keylogging, or brute-force attacks, as a single factor of authentication is insufficient to protect against modern threats.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Internal network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. Given the discovery of a 'TOP SECRET DB' service, this lack of an additional security layer makes these critical systems highly vulnerable to unauthorized access and data exfiltration if primary credentials are breached, as it removes a crucial barrier to entry for attackers.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>TOP SECRET DB service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Incomplete Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While the organization conducts annual security awareness training for all employees, new employees do not receive initial security awareness training as part of their onboarding. This leaves new hires vulnerable to social engineering attacks, phishing, and other common threats during their initial employment period, potentially introducing risks to the organization's security posture before they are adequately informed.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security culture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is critically important to immediately secure or remove the 'TOP SECRET DB' service exposed on port 8080, implementing robust authentication, access controls, and encryption for any sensitive databases. Furthermore, the organization should promptly implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to enhance workstation security and prevent unauthorized access. Mandating MFA for all sensitive data systems, especially for the 'TOP SECRET DB' and similar critical assets, is also crucial to protect against credential compromise. Finally, a comprehensive security awareness training program must be established for all new employees as part of their onboarding process to ensure they are aware of cybersecurity best practices from day one.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization faces significant cybersecurity risks, primarily due to the critical exposure of a 'TOP SECRET DB' service and the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for computer logins and sensitive data systems. While some foundational security practices are in place, such as an acceptable use policy and annual security awareness training, the lack of initial security awareness training for new employees also presents a notable vulnerability. Addressing these critical and high-severity risks is paramount to safeguarding sensitive data and maintaining overall organizational security readiness.</p>
