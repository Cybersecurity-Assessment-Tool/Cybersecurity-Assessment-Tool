        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network posture, based on the provided data, indicates a foundational level of security awareness and policy implementation, including an acceptable use policy and regular security awareness training for all employees. However, critical gaps exist in the implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for key access points, specifically email and sensitive data systems. While MFA is required for computer logins, its absence in other high-risk areas significantly elevates the organization's overall risk profile. No specific technical vulnerabilities were identified through network scans in the provided data.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Email accounts are frequently targeted by phishing and credential stuffing attacks. Without Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), a compromised password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's email, leading to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and further internal network penetration. This vulnerability was identified through the organization's self-reported policy indicating no MFA requirement for email access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee email accounts</li><li>Email server/platform</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Systems containing sensitive data (e.g., customer information, financial records, intellectual property) are high-value targets. The absence of MFA on these systems means that a single compromised credential could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and significant reputational damage. This vulnerability was identified through the organization's self-reported policy indicating no MFA requirement for sensitive data systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases storing sensitive information</li><li>Applications handling sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all employee email accounts and all systems that house or process sensitive data. This should be prioritized immediately to prevent unauthorized access stemming from compromised credentials. Furthermore, while security awareness training is in place, it should specifically emphasize the importance of MFA and how to identify and report phishing attempts targeting credentials. Regular reviews of access policies and system configurations should be conducted to ensure MFA is consistently applied across all critical assets.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a commendable commitment to security awareness training and acceptable use policies, which are strong foundational elements. However, the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for email and sensitive data systems represents critical vulnerabilities that significantly increase the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access. Addressing these MFA gaps is paramount to enhancing the organization's overall security posture and readiness against common cyber threats.</p>
