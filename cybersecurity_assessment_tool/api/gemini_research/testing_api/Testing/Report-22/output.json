            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization demonstrates a strong foundational security posture with multi-factor authentication (MFA) implemented for email access, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. An employee acceptable use policy is in place, and new employees receive security awareness training. However, a significant gap exists in the absence of annual security awareness training for all employees. No network-level vulnerabilities were identified through the provided scan data.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of Annual Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. This oversight leaves the workforce vulnerable to evolving cyber threats such as phishing, social engineering, and malware. Employees who are not regularly updated on current threats and best practices are more likely to fall victim to attacks, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, and financial loss. This vulnerability was identified through the provided organizational data.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "Organizational data",
                            "Network systems",
                            "Employee endpoints"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risk, it is strongly recommended that the organization implement mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees. This training should cover current threat landscapes, phishing recognition, secure browsing habits, data handling best practices, and incident reporting procedures. Regular training ensures that employees remain vigilant and are equipped to identify and respond to cyber threats effectively, thereby strengthening the organization's overall security posture.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization has established a commendable baseline with MFA across critical access points and initial security training for new hires. However, the absence of recurring annual security awareness training for the entire workforce represents a significant vulnerability. Addressing this procedural gap is crucial for maintaining a resilient defense against human-centric cyberattacks and enhancing the organization's overall readiness against evolving threats."
