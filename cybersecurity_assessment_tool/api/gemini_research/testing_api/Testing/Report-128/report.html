        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an active host with an open HTTP port (80), indicating an unencrypted web service. Organizational data indicates significant security gaps, including a complete lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. While an acceptable use policy is in place and new employees receive security awareness training, there is no annual security awareness training for all employees, leaving the organization vulnerable to evolving threats and human-factor risks.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems represents a critical vulnerability. A single compromised credential could grant an attacker full access to the organization's most valuable assets, leading to severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, financial losses, and significant reputational damage. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems (e.g., CRM, ERP, financial databases)</li><li>User accounts with access to sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Without Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email accounts, the organization is highly susceptible to credential stuffing, phishing, and brute-force attacks. A compromised email account can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, impersonation, and serve as a pivot point for further network penetration. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>All employee email accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to internal systems if user credentials are stolen, guessed, or phished. This vulnerability can facilitate lateral movement within the network, privilege escalation, and ultimately lead to data breaches or system compromise. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee workstations</li><li>Domain controllers (if applicable)</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive initial security awareness training, the lack of mandatory annual training for all employees means that ongoing threats, new attack vectors, and evolving best practices are not consistently reinforced. This significantly increases the likelihood of employees falling victim to phishing, social engineering, malware, and other human-factor attacks, thereby weakening the overall security posture. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open HTTP Port (Port 80) with Unencrypted Traffic - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open HTTP port (80) indicates that a web service is running without encryption. All traffic transmitted over this port is unencrypted and vulnerable to eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attacks, and potential data interception. If any sensitive information is exchanged or displayed via this service, it poses a significant risk of data exposure. This was identified via network scan data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Web server hosting content on port 80</li><li>Any applications or services served via HTTP</li><li>User data transmitted over HTTP</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediate implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is critical across all access points, starting with sensitive data systems, followed by email and computer logins, to significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access. All web services currently operating on HTTP (port 80) should be migrated to HTTPS (port 443) with proper SSL/TLS certificates to ensure encrypted communication and protect data in transit. Furthermore, a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees must be established and regularly updated to educate staff on current threats and best practices, reinforcing a strong security culture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to a complete absence of Multi-Factor Authentication across critical systems and an insufficient security awareness training program for its entire workforce. The presence of an unencrypted web service further exacerbates the risk of data interception. While an acceptable use policy is a positive step, these fundamental security gaps leave the organization highly vulnerable to various cyber threats, including data breaches, account compromises, and social engineering attacks. Urgent action is required to implement robust security controls and enhance employee awareness to improve the overall security posture and readiness.</p>
