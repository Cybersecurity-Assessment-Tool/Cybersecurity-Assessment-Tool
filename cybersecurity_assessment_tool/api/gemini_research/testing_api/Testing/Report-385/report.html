        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and computer logins, and by conducting regular security awareness training for all employees. However, the network scan identified an Nginx web server running version 1.18.0 on port 443. Critical gaps exist in the security posture, specifically the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems and a lack of an employee acceptable use policy.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA on Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical data if user credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or other means. A single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to sensitive information, leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and severe reputational damage. This vulnerability was identified through a review of organizational security policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without a clear policy, employees may be unaware of their responsibilities regarding the proper use of company IT resources, data handling, internet usage, and security protocols. This can lead to increased risks such as the introduction of malware, inappropriate data sharing, unauthorized software installations, and other behaviors that compromise the organization's security posture. This was identified through a review of organizational policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Organizational data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Web Server Software - <span class="severity-Low">Low</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nginx web server detected on port 443 is running version 1.18.0. While this is an older stable release, running outdated software increases the risk of unpatched security vulnerabilities being exploited. Although no specific critical vulnerability was immediately identified for this version, maintaining current software versions is a fundamental security best practice to ensure all known security patches are applied and to benefit from performance improvements and new features. This was identified during the network scan.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Web server on port 443</li><li>Nginx 1.18.0</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access. A comprehensive employee acceptable use policy should be developed, communicated, and enforced across all staff to establish clear guidelines for IT resource usage and data handling. Furthermore, all software, particularly critical components like web servers, should be regularly updated to their latest stable versions to ensure all security patches are applied and to reduce the attack surface. Regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing should also be conducted to proactively identify and address potential weaknesses.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has established a good baseline with MFA for email and computer logins, and consistent security awareness training, significant vulnerabilities remain. The absence of MFA for sensitive data systems and a formal acceptable use policy represents critical gaps that could lead to severe security incidents. Additionally, the use of outdated web server software introduces unnecessary risk. Addressing these issues is paramount to enhancing the overall cybersecurity readiness and protecting organizational assets.</p>
