        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open RDP port (3389), indicating potential exposure to remote access threats. Furthermore, an assessment of organizational policies identified critical gaps: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for accessing sensitive data systems, and there is no established employee acceptable use policy. While MFA is in place for email and computer logins, and security awareness training is conducted, these specific policy omissions significantly increase the attack surface and internal risk.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>RDP Exposure - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) port 3389 was found to be open and accessible. This exposes the system to potential brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, and other RDP-specific vulnerabilities, which could lead to unauthorized remote access and system compromise. This was identified via network scanning.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if credentials are compromised, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication. This was identified through the organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive Data Systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines on the appropriate use of company IT resources, employees may inadvertently or intentionally engage in activities that pose security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling company data. This was identified through the organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All Employees</li><li>IT Resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately close the exposed RDP port 3389 or restrict access to it via a Virtual Private Network (VPN) for authorized users only. Furthermore, implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to significantly enhance protection against credential compromise. Finally, develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to establish clear guidelines for IT resource usage and reduce internal security risks. Regular security awareness training should continue to reinforce these policies and best practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces critical and high-severity vulnerabilities primarily due to an exposed RDP service and a lack of MFA for sensitive data systems. The absence of an acceptable use policy further exacerbates internal risks. While the organization demonstrates readiness in other areas like MFA for email/computer logins and general security awareness training, these specific gaps require immediate attention to improve the overall security posture and protect critical assets.</p>
