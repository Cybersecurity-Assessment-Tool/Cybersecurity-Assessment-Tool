        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan indicates that no web server is openly accessible on port 80, as it is closed. The organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and computer logins, which is a strong security practice. However, MFA is not required for accessing sensitive data systems, which presents a significant vulnerability. The organization has an employee acceptable use policy and conducts security awareness training for new employees, but it does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees, indicating a potential gap in ongoing security education.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unencrypted Web Server - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Port 80 is open, which means any web traffic over this port would be unencrypted and vulnerable to eavesdropping. This could expose sensitive information if a web service were to run on this port without proper encryption. The vulnerability was identified through a network scan showing port 80 as open.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>It is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access, even if credentials are compromised. Furthermore, establish and enforce a policy for mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees to ensure ongoing education on current threats and best practices. For the identified 'Unencrypted Web Server' risk, ensure that port 80 remains closed if no web service is intended, or if a web service is necessary, configure it to redirect to HTTPS (port 443) with a valid SSL/TLS certificate to encrypt all web traffic. Regularly review and update security policies and conduct periodic vulnerability assessments.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational level of security readiness with MFA for email and computer logins, and initial security training. However, the lack of MFA for sensitive data systems and the absence of annual security awareness training for all employees represent critical gaps that could be exploited. Addressing these vulnerabilities and implementing the recommended security enhancements will significantly improve the organization's overall security posture and readiness against cyber threats.</p>
