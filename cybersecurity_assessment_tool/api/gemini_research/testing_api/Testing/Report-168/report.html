        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Based on the available organizational data, specific network scan details were unavailable. However, the organization's security posture indicates a reliance on basic security measures without comprehensive multi-factor authentication across all critical access points. There is also a notable absence of an acceptable use policy and a lack of consistent, annual security awareness training for all employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. A successful breach of an email account can lead to further internal network access, data exfiltration, and business email compromise (BEC) scams. This was identified from the organizational data indicating "Do you require MFA to access email?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email accounts</li><li>Email servers</li><li>User workstations/devices accessing email</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication is not required for logging into computers within the organization. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if user credentials are stolen or guessed. Without an additional factor of authentication, a compromised password grants full access to the local machine and potentially network resources, increasing the attack surface for lateral movement and data breaches. This was identified from the organizational data indicating "Do you require MFA to log into computers?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All organizational computers</li><li>User accounts</li><li>Network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy. Without an AUP, employees may not be fully aware of their responsibilities regarding the use of company IT resources, data handling, and internet usage. This can lead to increased risks such as data leakage, introduction of malware, non-compliance with regulations, and general misuse of company assets, as there are no clear guidelines or consequences for inappropriate behavior. This was identified from the organizational data indicating "Does your organization have an employee acceptable use policy?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Data assets</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Recurring Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This creates a gap where employees may forget best practices, become complacent, or not be updated on new and evolving threats (e.g., new phishing techniques, social engineering tactics). A lack of continuous training increases the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents, such as clicking malicious links, falling for social engineering, or mishandling sensitive information. This was identified from the organizational data indicating "Does your organization do security awareness training for all employees at least once per year?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network security</li><li>Incident response capabilities</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's cybersecurity posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, starting with email systems and computer logins. This will provide a crucial layer of defense against credential theft. Furthermore, the organization should develop and enforce a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) to clearly define employee responsibilities and acceptable conduct regarding IT resources. Finally, establishing a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees is essential to ensure continuous education on evolving threats and reinforce secure behaviors, thereby reducing the risk of human-factor incidents.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently exhibits several critical security gaps, primarily stemming from the lack of widespread Multi-Factor Authentication for email and computer access, the absence of a formal Acceptable Use Policy, and insufficient recurring security awareness training for its entire workforce. While MFA is utilized for sensitive data systems and new employees receive initial training, these isolated measures are not sufficient to protect against the broader threat landscape. Addressing these vulnerabilities is paramount to mitigating the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and human-induced security incidents, thereby improving the overall readiness against cyber threats.</p>
