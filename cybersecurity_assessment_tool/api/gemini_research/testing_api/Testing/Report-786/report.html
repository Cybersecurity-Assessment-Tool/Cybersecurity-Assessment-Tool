        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan indicates that port 80 is closed, suggesting no unencrypted web server is directly exposed. However, an assessment of organizational practices reveals several critical security gaps. The organization requires MFA for email and computer logins, which is a positive step. Conversely, there is a significant vulnerability in the lack of MFA for sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees, nor does it provide annual security awareness training for all employees, leaving the human element as a considerable risk vector.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if credentials are compromised, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient New Employee Security Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. This leaves new hires vulnerable to common social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) and unaware of organizational security policies and best practices, potentially introducing human error-based vulnerabilities from day one. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>Organizational data and systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Regular Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. This leads to a degradation of security knowledge over time, making employees more susceptible to evolving cyber threats and less likely to adhere to current security policies, increasing the overall risk of successful cyberattacks. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data and systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised. Additionally, a comprehensive security awareness training program should be established. This program must include mandatory training for all new employees upon onboarding to familiarize them with security policies and common threats. Furthermore, annual refresher training should be provided to all employees to ensure ongoing awareness of evolving cyber threats and best practices, reinforcing a strong security culture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the network scan shows no immediate external web server vulnerabilities, the organization's current security posture is significantly weakened by internal policy and training deficiencies. The absence of MFA for sensitive data systems and the complete lack of security awareness training for both new and existing employees represent high-priority risks that could lead to data breaches, compliance failures, and operational disruptions. Addressing these human and access control vulnerabilities is paramount to enhancing the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness.</p>
