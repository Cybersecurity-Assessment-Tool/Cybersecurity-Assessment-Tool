        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and conducting regular security awareness training for all employees, including new hires. However, critical gaps exist in the broader application of MFA and the establishment of essential security policies, indicating a need for enhanced controls to protect internal systems and data.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for employees to log into their computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to internal systems and data if credentials are compromised through phishing, keylogging, or brute-force attacks. Without MFA, a single stolen password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's workstation and potentially the internal network. This vulnerability was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Internal network access</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not enforced for accessing sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk, as compromised credentials could allow unauthorized individuals to access, modify, or exfiltrate sensitive organizational data without an additional layer of security. The impact could range from data breaches and regulatory non-compliance to significant financial and reputational damage. This vulnerability was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases containing confidential information</li><li>Cloud storage for sensitive files</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without a clear policy, employees may be unaware of their responsibilities regarding the use of company IT resources, internet access, and data handling. This can lead to misuse of company assets, increased exposure to malware, data leakage, and potential legal or compliance issues. The absence of such a policy makes it difficult to enforce security best practices and hold employees accountable for their actions. This vulnerability was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee-facing IT systems</li><li>Network resources</li><li>Company data</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and, critically, for access to all sensitive data systems. This will provide a vital additional layer of security against credential theft. Furthermore, the organization must develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy. This policy should clearly outline expectations for IT resource usage, data handling, and internet browsing, ensuring all employees understand their roles in maintaining a secure environment. Regular reviews and updates of this policy, alongside continued security awareness training, will foster a stronger security culture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has established a baseline for security with MFA for email and consistent security awareness training, significant vulnerabilities remain due to the absence of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, as well as the lack of an employee acceptable use policy. Addressing these critical gaps is paramount to mitigating the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and operational disruptions, thereby improving the overall readiness against cyber threats.</p>
