        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a mixed security posture. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for email and sensitive data systems, and annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees, significant vulnerabilities exist. Specifically, there is a lack of MFA for computer logins and no dedicated security awareness training for new employees. Furthermore, a network scan identified an open port 80, indicating a potentially exposed web service that requires further investigation and securing.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unsecured Web Service / Open Port 80 - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A network scan revealed an open port 80 (HTTP) on a host within the organization's network. This indicates a web service is running without encryption, which can expose sensitive data in transit and make the service vulnerable to various web-based attacks if not properly secured, patched, and configured. The absence of HTTPS by default is a concern.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with open port 80</li><li>Potentially web applications and data transmitted over HTTP</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for employee computer logins. This critical security gap means that if an attacker obtains an employee's password, they can gain unauthorized access to the computer and potentially the internal network without an additional layer of verification, significantly increasing the risk of credential theft and lateral movement.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers</li><li>User accounts</li><li>Internal network resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Security Awareness Training for New Hires - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees are not provided with security awareness training upon joining the organization. This leaves them susceptible to social engineering tactics such as phishing, malware, and other human-centric attacks from the outset. Without foundational knowledge of security policies and best practices, new hires pose an elevated risk of inadvertently compromising organizational security.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network integrity</li><li>Overall security culture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To enhance the organization's security posture, several key recommendations are provided. Firstly, it is crucial to investigate the service running on the identified open port 80. If it's a web server, ensure it is properly secured, regularly patched, and configured to enforce HTTPS for all communications to protect data in transit. Secondly, implement mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all employee computer logins to significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access from compromised credentials. Lastly, establish a comprehensive and mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees as part of their onboarding process to equip them with essential security knowledge and best practices from day one.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The current cybersecurity assessment reveals that while the organization has implemented some essential security controls like MFA for sensitive systems and annual security training, critical vulnerabilities persist. The absence of MFA for computer logins and initial security training for new employees, coupled with an exposed web service on port 80, indicates a need for immediate attention to strengthen foundational security measures. Addressing these gaps will significantly improve the organization's overall readiness against common cyber threats and reduce its attack surface.</p>
