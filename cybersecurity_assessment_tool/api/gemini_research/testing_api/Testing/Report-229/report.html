        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The network scan identified an open port 443 running Nginx 1.18.0, an outdated web server. Organizational data reveals critical gaps in security practices, including the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, a lack of an employee acceptable use policy, and insufficient annual security awareness training for all employees. While MFA is used for sensitive data systems and new employees receive initial security training, these isolated measures do not compensate for the broader vulnerabilities.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Web Server Software - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nginx web server running on port 443 is version 1.18.0, which is an End-of-Life (EOL) version. EOL software no longer receives security updates, making it vulnerable to known and newly discovered exploits. This could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or denial of service.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Nginx 1.18.0 on port 443</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for email access. Email accounts are frequent targets for phishing and credential stuffing attacks. Without MFA, a compromised password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's email, potentially leading to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, or further network penetration.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email access systems</li><li>Employee email accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for computer logins. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to internal systems if an employee's login credentials are stolen or guessed. Attackers could gain access to workstations, internal networks, and sensitive data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network login systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. An AUP defines the proper use of company resources, including IT systems, internet, and email. Without clear guidelines, employees may unknowingly engage in risky behaviors (e.g., installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, sharing sensitive information inappropriately), increasing the likelihood of security incidents.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual training for all employees. Cybersecurity threats evolve rapidly, and without regular updates, employees may not be aware of the latest phishing techniques, social engineering tactics, or internal security protocols. This increases the risk of human error leading to security breaches.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Prioritize updating the Nginx web server to a currently supported and patched version to mitigate known vulnerabilities. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all email accounts and for all computer logins to significantly enhance credential security. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to guide appropriate behavior and reduce insider risks. Furthermore, establish a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees to ensure they are continuously informed about evolving cyber threats and best practices. Regularly review and update security policies and configurations.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to outdated software and critical deficiencies in its security policies and employee training programs. The lack of MFA for email and computer logins, coupled with an absent acceptable use policy and infrequent security awareness training, creates a substantial attack surface. While some positive security measures are in place, the overall readiness is compromised by these fundamental gaps, requiring immediate and comprehensive remediation to improve the organization's defensive posture against prevalent cyber threats.</p>
