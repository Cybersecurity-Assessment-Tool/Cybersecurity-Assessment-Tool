        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed a host with an open FTP port running vsftpd version 2.3.4, which allows anonymous login. This version is significantly outdated and poses a high risk. Internally, the organization utilizes MFA for email and computer logins but critically lacks it for sensitive data systems. While an acceptable use policy is in place, there is a complete absence of security awareness training for both new and existing employees. Furthermore, several workstations are identified as running Windows 7, an end-of-life operating system.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Anonymous FTP Access & Outdated FTP Server - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The FTP server is running vsftpd 2.3.4, a version released in 2011, which is highly susceptible to known vulnerabilities. Critically, the server is configured to allow anonymous FTP login, meaning unauthorized users can access and potentially modify files without authentication. This poses a severe risk of data breach, data integrity compromise, and potential server exploitation.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>FTP server (port 21)</li><li>vsftpd 2.3.4</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Windows Policy - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Several computers within the organization are running Windows 7. This operating system reached its end-of-life in January 2020 and no longer receives security updates from Microsoft. Continuing to use Windows 7 leaves these workstations highly vulnerable to known and newly discovered exploits, significantly increasing the risk of malware infection, data compromise, and network penetration.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations running Windows 7</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for email and computer logins, it is not required for accessing sensitive data systems. This leaves critical organizational data vulnerable to unauthorized access if a single factor (e.g., a password) is compromised through phishing, credential stuffing, or other attack vectors. The absence of MFA on these systems significantly elevates the risk of a data breach.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees, nor does it provide annual training for all employees. This critical gap leaves the workforce susceptible to social engineering attacks, such as phishing, pretexting, and malware delivery. Employees who are not regularly trained on cybersecurity best practices are more likely to make mistakes that could lead to security incidents, data loss, or system compromise.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, immediate action is required. Firstly, disable anonymous FTP access on the vsftpd 2.3.4 server and consider upgrading or replacing the outdated FTP solution with a secure alternative like SFTP or FTPS, ensuring strong authentication and encryption. Secondly, all workstations running Windows 7 must be upgraded to a currently supported operating system (e.g., Windows 10 or 11) to receive critical security updates. Thirdly, implement mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to add a crucial layer of protection against credential compromise. Finally, establish and enforce a comprehensive security awareness training program, including mandatory training for all new hires and annual refreshers for all employees, to educate the workforce on cybersecurity best practices and threat identification.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces a significant array of cybersecurity vulnerabilities, ranging from critical infrastructure misconfigurations and outdated software to fundamental gaps in security policies and employee training. The presence of an anonymous FTP server, end-of-life operating systems, and the lack of MFA for sensitive data systems represent immediate and high-impact threats. The absence of regular security awareness training further exacerbates these risks by leaving the human element vulnerable to exploitation. Addressing these identified weaknesses is paramount to enhancing the organization's overall security posture and resilience against cyber threats.</p>
