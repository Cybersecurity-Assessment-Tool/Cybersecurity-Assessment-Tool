        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>A detailed network summary could not be generated due to broken network scan data. However, an assessment of organizational policies indicates significant gaps in foundational security controls, particularly concerning multi-factor authentication and employee security awareness. The organization currently lacks robust defenses against common attack vectors that exploit human factors and credential compromise.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive communications and potential phishing attacks, as compromised credentials (e.g., via phishing or brute-force) would grant full access without a second factor. This was identified through organizational policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email systems</li><li>User accounts</li><li>Organizational data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This poses a critical risk, as compromised user credentials could allow attackers direct access to internal workstations and network resources, potentially leading to data breaches, malware propagation, or lateral movement within the network. This was identified through organizational policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations</li><li>Network access points</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines on appropriate use of company IT resources, employees may engage in activities that introduce security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive data. This increases the likelihood of malware infections, data loss, and compliance issues. This was identified through organizational policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Comprehensive Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees, nor does it provide annual training for all employees. This leaves the workforce vulnerable to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting), malware, and other human-factor exploits. A lack of awareness can lead to poor security practices, increasing the overall attack surface and risk of successful breaches. This was identified through organizational policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>IT systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and computer logins. This critical step will significantly enhance protection against credential theft. Furthermore, the organization must develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to establish clear guidelines for IT resource usage. Concurrently, a robust security awareness training program should be established, including mandatory training for all new hires and annual refresher training for all employees, to educate staff on cybersecurity best practices and threat recognition.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to a lack of foundational security policies and controls, particularly concerning multi-factor authentication and employee security awareness. While specific technical vulnerabilities could not be fully assessed due to incomplete scan data, the identified policy gaps indicate a low readiness level against common and impactful attack vectors. Addressing these human-factor and access control vulnerabilities is paramount to improving the organization's overall security posture and reducing its susceptibility to breaches.</p>
