        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The network scan indicated no immediately discoverable open ports, suggesting a basic level of network perimeter hygiene. However, a review of organizational security policies and practices reveals significant internal vulnerabilities. The organization currently lacks critical multi-factor authentication (MFA) controls across email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, there is a notable absence of comprehensive security awareness training for both new and existing employees, which significantly elevates the risk of human-factor related security incidents.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce MFA for accessing employee email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to email, even if an attacker obtains credentials through phishing or other means. Compromised email accounts can lead to further attacks, data exfiltration, and business email compromise (BEC) scams.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee email accounts</li><li>Email server/service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for logging into computers. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or guessed, potentially allowing attackers to gain a foothold in the internal network and access sensitive systems or data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All organizational computers</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce MFA for accessing sensitive data systems. This is a critical vulnerability as it means that a single compromised credential could grant an attacker direct access to the most valuable assets, leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and severe reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>Applications storing sensitive information</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees are not provided with security awareness training. This means they may not be aware of common cyber threats (e.g., phishing, social engineering) or organizational security policies, making them more susceptible to falling victim to attacks and inadvertently introducing risks to the organization.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. Regular training is crucial to keep employees updated on evolving threats and reinforce best practices. Without it, employees' security knowledge can degrade over time, increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, immediate implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is strongly recommended for all access points, including email, computer logins, and especially sensitive data systems. This will provide a crucial layer of defense against credential theft. Concurrently, a robust security awareness training program must be established. This program should include mandatory training for all new employees upon onboarding and annual refresher training for all staff to ensure continuous education on evolving cyber threats and best security practices. Regular policy reviews and enforcement are also advised to maintain a strong security culture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the external network scan did not reveal immediate technical vulnerabilities, the organization's readiness is significantly hampered by critical gaps in its security policies and employee training. The absence of MFA across key systems and the lack of consistent security awareness training expose the organization to a high risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and successful social engineering attacks. Addressing these fundamental policy and training deficiencies is paramount to improving the overall cybersecurity posture and protecting organizational assets.</p>
