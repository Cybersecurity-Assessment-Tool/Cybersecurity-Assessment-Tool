        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan indicates that port 80 is currently closed. The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to security awareness, providing training for new employees and annually for all staff, and has an acceptable use policy in place. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is required for logging into computers and accessing sensitive data systems. However, a significant gap exists as MFA is not required for email access.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unencrypted Web Server - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This risk indicates that a web server is potentially running without encryption, exposing data transmitted over HTTP. The vulnerability was identified because Port 80 was found to be open, suggesting unencrypted web traffic. The impact could be the interception and exposure of sensitive information during transit.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all email access to enhance account security. Regarding the potential unencrypted web server, ensure that port 80 is indeed closed if it's not intended for use, or if a web server is active, configure it to redirect all traffic to HTTPS, enforcing SSL/TLS encryption. This involves obtaining and installing a valid SSL certificate and configuring the web server to use it, thereby protecting data in transit.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Overall, the organization has a foundational security posture with good practices in employee training and acceptable use policies, along with MFA for critical internal systems. However, the lack of MFA for email access presents a notable vulnerability, and the reported unencrypted web server, despite the current scan showing port 80 as closed, highlights a potential area for misconfiguration or past exposure that warrants verification and remediation to ensure all web traffic is securely encrypted.</p>
