        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization operates a web server running Nginx version 1.18.0, accessible via HTTPS on port 443. While some security measures are in place, such as an employee acceptable use policy and annual security awareness training for all employees, significant gaps exist in critical areas. Specifically, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for email access or computer logins, although it is mandated for sensitive data systems. New employees also do not receive initial security awareness training.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Web Server Software - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nginx web server is running version 1.18.0. This version is older and may contain known vulnerabilities that have been addressed in more recent releases. Running outdated software increases the risk of exploitation by attackers who can leverage these known weaknesses to gain unauthorized access, compromise data, or disrupt services. This vulnerability was identified through network scanning.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Web server (Nginx 1.18.0)</li><li>Port 443</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for accessing employee email accounts. Email is a primary target for phishing and credential stuffing attacks. Without MFA, a compromised password alone grants an attacker full access to an employee's email, potentially leading to Business Email Compromise (BEC), sensitive data exfiltration, or further internal network penetration. This was identified from organizational security policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee email accounts</li><li>Email system</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for employees to log into their computers. If an attacker obtains an employee's login credentials, they can gain direct access to the workstation and potentially the internal network without any additional authentication challenge. This significantly elevates the risk of unauthorized access, malware deployment, and lateral movement within the organization's network. This was identified from organizational security policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training upon joining the organization. This leaves new hires vulnerable to social engineering attacks, phishing attempts, and other common threats due to a lack of understanding of organizational security policies, best practices, and common attack vectors. New employees are often targeted by adversaries due to their unfamiliarity with the company's security culture and procedures. This was identified from organizational security policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to update the Nginx web server to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities and improve overall security. Implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and computer logins is critical to significantly enhance identity and access management, protecting against credential theft and unauthorized access. Furthermore, a mandatory security awareness training program should be established for all new employees as part of their onboarding process to ensure they are equipped with essential cybersecurity knowledge from day one. The existing annual security awareness training for all employees should continue to reinforce best practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a moderate level of cybersecurity readiness, with some foundational policies and training in place. However, critical vulnerabilities exist, particularly concerning the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for email and computer logins, which represents a significant risk to identity and access management. The use of an outdated web server and the absence of initial security awareness training for new hires also present exploitable weaknesses. Addressing these high and medium severity risks through software updates, comprehensive MFA implementation, and enhanced employee training is crucial for improving the organization's overall security posture and reducing its susceptibility to common cyber threats.</p>
