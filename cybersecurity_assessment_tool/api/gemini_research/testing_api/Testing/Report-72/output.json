            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to identity and access management by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. However, a comprehensive assessment of the network infrastructure and specific system vulnerabilities could not be performed due to broken network scan data. Based on available organizational data, there are significant gaps in human-element security, specifically regarding employee policies and security awareness training.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy",
                        "Overview": "The organization currently lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines, employees may be unaware of appropriate conduct regarding company resources, data handling, internet usage, and device security. This absence increases the risk of misuse of company assets, exposure to malware, data leakage, and potential legal or compliance issues due to unauthorized activities. The risk was identified through organizational data indicating no such policy is in place.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",

                            "sensitive data",

                    {
                        "Risk": "No Security Awareness Training for New Employees",
                        "Overview": "New employees are not provided with security awareness training upon joining the organization. This leaves new hires vulnerable to common cyber threats such as phishing, social engineering, and malware, as they may not be equipped with the knowledge to identify and mitigate these risks. This significantly increases the organization's attack surface from day one of employment, potentially leading to initial compromises. The risk was identified through organizational data indicating no training for new employees.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "New employees",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of Annual Security Awareness Training for All Employees",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. Regular training is crucial to keep employees updated on evolving threats, reinforce security best practices, and maintain a strong security posture. Without it, employees may become complacent, forget critical security protocols, or be unaware of new attack vectors, making them more susceptible to sophisticated cyberattacks over time. This ongoing lack of education poses a continuous high risk to the organization's security. The risk was identified through organizational data indicating no annual training.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "company systems",
                            "sensitive data",
                            "overall organizational security posture"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified human-element security risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately develop and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy, clearly outlining expectations for resource usage and data handling. Furthermore, a mandatory security awareness training program should be established for all new employees as part of their onboarding process. This training should be reinforced with annual refresher courses for all existing employees to ensure continuous education on evolving cyber threats and best practices. While MFA implementation is commendable, addressing these policy and training gaps is crucial for a holistic security strategy.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization has a commendable foundation in identity and access management with robust Multi-Factor Authentication across critical systems. However, the absence of an employee acceptable use policy and a complete lack of security awareness training for both new and existing employees represent significant and critical vulnerabilities. These gaps expose the organization to a high risk of human-error induced security incidents, social engineering attacks, and potential data breaches. Addressing these policy and training deficiencies is paramount to improving the overall cybersecurity readiness and reducing the attack surface."
