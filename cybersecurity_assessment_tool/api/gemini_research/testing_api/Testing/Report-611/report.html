        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to security awareness training, conducting it for new employees and annually for all staff, and has an acceptable use policy in place. However, significant vulnerabilities exist concerning access controls and network configuration. Specifically, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for email access or sensitive data systems, leaving these critical areas susceptible to credential-based attacks. Network scanning identified an active host with an open SSH port (22), and a critical 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability, indicating potential misconfigurations that could allow external access to internal services.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A critical vulnerability was identified where a service intended for local access (localhost) appears to be exposed and accessible from external network interfaces. This could allow unauthorized external entities to interact with internal services, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or privilege escalation. The high severity indicates a direct and easily exploitable path for attackers. This was identified via network scanning activities.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Affected IP address/interface</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee inboxes if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or other means. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to sensitive communications and potentially facilitate further attacks within the organization. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not mandated for logging into systems containing sensitive data. This poses a high risk, as compromised credentials could grant attackers direct access to confidential information, intellectual property, or critical operational data. The absence of this additional layer of security makes these systems prime targets for data exfiltration and sabotage. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately review and rectify the 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability by ensuring all services are correctly bound to their intended interfaces and that network and firewall rules strictly prevent external access to internal-only services. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts to protect against credential compromise. Furthermore, extend MFA requirements to all systems that house or process sensitive data to establish a critical layer of defense against unauthorized access. Regular network configuration audits and penetration testing should be conducted to proactively identify and address similar vulnerabilities.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has a commendable foundation in security awareness training and acceptable use policies, its overall cybersecurity readiness is significantly hampered by critical technical vulnerabilities and gaps in access control policies. The 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability presents an immediate and severe threat, and the absence of MFA for email and sensitive data systems leaves key assets highly exposed. Addressing these critical areas is paramount to enhancing the organization's security posture and protecting against potential breaches.</p>
