        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing an acceptable use policy and providing initial security awareness training for new employees. However, critical gaps exist in the application of multi-factor authentication (MFA) across key access points and in the consistency of ongoing security awareness training for the entire workforce. The lack of comprehensive MFA significantly elevates the risk of unauthorized access through compromised credentials, while infrequent training leaves the human element vulnerable to evolving cyber threats. Due to broken input data, specific network scan vulnerabilities could not be assessed.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Email accounts are a primary target for phishing and credential stuffing attacks. Without MFA, a compromised password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's email, leading to further internal compromise, data exfiltration, or business email compromise (BEC) scams. This vulnerability was identified by the organization stating they do not require MFA for email access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee email accounts</li><li>Email server/service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Local computer logins, especially for endpoints accessing sensitive internal resources, are vulnerable to brute-force attacks, credential theft, and pass-the-hash attacks. Without MFA, a compromised local credential can provide an attacker with a foothold into the internal network, potentially leading to lateral movement and broader system compromise. This vulnerability was identified by the organization stating they do not require MFA for computer login.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee workstations/laptops</li><li>Domain controllers (if applicable)</li><li>Local authentication systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Ongoing Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive initial security awareness training, the absence of annual or regular security awareness training for all employees leaves the organization susceptible to evolving social engineering tactics, phishing, and other human-factor vulnerabilities. Employees may forget best practices or not be updated on new threats, increasing the likelihood of successful attacks and human error. This vulnerability was identified by the organization stating they do not do security awareness training for all employees at least once per year.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all email access and computer logins. This critical step will provide an additional layer of security, making it substantially harder for unauthorized users to gain access even if passwords are compromised. Furthermore, establishing a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees is essential. This training should cover current threat landscapes, phishing recognition, data handling best practices, and incident reporting procedures to ensure the entire workforce remains vigilant and informed against evolving cyber threats.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In conclusion, while the organization has some foundational security practices in place, its current readiness is hampered by significant vulnerabilities related to access control and human factors. The absence of MFA for email and computer logins, coupled with the lack of regular, organization-wide security awareness training, presents a 'High' overall risk profile. Addressing these specific areas through the recommended implementations will be crucial in mitigating potential breaches, protecting sensitive data, and fostering a more robust and resilient cybersecurity environment.</p>
