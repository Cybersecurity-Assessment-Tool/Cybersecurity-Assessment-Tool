        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network includes at least one active host with an open FTP service (vsftpd 2.3.4) that permits anonymous logins. Security policies indicate a mixed posture: while Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required for computer logins and an acceptable use policy is in place, MFA is not enforced for email or sensitive data systems. Furthermore, although new employees receive security awareness training, there is no mandatory annual training for all employees. Several workstations are also identified as running an outdated operating system.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Anonymous FTP Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The FTP server (vsftpd 2.3.4) on an active host allows anonymous login. This can lead to unauthorized access to files, data leakage, or the upload of malicious content, depending on the server configuration. This vulnerability was identified via an Nmap scan which showed 'Anonymous FTP login allowed'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>FTP server (vsftpd 2.3.4)</li><li>Host with open port 21</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing or credential stuffing, as a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to an employee's email, potentially leading to data breaches or further network penetration. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if a user's password is compromised, bypassing a crucial layer of security and potentially leading to severe data breaches. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, there is no mandatory annual training for all employees. This means employees may not be updated on the latest threats, best practices, or organizational policies, increasing the risk of human error leading to security incidents (e.g., phishing, social engineering, malware execution). This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Windows Policy - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Computers are running Windows 7. Windows 7 has reached its end-of-life, meaning it no longer receives security updates from Microsoft. This leaves systems vulnerable to known and newly discovered exploits, significantly increasing the risk of compromise and making them a prime target for attackers.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to disable anonymous FTP access immediately and ensure proper authentication and authorization for all FTP services. Consider replacing FTP with more secure protocols like SFTP or FTPS. Implement mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and sensitive data systems to protect against credential compromise and unauthorized access. Establish and implement a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees to keep them informed about current threats and best practices. Finally, upgrade all workstations running Windows 7 to a currently supported operating system, such as Windows 10 or 11, to ensure they receive critical security updates and patches.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization faces several significant security risks, including critical vulnerabilities related to the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for sensitive data systems and email, and high-severity risks from an anonymous FTP server and outdated Windows 7 workstations. While some positive security practices are in place, such as MFA for computer logins and initial employee training, the absence of annual security awareness training and the identified technical vulnerabilities indicate a moderate to high overall risk posture. Addressing these issues is crucial for enhancing the organization's cybersecurity readiness and protecting its assets from potential breaches and compromises.</p>
