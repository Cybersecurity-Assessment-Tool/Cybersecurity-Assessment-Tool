        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, and by conducting annual security awareness training for all employees. However, a review of organizational policies and practices reveals critical gaps in the security posture, particularly concerning access to sensitive data systems, the absence of an Acceptable Use Policy, and the lack of initial security awareness training for new hires. These areas represent significant human-factor and policy-related vulnerabilities that could be exploited.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Multi-Factor Authentication for Sensitive Data - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if credentials are compromised through phishing, malware, or other means. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to sensitive data, leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and reputational damage. This was identified through the organizational data questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Missing Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). An AUP defines the proper and improper use of organizational IT resources, including networks, systems, and data. Without a clear AUP, employees may inadvertently engage in risky behaviors, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive information, leading to increased exposure to cyber threats, legal liabilities, and operational disruptions. This was identified through the organizational data questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational IT resources</li><li>Data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Initial Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees upon their onboarding. While annual training is provided, new hires are a critical entry point for social engineering attacks and other human-factor vulnerabilities. Without immediate training, new employees may not be aware of common cyber threats, organizational security policies, and best practices, making them susceptible to phishing, malware, and other attacks from day one, potentially compromising the organization's security posture. This was identified through the organizational data questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised. Furthermore, a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) should be developed, communicated, and enforced across the organization to clearly define appropriate use of IT resources and minimize risky employee behavior. Finally, a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees must be established as part of the onboarding process to ensure they are equipped with essential security knowledge from day one, complementing the existing annual training. Regular reviews and updates of these policies and training programs are also advised to adapt to evolving threat landscapes.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently exhibits a mixed state of cybersecurity readiness. While strong controls like MFA for email and computer logins, and annual security awareness training are in place, significant vulnerabilities exist due to the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems, the lack of an Acceptable Use Policy, and the omission of initial security awareness training for new employees. Addressing these policy and human-factor gaps is crucial to enhance the overall security posture, reduce the risk of data breaches, and foster a more robust security-aware culture within the organization. Prioritizing these recommendations will significantly improve the organization's resilience against common cyber threats.</p>
