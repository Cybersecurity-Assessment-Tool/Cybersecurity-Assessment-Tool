            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. An employee acceptable use policy is in place, and annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees. However, a gap exists in providing security awareness training for new employees. Network scanning revealed an open SSH port (22), which requires further investigation to ensure it is securely configured and managed.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Open SSH Port (22)",
                        "Overview": "The network scan identified an open SSH port (22). While SSH is a legitimate service for remote administration, an open port can be a target for brute-force attacks or unauthorized access if not properly secured with strong authentication, access controls, and regular patching. The impact could range from unauthorized system access to data exfiltration.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Port 22 (SSH) on scanned host"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of Security Awareness Training for New Employees",
                        "Overview": "The organization currently does not provide security awareness training for new employees. This leaves new hires vulnerable to social engineering attacks, phishing, and other common threats, as they may not be aware of the organization's security policies, best practices, or how to identify and report suspicious activities. This increases the risk of human error leading to security incidents.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "New employees",
                            "Organizational security posture"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "It is highly recommended to implement immediate security awareness training for all new employees as part of their onboarding process to mitigate the risk of human error and social engineering attacks. For the identified open SSH port (22), conduct a thorough review of its configuration. Ensure that strong authentication methods (e.g., key-based authentication, MFA if possible) are enforced, direct root login is disabled, and access is restricted to authorized IP addresses only. Implement a robust patching schedule for the SSH server and monitor its logs for suspicious activity.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization has a solid foundation with MFA implementation and annual security awareness training. However, the absence of security awareness training for new employees and the presence of an open SSH port represent significant vulnerabilities that could be exploited. Addressing these areas will further strengthen the organization's overall security posture and readiness against potential cyber threats."
