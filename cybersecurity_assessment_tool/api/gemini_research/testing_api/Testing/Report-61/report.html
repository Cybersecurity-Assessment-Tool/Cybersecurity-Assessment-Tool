        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, and maintaining an employee acceptable use policy. New employees receive security awareness training. However, critical gaps exist, including the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems and a lack of annual security awareness training for all employees. The network scan identified an Nginx web server running an outdated version (1.18.0) on port 443, which is susceptible to known vulnerabilities.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or other means. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to sensitive data, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization conducts security awareness training for new employees but does not provide annual training for all employees. This leaves existing employees susceptible to evolving social engineering tactics (e.g., advanced phishing, pretexting) and general security best practice lapses. A lack of regular training increases the likelihood of successful cyberattacks originating from human error or manipulation, potentially leading to malware infections, data loss, or unauthorized access. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Nginx Server - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nginx web server running version 1.18.0 is outdated. This version was released in April 2020 and has known vulnerabilities, such as CVE-2021-23017 (HTTP/2 request smuggling), which could allow an attacker to bypass security controls, access sensitive information, or perform other malicious actions. Running outdated software exposes the organization to known exploits for which patches are available in newer versions, increasing the risk of server compromise and service disruption. This was identified via network scan data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Web server (nginx 1.18.0)</li><li>Port 443</li><li>Hosted web applications</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems immediately. This will significantly enhance protection against unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised. Furthermore, establish a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees to ensure they are continuously updated on the latest cyber threats and best practices, thereby reducing the risk of social engineering attacks and human error. Finally, the Nginx web server should be updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities and improve overall security posture. Regular patching and updates for all software and systems should be a standard operational procedure.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has implemented some essential security measures like MFA for email and computer logins, and initial security training, significant vulnerabilities remain. The absence of MFA for sensitive data systems, the lack of ongoing security awareness training for all employees, and the use of outdated server software collectively present a heightened risk of data breaches and successful cyberattacks. Addressing these critical areas is paramount to improving the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and protecting its assets.</p>
