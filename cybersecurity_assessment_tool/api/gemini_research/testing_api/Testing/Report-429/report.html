        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to cybersecurity through its acceptable use policy and regular security awareness training for all employees. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is mandated for email and sensitive data systems, which is a strong security practice. However, a critical vulnerability was identified: an open port (8080) exposing a service titled 'TOP SECRET DB'. This poses an immediate and severe risk of data exposure. Additionally, the lack of MFA for computer logins represents a significant gap, increasing the risk of unauthorized access to internal systems via compromised credentials.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed Sensitive Database Interface - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open port (8080) was identified on a host, exposing a service with the title 'TOP SECRET DB'. This strongly indicates a potentially unauthenticated or weakly authenticated interface to a database containing highly sensitive information. The direct accessibility of such a service from the network presents an extreme risk of data breach, unauthorized access, and compromise of critical organizational assets. This vulnerability was identified via an Nmap scan using the http-title script.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li><li>Host exposing port 8080</li><li>TOP SECRET DB service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee workstations and internal systems if credentials are compromised through phishing, malware, or brute-force attacks. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to a user's machine and potentially allow them to pivot to other systems within the network. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers</li><li>Internal network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediate action is required to address the 'TOP SECRET DB' service exposed on port 8080. This service must be thoroughly investigated to determine its purpose, content, and intended access. If it contains sensitive data, access should be immediately restricted to trusted internal networks only, ideally behind a firewall and VPN, with robust authentication and authorization mechanisms, including MFA. Furthermore, mandatory MFA should be implemented for all computer logins across the organization to mitigate the risk of credential compromise. An appropriate MFA solution should be evaluated and deployed, integrated with existing identity management systems, and accompanied by comprehensive employee training. The organization should continue its strong security awareness training programs and regularly review its acceptable use policies to ensure ongoing effectiveness.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has established a good foundation with security awareness training and acceptable use policies, and has implemented MFA for email and sensitive data systems, critical vulnerabilities remain. The exposed 'TOP SECRET DB' service on port 8080 represents an immediate and severe data breach risk, and the absence of MFA for computer logins significantly weakens the overall security posture. Addressing these high-priority risks is paramount to enhancing the organization's cybersecurity readiness and protecting its sensitive assets.</p>
