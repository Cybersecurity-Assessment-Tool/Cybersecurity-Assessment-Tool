        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Based on the provided data, the organization's network appears to have a minimal attack surface from external network scans, with no open ports identified. Internally, the organization has implemented multi-factor authentication (MFA) for computer logins and access to sensitive data systems, and has established an employee acceptable use policy and regular security awareness training. However, a critical gap exists in the security posture regarding email access.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. Compromised email accounts can lead to business email compromise (BEC) attacks, data exfiltration, and further lateral movement within the network. This was identified through the organizational data indicating "Do you require MFA to access email?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee email accounts</li><li>Email servers</li><li>Organizational data accessible via email</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>It is strongly recommended that the organization implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access immediately. This will significantly enhance the security of employee email accounts against various credential-based attacks. Additionally, while the network scan showed no open ports, continuous monitoring and regular vulnerability assessments should be conducted to ensure the external attack surface remains minimal. The existing security awareness training should emphasize the importance of MFA and the risks associated with its absence, particularly for email.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to cybersecurity through its use of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, along with established security policies and training programs. The external network perimeter appears hardened with no open ports detected. However, the absence of MFA for email access represents a critical vulnerability that could expose the organization to significant risks, including data breaches and financial fraud. Addressing this specific gap is paramount to improving the overall security posture and readiness against common cyber threats.</p>
