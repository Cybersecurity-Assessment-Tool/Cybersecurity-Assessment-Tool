        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, and provides security awareness training for new employees, indicating a foundational level of security awareness. However, significant gaps exist in critical areas, including the lack of MFA for sensitive data systems, the absence of an employee acceptable use policy, and insufficient recurring security awareness training for all employees. These deficiencies expose the organization to elevated risks of unauthorized data access, misuse of IT resources, and susceptibility to evolving cyber threats.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if credentials are compromised through phishing, malware, or other means. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to sensitive data, leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and reputational damage. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'Do you require MFA to access sensitive data systems?':'No'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This means there are no formal guidelines or rules for how employees should use company IT resources, including networks, devices, and data. The absence of an AUP can lead to misuse of company assets, increased risk of malware infections, data leakage, and legal liabilities, as employees may unknowingly engage in insecure practices or activities not aligned with company security objectives. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'Does your organization have an employee acceptable use policy?':'No'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources (networks, devices, data)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Recurring Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This leaves the workforce vulnerable to evolving cyber threats, as security best practices and threat landscapes change rapidly. Without regular refreshers, employees may forget critical security protocols, become complacent, or fail to recognize new attack vectors like advanced phishing techniques, increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'Does your organization do security awareness training for all employees at least once per year?':'No'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access. A comprehensive employee acceptable use policy (AUP) should be developed, communicated, and enforced to establish clear guidelines for the responsible use of company IT resources. Furthermore, a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees must be established to ensure continuous education on evolving cyber threats and best practices. Regular internal audits should also be considered to ensure policy compliance and identify further areas for security improvement.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently exhibits a moderate level of cybersecurity readiness, with commendable practices such as MFA for email and computer logins, and initial security awareness training for new hires. However, critical vulnerabilities, including the lack of MFA for sensitive data systems, the absence of an acceptable use policy, and insufficient recurring security awareness training, significantly elevate the risk of data breaches and other security incidents. Addressing these gaps is paramount to strengthening the overall security posture, protecting sensitive information, and ensuring long-term resilience against cyber threats.</p>
