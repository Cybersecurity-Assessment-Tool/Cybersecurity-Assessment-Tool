        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization operates a network with at least one host exposing Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) on port 3389. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is utilized for email access, it is not enforced for computer logins or sensitive data systems. Additionally, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or annual training for all staff.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>RDP Exposure - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed to the internet, allowing potential attackers to attempt brute-force attacks or exploit vulnerabilities in the RDP service. This was identified by an open port scan on port 3389 (ms-wbt-server). The impact could lead to unauthorized access to internal systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately close public access to port 3389 or restrict it to trusted IP addresses. For secure remote access, implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution. Beyond this, critical security enhancements include implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy. Crucially, establish mandatory security awareness training for all new employees and conduct annual refresher training for all staff to foster a strong security culture and educate against common threats.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces critical security vulnerabilities, primarily due to an exposed RDP service, which presents a significant attack surface. The absence of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, coupled with a lack of an acceptable use policy and security awareness training, indicates a low state of readiness against common cyber threats. Addressing these foundational security gaps is paramount to improving the overall security posture and reducing the risk of a successful cyberattack.</p>
