        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and sensitive data systems, and by having an employee acceptable use policy and security awareness training for new hires. However, the network scan data provided was inconclusive, showing no specific targets or open ports, thus limiting the ability to assess technical network vulnerabilities. Key areas of concern identified from organizational data include the lack of MFA for email access and the absence of annual security awareness training for all employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Email Security - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. Compromised email accounts can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and further network penetration. This vulnerability was identified from the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on email access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee email accounts</li><li>Organizational data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Employee Security Awareness - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. This leaves employees vulnerable to evolving social engineering tactics, phishing attempts, and other cyber threats, increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents. Regular, recurring training is crucial to keep employees informed about current threats and best practices, reinforcing a strong security culture. This vulnerability was identified from the organizational data indicating 'No' for annual security awareness training.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network security</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access. This critical step will significantly enhance protection against unauthorized account access. Furthermore, a comprehensive and mandatory annual security awareness training program should be established for all employees. This training should cover current threat landscapes, phishing recognition, secure browsing habits, and data handling best practices to reduce the risk of human-factor vulnerabilities. Regular reinforcement of security policies and practices will foster a more resilient security posture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has established some essential security controls, such as MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, and initial security training for new employees, critical gaps exist in email security and ongoing employee security awareness. The absence of MFA for email access and annual security awareness training represents significant vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. Addressing these specific areas is paramount to enhancing the overall security posture, reducing the risk of successful cyberattacks, and fostering a more robust security-conscious environment.</p>
