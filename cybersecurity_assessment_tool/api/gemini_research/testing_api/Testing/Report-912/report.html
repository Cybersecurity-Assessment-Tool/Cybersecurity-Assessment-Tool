        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>This cybersecurity assessment is based solely on the provided organizational data, as network scan data and current risks information were unavailable. The organization demonstrates good practices in requiring MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, maintaining an acceptable use policy, and conducting annual security awareness training for all employees. However, critical gaps exist in email security and the onboarding process for new employees, which pose significant risks to the organization's overall security posture.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of email account compromise through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks. A compromised email account can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information, business email compromise (BEC) scams, data exfiltration, and further lateral movement within the network. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'Do you require MFA to access email?':'No'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>User accounts</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Communication channels</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. This leaves new hires vulnerable to social engineering attacks, phishing attempts, and other common cyber threats due to a lack of understanding of organizational security policies, best practices, and threat landscapes. New employees, often eager to please and less familiar with internal protocols, can inadvertently become an easy target for attackers, potentially leading to data breaches or system compromises. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'Does your organization do security awareness training for new employees?':'No'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Overall security posture</li><li>Internal systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access. This crucial step will significantly enhance the security of user accounts and protect against unauthorized access. Additionally, a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees should be developed and implemented, ideally as part of their onboarding process and prior to granting full system access. This training should cover common threats, organizational policies, and best practices to ensure new hires are equipped to identify and report potential security incidents. Furthermore, a comprehensive technical vulnerability scan and penetration test are advised to gain a complete understanding of the network's security posture, as this assessment was limited by the absence of technical scan data.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Based on the available organizational data, the organization exhibits a mixed security posture. While some foundational controls like MFA for sensitive systems and annual security training are in place, the lack of MFA for email and the absence of security awareness training for new employees represent critical vulnerabilities. These gaps could expose the organization to significant risks, including account compromise, data breaches, and successful social engineering attacks. A full and comprehensive cybersecurity assessment, including technical scans, is essential to fully understand and address all potential threats.</p>
