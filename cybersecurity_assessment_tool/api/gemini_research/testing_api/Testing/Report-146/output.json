            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network currently presents several critical security vulnerabilities. A network scan identified an outdated FTP server (vsftpd 2.3.4) allowing anonymous login, which poses a significant risk for unauthorized access and data exposure. Furthermore, the organization's internal policies reveal a lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems, leaving these critical access points highly susceptible to credential compromise. Employee security posture is also weak due to the absence of an acceptable use policy and a complete lack of security awareness training for both new and existing employees. Additionally, workstations are running outdated Windows 7, which is no longer supported and highly vulnerable.",

                        "Risk": "Insufficient Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or annually for all employees. This leaves employees unprepared to identify and respond to common cyber threats like phishing, social engineering, and malware, significantly increasing the likelihood of human-factor security breaches.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, immediate action is required across several fronts. Firstly, the anonymous FTP access must be disabled, the vsftpd service should be updated to a current, supported version, and consideration should be given to migrating to a more secure protocol like SFTP or FTPS. All workstations running Windows 7 must be upgraded to a currently supported operating system (e.g., Windows 10 or 11) to ensure they receive critical security updates. Crucially, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be implemented and enforced for all email accounts and access to sensitive data systems to significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access. Furthermore, the organization needs to develop and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy, clearly outlining expected behavior and security responsibilities. Finally, a mandatory security awareness training program should be established for all new hires and conducted annually for all employees to educate them on identifying and responding to cyber threats.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces a significant array of cybersecurity vulnerabilities, ranging from critical technical misconfigurations like anonymous FTP access and outdated operating systems to severe gaps in foundational security policies and employee training. The absence of MFA for email and sensitive data systems represents a critical weakness that could lead to devastating data breaches. Without immediate and comprehensive remediation, the organization's readiness against cyber threats remains low, exposing it to substantial operational, financial, and reputational risks."
