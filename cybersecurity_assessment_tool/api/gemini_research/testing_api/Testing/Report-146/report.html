        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently presents several critical security vulnerabilities. A network scan identified an outdated FTP server (vsftpd 2.3.4) allowing anonymous login, which poses a significant risk for unauthorized access and data exposure. Furthermore, the organization's internal policies reveal a lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems, leaving these critical access points highly susceptible to credential compromise. Employee security posture is also weak due to the absence of an acceptable use policy and a complete lack of security awareness training for both new and existing employees. Additionally, workstations are running outdated Windows 7, which is no longer supported and highly vulnerable.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Anonymous FTP Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The FTP server (vsftpd 2.3.4) on port 21 allows anonymous login. This configuration can lead to unauthorized access to files, data leakage, or even server compromise if write permissions are misconfigured. The service version is also outdated, potentially containing known vulnerabilities.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>FTP Server (vsftpd 2.3.4)</li><li>Port 21</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Windows Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Computers are running Windows 7, an operating system that has reached its end-of-life and no longer receives security updates. This exposes workstations to known and unpatched vulnerabilities, making them easy targets for malware and cyberattacks.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing or brute-force attacks, potentially leading to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and unauthorized access to sensitive communications.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email System</li><li>User Accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised, posing a severe risk of data breach, regulatory non-compliance, and significant financial and reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive Data Systems</li><li>User Accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines, employees may engage in activities that introduce security risks, such as using unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling company data, leading to potential security incidents and legal liabilities.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All Employees</li><li>Organizational Security Posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or annually for all employees. This leaves employees unprepared to identify and respond to common cyber threats like phishing, social engineering, and malware, significantly increasing the likelihood of human-factor security breaches.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All Employees</li><li>Organizational Security Posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, immediate action is required across several fronts. Firstly, the anonymous FTP access must be disabled, the vsftpd service should be updated to a current, supported version, and consideration should be given to migrating to a more secure protocol like SFTP or FTPS. All workstations running Windows 7 must be upgraded to a currently supported operating system (e.g., Windows 10 or 11) to ensure they receive critical security updates. Crucially, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be implemented and enforced for all email accounts and access to sensitive data systems to significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access. Furthermore, the organization needs to develop and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy, clearly outlining expected behavior and security responsibilities. Finally, a mandatory security awareness training program should be established for all new hires and conducted annually for all employees to educate them on identifying and responding to cyber threats.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces a significant array of cybersecurity vulnerabilities, ranging from critical technical misconfigurations like anonymous FTP access and outdated operating systems to severe gaps in foundational security policies and employee training. The absence of MFA for email and sensitive data systems represents a critical weakness that could lead to devastating data breaches. Without immediate and comprehensive remediation, the organization's readiness against cyber threats remains low, exposing it to substantial operational, financial, and reputational risks.</p>
