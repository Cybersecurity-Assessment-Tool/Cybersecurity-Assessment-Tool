        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The provided network scan data was empty, indicating no specific technical network vulnerabilities were identified through automated scanning. However, an assessment of the organization's security posture based on provided organizational data reveals several critical policy and procedural gaps. While the organization requires MFA for computer logins and conducts annual security awareness training for all employees, significant vulnerabilities exist concerning the protection of email and sensitive data systems, as well as the onboarding process for new employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Multi-Factor Authentication for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee inboxes if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. Email accounts often contain sensitive information and can be used as a pivot point for further attacks within the network. This was identified from the organizational data indicating "Do you require MFA to access email?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email accounts</li><li>User credentials</li><li>Communication channels</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Multi-Factor Authentication for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are stolen or guessed. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to sensitive information, leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and significant reputational damage. This was identified from the organizational data indicating "Do you require MFA to access sensitive data systems?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>Confidential information</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Security Awareness Training for New Hires - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. This means new hires may not be immediately aware of the organization's security policies, common threats (like phishing), and best practices for protecting sensitive information and systems. This gap can lead to new employees inadvertently introducing risks, such as falling for social engineering attacks or mishandling data, before they receive annual training. This was identified from the organizational data indicating "Does your organization do security awareness training for new employees?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li><li>Data handling practices</li><li>Phishing susceptibility</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and sensitive data systems immediately. This will significantly enhance protection against credential theft and unauthorized access. Furthermore, a comprehensive security awareness training program should be established for all new employees as part of their onboarding process, ensuring they are equipped with essential security knowledge from day one. Regular reviews of MFA implementation across all critical systems and continuous updates to security awareness training content are also advised to maintain a robust security posture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently exhibits a mixed state of cybersecurity readiness. While some foundational controls like MFA for computer logins and annual security awareness training are in place, critical gaps exist in protecting email and sensitive data systems with MFA, and in providing initial security awareness training for new hires. Addressing these vulnerabilities is paramount to reducing the overall risk of data breaches, unauthorized access, and human-factor related security incidents, thereby strengthening the organization's defense against evolving cyber threats.</p>
