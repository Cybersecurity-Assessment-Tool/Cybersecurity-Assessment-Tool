        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan indicates that port 80 is currently closed. However, a vulnerability concerning an unencrypted web server on port 80 has been identified, which, if active, could expose unencrypted traffic. The organization has implemented multi-factor authentication (MFA) for computer logins and sensitive data systems, but not for email access. While annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees, there is no specific training for new employees, and an employee acceptable use policy is currently absent.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unencrypted Web Server - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Port 80 is open, exposing potential unencrypted web traffic. This could lead to data interception if sensitive information is transmitted over HTTP. The risk was identified as a potential service running on an unencrypted port.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is crucial to verify the status of port 80. If a web service is intended to run, it must be secured with SSL/TLS encryption to protect all web traffic; otherwise, ensure the port remains closed. Furthermore, implementing MFA for email access is a critical step to enhance account security against unauthorized access. Developing and enforcing a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy will establish clear guidelines for technology usage and data handling. Additionally, establishing a dedicated security awareness training program for new employees will ensure they are equipped with essential security knowledge from the outset, complementing the existing annual training for all staff.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational level of security with MFA for critical systems and annual security awareness training. However, there are notable areas for improvement, including the potential for an unencrypted web server (despite scan data showing port 80 closed), the lack of MFA for email, the absence of an acceptable use policy, and the need for new employee security training. Addressing these vulnerabilities and policy gaps will significantly enhance the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and readiness against common threats.</p>
