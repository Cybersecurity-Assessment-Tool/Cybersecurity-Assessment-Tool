        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, which is a strong foundational security measure. However, significant gaps exist in the human-centric security posture, as there is no employee acceptable use policy in place, nor is security awareness training conducted for new employees or annually for all employees. A network scan identified an open SSH port (22), which, while not inherently a vulnerability, requires proper configuration and monitoring to prevent unauthorized access.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed SSH Service - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The network scan identified an open SSH port (22) on an external-facing IP address. While SSH itself is a secure protocol, an exposed SSH service, especially if not properly secured with strong authentication, rate limiting, and intrusion detection, presents a critical risk for unauthorized access, brute-force attacks, and potential system compromise. The vulnerability was identified via an Nmap scan showing port 22 as open.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>External IP Address</li><li>Port 22 (SSH)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This absence means there are no formal guidelines or rules for employees regarding the appropriate use of company assets, networks, and data. This can lead to misuse of resources, increased risk of data breaches, and non-compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. This vulnerability was identified through organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All Employees</li><li>Company Assets</li><li>Network Infrastructure</li><li>Data Systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees, nor does it provide annual training for all employees. This significant gap leaves employees vulnerable to social engineering attacks (phishing, pretexting), malware, and other human-centric threats. A lack of awareness can lead to accidental data breaches, system infections, and non-compliance with security protocols, severely weakening the overall security posture. This vulnerability was identified through organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All Employees</li><li>Organizational Data</li><li>IT Systems</li><li>Network</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately secure the exposed SSH service by implementing strong, multi-factor authentication, restricting access to trusted IP ranges, disabling root login, and utilizing key-based authentication. Additionally, implement intrusion detection systems with rate limiting and ensure regular patching. Concurrently, develop and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy that clearly outlines expectations for using company resources and handling data. Establish mandatory security awareness training for all new employees during onboarding and implement annual refresher training for all employees, covering topics such as phishing, malware, password hygiene, and data protection. The existing implementation of MFA for critical access points is commendable and should be maintained.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has a commendable foundation with Multi-Factor Authentication implemented across key access points, its overall security readiness is significantly hampered by critical gaps in human-centric security measures and an exposed network service. The absence of an acceptable use policy and comprehensive security awareness training for employees creates a substantial attack surface for social engineering and internal misuse. Coupled with an open SSH port, these vulnerabilities present a high risk of unauthorized access and data compromise. Immediate action on policy development, employee training, and SSH hardening is crucial to elevate the organization's security posture and readiness against evolving cyber threats.</p>
