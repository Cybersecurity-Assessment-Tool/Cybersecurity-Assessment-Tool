        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security with multi-factor authentication (MFA) implemented for computer logins and an annual security awareness training program for all employees. An acceptable use policy is also in place. However, critical gaps exist in the application of MFA for email and sensitive data systems, and new employees do not receive initial security awareness training, leaving potential vectors for compromise.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Email accounts are a primary target for phishing and credential stuffing attacks. Without MFA, a compromised password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's inbox, potentially leading to further internal system access, data exfiltration, or business email compromise (BEC) scams. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating "No" for MFA on email access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li><li>Organizational communication</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Direct access to systems containing sensitive data without MFA significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. If an attacker gains an employee's credentials, they could potentially access and exfiltrate critical organizational or customer data. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating "No" for MFA on sensitive data systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>Critical business applications</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees are often unfamiliar with an organization's specific security policies, common threats, and reporting procedures. The lack of initial security awareness training leaves them more susceptible to social engineering attacks, phishing, and inadvertently introducing vulnerabilities. This was identified through the organizational data stating "No" for security awareness training for new employees.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li><li>Incident response</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all email access and sensitive data systems. This will provide a crucial layer of defense against credential theft and unauthorized access. Furthermore, a mandatory security awareness training program should be established for all new employees to ensure they are equipped with essential cybersecurity knowledge from day one. Regular review and enhancement of the annual security awareness training are also advised to address evolving threat landscapes.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has some foundational security controls in place, such as MFA for computer logins and annual security awareness training, critical vulnerabilities exist due to the absence of MFA for email and sensitive data systems, and a lack of initial security awareness training for new employees. Addressing these gaps is paramount to mitigating the risk of data breaches, unauthorized access, and successful social engineering attacks, thereby improving the overall cybersecurity readiness.</p>
