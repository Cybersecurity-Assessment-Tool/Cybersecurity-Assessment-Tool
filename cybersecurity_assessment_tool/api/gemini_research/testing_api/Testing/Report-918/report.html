        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to multi-factor authentication (MFA), requiring it for email, computer logins, and access to sensitive data systems. An employee acceptable use policy is also in place, and annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees. However, a gap exists in security awareness training for new employees. Network scanning revealed minimal open ports, with port 80 identified as closed. Despite this, a previously identified vulnerability regarding an unencrypted web server on port 80 was noted, suggesting a potential past issue or a discrepancy in scan results that warrants further investigation.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unencrypted Web Server - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Port 80 is open, indicating that an unencrypted HTTP service might be running. This poses a risk of sensitive data being intercepted in transit, compromising confidentiality. The impact could lead to unauthorized disclosure of information. This vulnerability was identified through a security assessment, noting the presence of an unencrypted web service.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate identified risks and enhance the overall security posture, it is recommended to investigate the discrepancy regarding port 80's status and, if an unencrypted web server is indeed active, ensure it is either closed or secured with SSL/TLS encryption. Implementing SSL/TLS for all web services is a crucial long-term fix to protect data in transit. Furthermore, it is strongly advised to establish and implement mandatory security awareness training for all new employees during their onboarding process to ensure they are equipped with essential cybersecurity knowledge from day one. Regularly review and update security policies and training materials to address evolving threats.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization has a solid foundation with widespread MFA implementation and an acceptable use policy. Annual security awareness training is a positive step, but the absence of training for new employees represents a significant vulnerability. The identified risk of an unencrypted web server, despite conflicting scan data, highlights the need for thorough verification and immediate remediation if active. Addressing these areas will significantly improve the organization's readiness against common cyber threats and strengthen its overall security posture.</p>
