        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan identified an Nginx web server (version 1.18.0) running on port 443 (HTTPS). Organizational data indicates a mixed security posture regarding policies and training. While MFA is required for sensitive data systems and annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees, there are significant gaps. Specifically, MFA is not required for email access or computer logins, and new employees do not receive initial security awareness training. An acceptable use policy is in place.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email if credentials are compromised through phishing, credential stuffing, or other means. A successful compromise could lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, or further attacks within the organization.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee email accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not enforced for logging into computers. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if login credentials are stolen, guessed, or brute-forced. Without a second factor, a compromised password can grant an attacker direct access to an employee's workstation, potentially leading to lateral movement within the network and access to sensitive data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network endpoints</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive dedicated security awareness training upon joining the organization. This means new hires may lack immediate understanding of critical cybersecurity threats (e.g., phishing, social engineering) and organizational security policies from day one, making them potential targets for attackers and increasing the risk of human error-induced security incidents.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security culture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Nginx Server Version - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nginx web server identified on port 443 is running version 1.18.0. This version was released in April 2020 and is no longer actively maintained. Older software versions often contain known vulnerabilities that have been patched in newer releases. Operating an outdated server increases the risk of exploitation by attackers leveraging publicly known CVEs, potentially leading to denial of service, data breaches, or unauthorized access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Web server (nginx 1.18.0)</li><li>Port 443</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and computer logins. This critical step will provide a robust defense against credential compromise. Furthermore, a mandatory security awareness training program should be established for all new employees, ensuring they are equipped with essential cybersecurity knowledge from their first day. The Nginx web server should be promptly updated to the latest stable version to mitigate risks associated with known vulnerabilities in older software. Regular vulnerability scanning and patch management processes should also be established or enhanced.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several notable cybersecurity risks stemming from both technical and policy-related gaps. While some foundational elements like an acceptable use policy and annual training are present, the absence of MFA for critical access points (email and computer logins) and a lack of initial security training for new hires represent significant vulnerabilities. Additionally, an outdated web server poses a technical risk. Addressing these issues proactively is crucial for improving the overall security readiness and resilience against potential cyber threats.</p>
