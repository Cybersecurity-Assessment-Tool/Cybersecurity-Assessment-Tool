        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The network scan indicated no open ports, suggesting a potentially hardened external perimeter or a limited scope of the scan. Internally, the organization demonstrates good security practices by enforcing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and computer logins, and by conducting regular security awareness training for all employees. An acceptable use policy is also in place.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information in the event of compromised credentials. If an attacker gains access to a user's username and password, they could potentially access sensitive data without an additional layer of authentication. This vulnerability was identified through the review of organizational security policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>It is strongly recommended that the organization implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems immediately. This will add a crucial layer of security, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access even if primary credentials are compromised. Furthermore, consider expanding the scope of network scans to include internal systems and conduct regular, comprehensive vulnerability assessments and penetration testing to identify and address potential weaknesses proactively. Continue with the established practices of MFA for email and computer logins, and maintain regular security awareness training for all employees.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the external network scan did not reveal immediate technical vulnerabilities, a critical gap exists in the organization's security posture: the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for sensitive data systems. This oversight poses a high risk to the confidentiality and integrity of critical information. Addressing this specific policy weakness is paramount to enhancing the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and protecting its most valuable assets.</p>
