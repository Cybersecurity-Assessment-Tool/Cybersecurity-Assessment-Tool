        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan indicates an active host, with port 80 reported as closed. However, a specific vulnerability assessment identified an unencrypted web server, suggesting a potential misconfiguration or a discrepancy in scan results, with port 80 being a concern. The organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and sensitive data systems, which are positive security measures. However, there is a critical lack of MFA for email access. Furthermore, the organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or annually for all employees, which represents a significant human-factor risk. An acceptable use policy is in place.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unencrypted Web Server - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An unencrypted web server was identified, with port 80 potentially open, exposing web traffic to interception. This allows attackers to capture sensitive information transmitted over the network. The presence of an unencrypted service indicates a lack of secure communication protocols.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing, as a single compromised password can grant full access to an employee's email.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email System</li><li>Employee Accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks security awareness training for new employees and does not conduct annual training for all employees. This leaves the workforce vulnerable to social engineering attacks, phishing, malware, and other human-factor exploits, as employees may not be equipped to identify and respond to threats.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All Employees</li><li>Organizational Data</li><li>Network Infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately address the unencrypted web server by ensuring port 80 is closed if not actively used, and implementing SSL/TLS encryption for all web services to protect data in transit. Crucially, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be implemented for all email access to prevent account compromise. Furthermore, a comprehensive security awareness training program should be established, including mandatory training for all new employees and annual refresher training for the entire workforce, to educate staff on identifying and responding to common cyber threats such as phishing and social engineering. Regular network scans and vulnerability assessments should also be conducted to ensure ongoing security posture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In conclusion, while the organization has taken positive steps by implementing MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, significant vulnerabilities exist. The lack of MFA for email and the complete absence of security awareness training for employees represent critical gaps that expose the organization to a high risk of credential compromise and human-factor attacks. The identified unencrypted web server also poses a risk of data interception. Addressing these areas is paramount to enhancing the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and reducing its attack surface.</p>
