        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network appears to have basic connectivity, with port 80 showing as closed based on the Nmap scan. However, a review of organizational policies reveals several critical gaps in security posture. Specifically, the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins presents significant vulnerabilities, as compromised credentials could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive systems and data. Furthermore, the lack of an employee acceptable use policy and the omission of security awareness training for new employees increase the human factor risk, potentially leading to inadvertent security breaches or policy violations. While annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees, the initial onboarding process for new hires is a notable weakness.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to email in the event of compromised credentials (e.g., via phishing or brute-force attacks). Email often contains sensitive information and can be used for further attacks (e.g., password resets for other services).</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are stolen or guessed. Without a second factor, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's workstation and potentially the internal network.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network access</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. An AUP defines the proper use of company assets, networks, and data, setting clear expectations for employee behavior. Without one, employees may unknowingly engage in risky activities, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive data, leading to increased security incidents and potential legal liabilities.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company assets</li><li>Network</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often unfamiliar with the company's specific security policies, procedures, and common threats. This makes them particularly susceptible to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) and other security blunders, posing an immediate risk to the organization's security posture from day one.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Company data</li><li>Network</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, the organization should immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and computer logins to significantly enhance credential security. Developing and enforcing a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy is crucial to establish clear guidelines for the proper use of company resources and data. Additionally, a mandatory security awareness training program must be introduced for all new employees during their onboarding process to ensure they are equipped with essential security knowledge from day one. Regular reviews and updates of security policies and training materials are also recommended to adapt to evolving threat landscapes.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several significant cybersecurity risks primarily stemming from policy and procedural deficiencies rather than immediate network vulnerabilities based on the provided scan data. The absence of MFA for critical access points (email and computer logins) and the lack of foundational security policies and training for new employees create substantial exposure to credential compromise and human error. While some positive steps are taken with annual security training, these gaps indicate a moderate to high overall risk posture that requires immediate attention to prevent potential data breaches and unauthorized system access. Addressing these issues will significantly improve the organization's readiness against common cyber threats.</p>
