        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open MySQL port (3306). Internally, the organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, or sensitive data systems. While an employee acceptable use policy is in place and security awareness training is conducted for new employees, annual security awareness training for all employees is not performed.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The MySQL database port 3306 is openly accessible on the network. This exposure allows potential attackers to attempt unauthorized access to the database, which could lead to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service. The risk was identified through network scanning, which showed port 3306 in an open state.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for accessing email, logging into computers, or accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised, as a single factor (password) is the only barrier to entry. This vulnerability was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email access</li><li>Computer logins</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. This oversight means employees may not be regularly updated on the latest cybersecurity threats, best practices, and organizational policies, increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents like phishing attacks or malware infections. This vulnerability was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted IP addresses or internal systems. For long-term security, consider placing the database behind a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or implementing a robust application-level authentication and authorization system. Crucially, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be implemented across all critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, to significantly enhance credential security. Furthermore, the organization should establish and enforce a policy for mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees to ensure continuous education on evolving cyber threats and best practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks due to an exposed database port and, more critically, a complete lack of Multi-Factor Authentication across key access points. While some foundational security practices like an acceptable use policy and new employee training are in place, the absence of annual security awareness training for all employees further weakens the human element of defense. Addressing these vulnerabilities, particularly the implementation of MFA and securing the database, is paramount to improving the organization's overall security posture and readiness against cyber threats.</p>
