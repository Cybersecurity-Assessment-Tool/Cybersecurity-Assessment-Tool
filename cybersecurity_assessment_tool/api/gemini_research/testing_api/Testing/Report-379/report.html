        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open SSH port (22) on at least one host. This port, while essential for remote administration, presents a potential attack surface if not adequately secured. From an organizational policy standpoint, the company requires MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, which is a positive security measure. However, a critical gap exists as MFA is not mandated for email access. Furthermore, the organization lacks both new employee and annual security awareness training for all employees, indicating a significant vulnerability to human-factor risks.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unsecured SSH Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH port (22) was detected on a network host. While SSH is a secure protocol for remote access, if not properly configured (e.g., weak passwords, root login enabled, lack of key-based authentication, or outdated SSH daemon), it can be exploited for unauthorized access, brute-force attacks, or remote code execution. This poses a significant risk to the integrity and confidentiality of the affected server and potentially the broader network.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Server with open port 22</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. Email is a primary target for phishing, credential stuffing, and other account compromise attacks. Without MFA, a successful compromise of an employee's email password grants an attacker full access to their inbox, potentially enabling Business Email Compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, or lateral movement through information gathering.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee email accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Regular Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees, nor does it provide annual training for all employees. This leaves the workforce vulnerable to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, vishing, smishing), malware, and other human-factor exploits. A lack of awareness significantly increases the likelihood of successful attacks that bypass technical controls, leading to potential data breaches, financial loss, or system compromise.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement robust security measures for the open SSH port, including disabling root login, enforcing strong password policies, utilizing key-based authentication, and regularly patching the SSH daemon. Immediately implement MFA for all email access to significantly reduce the risk of account compromise. Furthermore, establish and enforce a comprehensive security awareness training program for all new hires and conduct mandatory annual refreshers for all employees to educate them on common threats and best security practices. Consider implementing an employee acceptable use policy if one is not already in place, and ensure it is regularly reviewed and communicated.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems. However, critical vulnerabilities exist with an open SSH port requiring immediate hardening, the absence of MFA for email access, and a complete lack of security awareness training for employees. These gaps expose the organization to significant risks, including unauthorized system access, email account compromise, and successful social engineering attacks. Addressing these areas is paramount to enhancing the overall cybersecurity posture and readiness.</p>
