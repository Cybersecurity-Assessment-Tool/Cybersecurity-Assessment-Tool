        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network security posture, based on the provided data, indicates a mixed level of readiness. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for computer logins and sensitive data systems, a significant gap exists in its application for email access. Furthermore, the organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct security awareness training for new employees, which are critical components of a robust security framework. No technical vulnerabilities were identified through network scans or current risk assessments provided.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. Email accounts often serve as a gateway to other systems and contain sensitive information, making them a prime target for attackers. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on email access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li><li>Sensitive data accessible via email</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. Without an AUP, employees may not have clear guidelines on the appropriate use of company IT resources, internet, and email, leading to potential misuse, data breaches, or introduction of malware. This absence can result in inconsistent security practices and increased risk of insider threats or accidental data exposure. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for an acceptable use policy.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All IT systems</li><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network resources</li><li>Data integrity</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. This means new hires may not be adequately informed about common cyber threats (e.g., phishing, social engineering), company security policies, and best practices from the outset. This oversight increases the likelihood of new employees inadvertently falling victim to attacks or making security errors, potentially compromising the organization's security posture. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for security awareness training for new employees.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employee onboarding process</li><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network security</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access to prevent unauthorized account compromise. Developing and enforcing a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) is crucial to establish clear guidelines for IT resource usage and mitigate risks associated with employee behavior. Furthermore, integrating mandatory security awareness training into the onboarding process for all new employees will ensure they are equipped with essential cybersecurity knowledge from day one, complementing the existing annual training for all staff. Regularly review and update these policies and training programs to adapt to evolving threat landscapes.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, and conducting annual security awareness training for existing employees. However, critical vulnerabilities exist in the lack of MFA for email, the absence of an acceptable use policy, and the omission of security awareness training for new hires. Addressing these policy and process gaps is essential to significantly improve the overall security readiness and reduce the risk of common cyber threats.</p>
