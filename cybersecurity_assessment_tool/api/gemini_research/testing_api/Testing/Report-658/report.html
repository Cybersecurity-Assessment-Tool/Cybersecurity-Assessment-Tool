        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network posture, based on provided organizational data, indicates a foundational understanding of some security practices, such as requiring MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, and conducting annual security awareness training for all employees. An acceptable use policy is also in place. However, critical gaps exist in email security and initial employee onboarding security training.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Email Account Protection - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. Compromised email accounts can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and further lateral movement within the network. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee email accounts</li><li>Email server/service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Untrained New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees upon their onboarding. While annual training is provided, new hires are immediately exposed to potential threats without foundational knowledge of security best practices, phishing recognition, and organizational policies. This increases the likelihood of new employees falling victim to social engineering attacks or inadvertently introducing vulnerabilities. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access. This critical step will significantly reduce the risk of email account compromise. Additionally, a mandatory security awareness training program should be established for all new employees as part of their onboarding process. This training should cover essential security best practices, phishing identification, and the organization's acceptable use policy, ensuring that all personnel are equipped with fundamental security knowledge from day one.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization demonstrates a commitment to security through existing MFA requirements for computers and sensitive data systems, and annual security awareness training, two significant vulnerabilities have been identified. The absence of MFA for email access and the lack of security awareness training for new employees present considerable risks. Addressing these gaps is crucial for bolstering the overall security readiness and resilience against common cyber threats.</p>
