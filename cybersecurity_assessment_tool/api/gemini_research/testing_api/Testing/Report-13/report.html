        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an Nginx web server (version 1.18.0) running on port 443 (HTTPS). Organizational data indicates a lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, although it is used for sensitive data systems. Furthermore, there is no employee acceptable use policy in place, and security awareness training is only conducted for new employees, not annually for all staff.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email and Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email or logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or other means. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's email account or workstation, potentially leading to data breaches, lateral movement within the network, and further compromise. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email systems</li><li>Employee workstations/laptops</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Nginx Web Server - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nginx web server identified on port 443 is running version 1.18.0. This version is significantly outdated and is known to contain several security vulnerabilities that have been patched in newer releases. Running outdated software exposes the organization to known exploits, which attackers can leverage to gain unauthorized access, disrupt services, or compromise the server. For example, CVE-2021-23017 (resolver stack buffer overflow) affected versions up to 1.20.0. This was identified via network port scanning.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Web server (nginx 1.18.0)</li><li>Port 443</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy. An AUP defines the proper and acceptable use of organizational IT resources, including computers, networks, and data. Without such a policy, employees may unknowingly engage in activities that pose security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive information. This absence creates ambiguity regarding expected behavior and makes it difficult to enforce security best practices. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational IT resources</li><li>Data handling procedures</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual training for all employees. Cybersecurity threats evolve rapidly, and regular training is crucial to keep employees informed about new attack vectors (e.g., advanced phishing techniques, social engineering) and reinforce secure behaviors. Without ongoing training, employees are more susceptible to falling victim to attacks, which can lead to credential compromise, malware infections, and data breaches. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li><li>Phishing susceptibility</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and computer logins immediately. Furthermore, the Nginx web server should be updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities and ensure optimal security. The organization must develop and enforce a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy to guide employee behavior regarding IT resource usage. Finally, a program for mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees should be established to ensure continuous education on evolving cyber threats and best practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The current assessment reveals several critical and high-severity vulnerabilities that significantly impact the organization's cybersecurity readiness. Key areas of concern include the lack of comprehensive Multi-Factor Authentication, an outdated web server, and deficiencies in foundational security policies and ongoing employee training. Addressing these issues promptly through the recommended actions is crucial to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and operational disruptions, thereby strengthening the overall security posture.</p>
