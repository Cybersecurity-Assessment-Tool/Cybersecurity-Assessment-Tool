        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network assessment reveals several critical security gaps despite some positive security practices. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for email access and annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees, significant vulnerabilities exist. Specifically, MFA is not required for computer logins or access to sensitive data systems, leaving critical assets exposed to credential-based attacks. Furthermore, the absence of an employee acceptable use policy and a lack of dedicated security awareness training for new employees indicate a need for improved foundational security governance and onboarding processes. Network scans identified an open SSH port (22), which, without proper hardening and the aforementioned MFA controls, presents a significant attack surface.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Authentication for Computer Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for employees to log into their computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised through phishing, malware, or brute-force attacks. Without a second factor, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's workstation and potentially the internal network. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Internal network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Authentication for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk to data confidentiality and integrity. If an attacker gains access to credentials for these systems, they can access, exfiltrate, or tamper with sensitive information without an additional layer of security. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>Cloud storage with sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy (AUP). Without a formal AUP, employees may not be aware of the rules and expectations regarding the use of company IT resources, internet access, email, and data handling. This can lead to increased risks such as data leakage, malware infections from unauthorized software installations or website visits, and non-compliance with regulatory requirements. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Data handling processes</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. While annual training is provided, new hires are particularly vulnerable to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) and may inadvertently introduce security risks due to a lack of understanding of company security policies and best practices from day one. This gap leaves the organization exposed during the critical onboarding period. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Email systems</li><li>Internal network</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed SSH Service - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH (Secure Shell) port (22) was detected on a host within the network. While SSH is a legitimate service for remote administration, an exposed SSH port without robust security measures (e.g., strong passwords, key-based authentication, MFA, IP whitelisting, intrusion detection) is a common target for brute-force attacks and unauthorized access attempts. Given the lack of MFA for computer login, this service could be particularly vulnerable if used for internal system access. This was identified via Nmap scan data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with open port 22</li><li>Remote access infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, the organization should immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and access to sensitive data systems. This is a critical step to prevent unauthorized access even if primary credentials are compromised. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy (AUP) to clearly define expectations for IT resource usage and data handling, ensuring all employees are aware of their responsibilities. Introduce mandatory security awareness training for all new employees as part of their onboarding process, covering essential security best practices and company policies from day one. For the identified open SSH port (22), implement robust security measures including strong, unique key-based authentication, disable password authentication where possible, enforce IP whitelisting, and integrate it with MFA solutions. Regularly review and update all security policies and training programs to adapt to evolving threat landscapes.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In conclusion, while the organization has some security measures in place, such as MFA for email and annual security training, its overall cybersecurity readiness is compromised by several high-severity vulnerabilities. The absence of MFA for computer and sensitive data system access, coupled with gaps in policy enforcement (AUP) and new employee training, creates significant exposure to unauthorized access and data breaches. The presence of an open SSH port further exacerbates these risks. Addressing these critical areas through the recommended implementations will significantly enhance the organization's security posture, reduce its attack surface, and improve its resilience against cyber threats.</p>
