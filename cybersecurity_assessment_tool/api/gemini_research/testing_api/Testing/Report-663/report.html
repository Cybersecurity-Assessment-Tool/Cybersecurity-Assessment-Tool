        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently has an open MySQL port (3306) accessible. Internally, the organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for critical access points such as email, computer logins, or sensitive data systems. While the organization has an acceptable use policy and conducts security awareness training for both new and existing employees annually, the absence of MFA significantly increases the attack surface and potential impact of a breach.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network, potentially exposing the database to unauthorized access. This was identified through network scanning, showing the port in an 'open' state. The impact could range from data exfiltration to unauthorized data manipulation or denial of service if the database is compromised.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted internal IP addresses or specific application servers. For long-term security, consider placing the database behind a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or within a more isolated network segment. Furthermore, the organization must prioritize the implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, including email systems, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, to significantly enhance account security and prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised. Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments should also be conducted to identify and address new risks proactively.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In conclusion, the organization faces significant security risks primarily due to an exposed MySQL database port and a complete lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for critical systems. While security awareness training and an acceptable use policy are in place, these foundational security controls are insufficient to protect against modern threats. Addressing the open database port and implementing MFA are critical immediate steps to improve the organization's overall security posture and readiness against potential cyberattacks.</p>
