        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed a critical exposure: an open port 8080 hosting a service identified as 'TOP SECRET DB'. This indicates a severe risk of sensitive data exposure. Furthermore, the organization exhibits significant weaknesses in its authentication protocols, specifically lacking Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and access to sensitive data systems. While MFA is used for email, these other critical areas remain unprotected. Additionally, there are notable gaps in the organization's security awareness training program, with no training for new employees and no annual training for all staff, leaving the human element vulnerable to social engineering and other attacks. An acceptable use policy is in place.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed Sensitive Database Service - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An Nmap scan identified an open port 8080 exposing a service titled 'TOP SECRET DB'. This represents a critical vulnerability where highly sensitive data or systems could be directly accessible from the network, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data exfiltration, and severe reputational and financial damage. The service was identified by its HTTP title during the network scan.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li><li>TOP SECRET DB service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to internal systems if employee credentials are stolen or compromised through phishing, malware, or other means. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to a user's workstation and potentially facilitate lateral movement within the network. This was identified from organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers</li><li>Network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access sensitive data systems. This critical oversight leaves the organization's most valuable information vulnerable to unauthorized access. If credentials for these systems are compromised, attackers can gain direct access to sensitive data, leading to severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and significant financial and reputational harm. This was identified from organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Critical applications</li></ul>

            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not provide security awareness training for new employees. This leaves new staff members unprepared to identify and respond to common cybersecurity threats such as phishing, social engineering, and malware. Untrained employees are more likely to fall victim to attacks, creating an entry point for adversaries into the organization's network. This was identified from organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Annual Security Awareness Training for All Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. Without regular training, employees' knowledge of evolving threats and best security practices will degrade over time. This increases the overall susceptibility of the organization to human-factor attacks and reduces the effectiveness of security policies and procedures. This was identified from organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediate action is required to address the critical exposure of the 'TOP SECRET DB' service on port 8080. This service must be secured, ideally by removing its public exposure, implementing robust access controls, and segmenting the network. To mitigate authentication weaknesses, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) should be promptly implemented and enforced for all computer logins and access to sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization must establish a comprehensive security awareness training program, including mandatory training for all new employees upon onboarding and annual refresher training for all staff to ensure up-to-date knowledge of cybersecurity threats and best practices. Regular review and updates of security policies and procedures are also recommended.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several critical and high-severity cybersecurity risks. The direct exposure of a 'TOP SECRET DB' service, coupled with the absence of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, creates significant vulnerabilities for data breaches and unauthorized access. The lack of comprehensive and recurring security awareness training further exacerbates these risks by leaving employees unprepared for modern threats. While an acceptable use policy is in place, the overall security posture indicates a low state of readiness against sophisticated attacks. Urgent and decisive action is necessary to implement the recommended security controls and training programs to protect the organization's assets and data.</p>
