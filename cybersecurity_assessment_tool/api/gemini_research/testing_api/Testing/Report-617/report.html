        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) port (3389), indicating direct exposure to the internet. This is a significant security concern. Furthermore, the organization currently does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access or computer logins, although MFA is used for sensitive data systems. There is no employee acceptable use policy in place, and while new employees receive security awareness training, annual training for all employees is not conducted. These factors collectively point to several critical vulnerabilities and gaps in the organization's security posture.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>RDP Exposure - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed to the internet, as identified by an open port 3389 during a network scan. This exposure presents a critical risk, as it allows external attackers to potentially enumerate user accounts, attempt brute-force attacks against login credentials, or exploit known vulnerabilities in the RDP service. Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to internal systems, data exfiltration, or even full system compromise, severely impacting business operations and data confidentiality.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>System with open port 3389</li><li>RDP Service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email and Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email or logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are compromised through phishing, malware, or other means. Without a second factor of authentication, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's email and workstation, leading to data breaches, lateral movement within the network, and business email compromise. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email systems</li><li>Employee workstations</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines on appropriate use of company IT resources, employees may inadvertently engage in risky behaviors, such as visiting malicious websites, downloading unauthorized software, or mishandling sensitive data. This increases the likelihood of malware infections, data leaks, and non-compliance with security best practices, creating a less secure environment. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee workstations</li><li>Organizational data and systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This means that existing employees may not be up-to-date on the latest threats, best practices, or organizational policies. A lack of continuous training can lead to a decline in security vigilance, making employees more susceptible to social engineering attacks, phishing attempts, and other human-factor vulnerabilities, thereby increasing overall organizational risk. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data and systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately close the exposed RDP port (3389) and implement secure remote access solutions, such as a Virtual Private Network (VPN) with strong authentication. Furthermore, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) should be mandated for all email access and computer logins to significantly enhance credential security. The organization must develop and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to clearly define expected behavior regarding IT resource usage. Finally, a robust and recurring security awareness training program should be established for all employees, conducted at least annually, to ensure continuous education on current threats and best practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces critical vulnerabilities due to an exposed RDP service and significant gaps in its security posture, including the absence of MFA for key access points, a lack of an acceptable use policy, and insufficient ongoing security awareness training. While MFA is utilized for sensitive data systems and new employees receive initial training, these measures are not comprehensive enough to protect against prevalent cyber threats. Addressing these issues is paramount to improving the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and reducing its attack surface.</p>
