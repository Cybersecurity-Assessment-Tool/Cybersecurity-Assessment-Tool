        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan indicates a host is active, with port 80 identified as closed. However, a specific risk assessment highlighted the presence of an unencrypted web server. A review of organizational practices reveals a critical lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA) for email access, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. Additionally, the organization does not have an employee acceptable use policy in place. On a positive note, the organization does conduct security awareness training for new employees and provides annual training for all employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unencrypted Web Server - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Port 80 is open, indicating an unencrypted web server. This allows for unencrypted communication, making any data transmitted over this port vulnerable to interception and eavesdropping by malicious actors. The presence of this unencrypted service was identified through a risk assessment.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately close port 80 if it is not intended for use. For any legitimate web services, implement SSL/TLS encryption to secure all web traffic, redirecting all HTTP traffic to HTTPS. Furthermore, the organization must implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, to significantly enhance access security and prevent unauthorized access. Developing and enforcing a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy is crucial for establishing clear guidelines on technology usage, data handling, and security best practices, thereby reducing insider risks and improving overall compliance.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently exhibits significant cybersecurity vulnerabilities, primarily stemming from the absence of multi-factor authentication across critical systems and the lack of an employee acceptable use policy. While security awareness training is a positive step, these foundational security controls are critical gaps. The identified unencrypted web server (if active) presents a direct risk of data interception. Addressing these vulnerabilities is paramount to improving the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and readiness against potential threats, moving towards a more secure and resilient operational environment.</p>
