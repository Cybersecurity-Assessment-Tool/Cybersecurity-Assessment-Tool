        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open port 8080 hosting a service explicitly titled 'TOP SECRET DB', indicating a critical exposure of sensitive data. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is used for email access, it is notably absent for computer logins and access to sensitive data systems, which poses a significant risk. Furthermore, the organization lacks essential security awareness training for both new and existing employees, leaving the human element vulnerable to social engineering and other threats. An acceptable use policy is in place, which is a positive step, but the identified technical and procedural gaps severely undermine the overall security posture.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed Sensitive Database - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A network scan identified port 8080 as open, hosting a service with the title 'TOP SECRET DB'. This indicates that a database containing highly sensitive information is directly accessible on the network, potentially without adequate authentication or access controls. This exposure presents a critical risk for data exfiltration, unauthorized access, and potential compromise of confidential information. The previous assessment incorrectly marked this as secure, but the scan data clearly shows a severe vulnerability.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li><li>Service 'TOP SECRET DB'</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly weakens endpoint security, making systems highly susceptible to unauthorized access if employee credentials are compromised through phishing, keyloggers, or brute-force attacks. A single compromised password could grant an attacker access to internal resources.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers</li><li>Network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access sensitive data systems. Given the presence of an exposed 'TOP SECRET DB', this is an extremely critical vulnerability. Without MFA, a compromised single factor (e.g., password) is sufficient to gain unauthorized access to the most critical organizational data, leading to severe data breaches and regulatory non-compliance.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems (e.g., 'TOP SECRET DB')</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training upon joining the organization. This leaves them unprepared to identify and respond to common cybersecurity threats such as phishing, malware, and social engineering attacks. Untrained employees are a significant weak point in the security chain, increasing the likelihood of accidental data breaches or system compromises.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network security</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Annual Security Awareness Training for All Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. Regular training is essential to keep employees updated on evolving cyber threats, reinforce security best practices, and maintain a strong security culture. Without ongoing education, employees' security knowledge can become outdated, making them more vulnerable to sophisticated attacks.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network security</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediate action is required to address the critical vulnerabilities identified. Firstly, the 'TOP SECRET DB' exposed on port 8080 must be secured immediately. This involves implementing robust firewall rules to restrict access, deploying strong authentication mechanisms, and ensuring proper access controls are in place. Secondly, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) should be mandated for all computer logins and, most critically, for access to all sensitive data systems. This will significantly enhance protection against credential compromise. Thirdly, a comprehensive security awareness training program must be established. This program should include mandatory training for all new employees during onboarding and annual refresher training for all existing employees to ensure continuous education on current threats and best practices. Regular reviews of security policies and configurations are also recommended to maintain a strong security posture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks, primarily due to an exposed sensitive database, a widespread lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for critical access points, and a complete absence of security awareness training for its workforce. While an acceptable use policy is in place, the identified technical and human-factor vulnerabilities indicate a low state of readiness against modern cyber threats. Urgent and comprehensive measures are necessary to mitigate these risks and establish a more robust security posture to protect sensitive data and organizational assets.</p>
