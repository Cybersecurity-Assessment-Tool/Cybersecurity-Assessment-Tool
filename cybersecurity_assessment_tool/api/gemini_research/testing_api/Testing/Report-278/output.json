                "Summary": "The organization's network includes an FTP server running vsftpd 2.3.4 with anonymous login enabled. Internally, workstations are running outdated Windows 7. The organization requires Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and sensitive data systems but not for email access. While an acceptable use policy is in place and annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees, new employees do not receive initial security awareness training.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Outdated Windows Policy",
                        "Overview": "Computers are running Windows 7. This operating system is end-of-life and no longer receives security updates, making systems highly vulnerable to known exploits and malware. Continued use of Windows 7 poses a critical risk to data integrity and system availability.",

                        "Risk": "Anonymous FTP Login Allowed",
                        "Overview": "The FTP server (vsftpd 2.3.4) allows anonymous login. This configuration can lead to unauthorized access to files, data leakage, or even server compromise if write permissions are misconfigured. This vulnerability was identified via an Nmap scan showing 'ftp-anon' script output indicating anonymous login is allowed.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                    {
                        "Risk": "No MFA for Email Access",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks, as a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to an employee's email, leading to data breaches and business email compromise (BEC) scenarios.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                    {
                        "Risk": "No Security Awareness Training for New Employees",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees during their onboarding process. This leaves new hires vulnerable to social engineering attacks, phishing, and other common threats due to a lack of understanding of organizational security policies and best practices, potentially making them an easy target for attackers.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "New employees",
                            "Organizational security posture"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately upgrade all workstations running Windows 7 to a currently supported operating system (e.g., Windows 10 or 11) and develop a hardware refresh plan if necessary. The FTP server should be reconfigured to disable anonymous login; if anonymous access is essential, ensure strict read-only permissions and restrict access to non-sensitive directories, or consider migrating to a more secure file transfer solution like SFTP. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be mandated for all email access to significantly reduce account compromise risks. Furthermore, a mandatory security awareness training program should be implemented for all new employees during their onboarding to educate them on organizational security policies and best practices. Regular patching and updates for all network services, operating systems, and applications should also be enforced.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces several critical and high-severity cybersecurity risks, primarily due to the continued use of an end-of-life operating system (Windows 7), an insecurely configured FTP server allowing anonymous access, and a lack of MFA for email. While some foundational security measures are in place, such as MFA for computer logins and annual security training for existing staff, the absence of initial security training for new employees and the critical technical vulnerabilities significantly weaken the overall security posture. Addressing these identified risks promptly is paramount to enhance the organization's resilience against evolving cyber threats and protect sensitive data."
