        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>A comprehensive technical network assessment is not possible at this time due to broken network scan data. However, an analysis of the provided organizational data reveals significant gaps in fundamental security policies and practices. The organization currently lacks multi-factor authentication (MFA) across critical access points, an acceptable use policy for employees, and essential security awareness training programs. These deficiencies indicate a low level of organizational readiness against common cyber threats, relying heavily on single-factor authentication and lacking a structured approach to employee security behavior.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. Compromised email accounts can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and further internal network penetration. This was identified directly from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>User accounts</li><li>Employee workstations</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This leaves workstations and potentially the internal network vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are stolen or guessed. An attacker gaining access to a computer could escalate privileges, deploy malware, or access sensitive data. This was identified directly from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network access points</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This is a critical vulnerability, as it means that a single compromised credential could grant an attacker direct access to the organization's most valuable and protected information. The impact could include severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and significant reputational damage. This was identified directly from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>Cloud storage</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy (AUP). Without a formal AUP, employees may not be aware of their responsibilities regarding the use of company IT resources, data handling, and internet usage. This can lead to increased risks from insider threats, misuse of company assets, data leakage, and exposure to malware through unapproved activities. This was identified directly from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>IT systems</li><li>Data assets</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering attacks and may inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities due to a lack of understanding of organizational security protocols and common threats. This increases the risk of phishing success, malware infections, and policy violations from the outset of employment. This was identified directly from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Annual Security Awareness Training for All Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. Regular training is crucial to keep employees informed about evolving threats, reinforce security best practices, and maintain a strong human firewall. The absence of annual training leads to a decay in security knowledge, making employees more susceptible to sophisticated social engineering attacks and less likely to identify and report suspicious activities. This was identified directly from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, the organization should immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, including email, computer logins, and especially sensitive data systems. This is the most impactful step to prevent unauthorized access from compromised credentials. Concurrently, a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) must be developed and formally communicated to all staff to establish clear guidelines for IT resource usage and data handling. Furthermore, a robust security awareness training program is essential. This program should include mandatory training for all new employees upon onboarding and annual refresher training for all existing staff to ensure continuous education on current threats and best practices. These foundational controls will significantly enhance the organization's security posture and reduce human-centric vulnerabilities.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently exhibits a low level of cybersecurity readiness, primarily due to critical gaps in fundamental security policies and employee training. The absence of Multi-Factor Authentication across email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, combined with the lack of an Acceptable Use Policy and comprehensive security awareness training, exposes the organization to a high risk of credential compromise, unauthorized access, and data breaches. Addressing these foundational vulnerabilities through the immediate implementation of MFA and a structured security awareness program is paramount to establishing a more resilient defense against prevalent cyber threats.</p>
