        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The network scan indicates a well-secured perimeter with no open ports detected, suggesting a robust firewall configuration or minimal exposed services. However, the organization's internal security posture reveals critical weaknesses, particularly concerning multi-factor authentication (MFA) and ongoing security awareness training. While an acceptable use policy is in place and new employees receive initial training, the absence of MFA for email and computer logins, coupled with a lack of annual security awareness training for all employees, significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access and successful phishing attacks.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This means that if an attacker obtains an employee's email credentials (e.g., through phishing or credential stuffing), they can gain full access to their email account without any additional verification. This can lead to business email compromise, data exfiltration, and further internal network penetration. Identified via organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>All employee email accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for logging into computers within the organization. This leaves computer systems vulnerable to credential theft attacks. If an attacker compromises a user's login credentials, they can gain unauthorized access to the computer, potentially leading to lateral movement within the network, data access, and malware deployment. Identified via organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All organizational computers</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. While new employees receive initial training, the lack of regular, recurring training means employees may not be updated on the latest threats, best practices, or organizational policies. This increases the likelihood of employees falling victim to social engineering attacks, phishing, or making security-related errors, thereby weakening the human firewall. Identified via organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network security</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points. Specifically, MFA should be mandated for email access and computer logins to prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised. Furthermore, a comprehensive and mandatory annual security awareness training program should be established for all employees. This training should cover current threat landscapes, phishing recognition, strong password practices, and incident reporting procedures to continuously educate and empower employees as the first line of defense. Regular policy reviews and updates should also be conducted to ensure alignment with evolving security standards.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the external network perimeter appears robust with no immediately exploitable open ports detected, the organization faces significant internal security risks primarily due to the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for email and computer access, and a lack of consistent, annual security awareness training for all employees. These gaps create substantial vulnerabilities to credential-based attacks and social engineering. Addressing these human and access control weaknesses is paramount to improving the overall cybersecurity readiness and resilience against modern threats.</p>
