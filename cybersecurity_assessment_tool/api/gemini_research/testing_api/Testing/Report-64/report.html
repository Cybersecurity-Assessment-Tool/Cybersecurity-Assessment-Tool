        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The network scan indicated no open ports on the scanned hosts, suggesting a basic level of external network hardening. However, a review of organizational security policies revealed significant gaps in foundational security practices. The organization currently lacks critical multi-factor authentication enforcement across email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, there is an absence of an employee acceptable use policy and no structured security awareness training for either new or existing employees. These policy and training deficiencies represent substantial human-factor and access control vulnerabilities that could be exploited despite a seemingly closed network perimeter.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts, even if passwords are compromised. A successful compromise could lead to phishing attacks, data exfiltration, and business email compromise (BEC) scams. Identified via organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if user credentials are stolen or guessed, potentially leading to lateral movement within the network and access to sensitive data. Identified via organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers</li><li>Network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This is a critical vulnerability as it means a single compromised password could grant an attacker direct access to the organization's most valuable and confidential information, leading to severe data breaches and regulatory non-compliance. Identified via organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>Cloud storage</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This means there are no formal guidelines for employees regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, internet, and email. This can lead to increased risks from misuse, unauthorized software installations, data leakage, and legal liabilities due to employee actions. Identified via organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>IT infrastructure</li><li>Data assets</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not provide security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) as they may be less familiar with company security protocols and common threats. This increases the risk of human error leading to security incidents. Identified via organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. Regular training is crucial to keep employees informed about evolving threats, reinforce best practices, and maintain a strong security culture. Without it, employees are more susceptible to sophisticated attacks like phishing, ransomware, and social engineering. Identified via organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, including email systems, computer logins, and especially sensitive data systems, as a top priority. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to guide appropriate behavior regarding IT resources. Establish and regularly conduct mandatory security awareness training for all employees, starting with new hires and followed by annual refreshers for the entire workforce, to educate them on current threats and best security practices. Additionally, consider regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing to identify and address technical weaknesses proactively.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to a lack of fundamental security policies and employee training, despite a network scan showing no immediately exploitable open ports. The absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for critical systems and the lack of security awareness programs create a high susceptibility to social engineering, credential theft, and unauthorized access. Addressing these policy and human-factor vulnerabilities is paramount to improving the overall security readiness and protecting against potential data breaches and operational disruptions.</p>
