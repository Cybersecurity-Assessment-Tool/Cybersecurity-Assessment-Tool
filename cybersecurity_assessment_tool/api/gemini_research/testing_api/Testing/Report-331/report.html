        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open SSH port (22), which, while a standard service, requires careful hardening to prevent unauthorized access. From an organizational standpoint, while Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is utilized for email and sensitive data systems, it is notably absent for computer logins. Furthermore, the organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy and does not provide security awareness training for new employees upon onboarding, although annual training is conducted for all staff. These gaps indicate a moderate level of readiness with specific areas requiring immediate attention to mitigate significant risks.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port (22) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH port (22) was detected during the network scan. While SSH is a legitimate and necessary service for remote administration, if not properly secured (e.g., weak passwords, password authentication enabled, no rate limiting, outdated software), it can serve as a significant attack vector. Attackers could exploit misconfigurations or vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access, execute commands, or exfiltrate data. The current scan only indicates the port is open, not its specific configuration or hardening status.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Network perimeter</li><li>SSH service on host(s)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to internal systems. If an attacker obtains a user's credentials through phishing, malware, or other means, they can gain direct access to the user's workstation and potentially the internal network without needing a second verification factor. This vulnerability makes the organization highly susceptible to credential-based attacks and lateral movement within the network.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee workstations</li><li>Internal network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines on the appropriate and inappropriate use of company IT resources (e.g., internet, email, software, hardware), employees may inadvertently engage in risky behaviors. This can include visiting malicious websites, downloading unauthorized software, sharing sensitive information inappropriately, or using personal devices without proper security controls. This absence increases the likelihood of malware infections, data breaches, and compliance violations due to inconsistent employee conduct.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Data integrity and confidentiality</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees as part of their onboarding process. While annual training is provided, new hires are often unfamiliar with the company's specific security policies, common threats (like phishing and social engineering), and best practices during their initial employment period. This gap leaves the organization exposed to human-factor risks, as new employees are particularly vulnerable to targeted attacks until they receive the comprehensive annual training.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Email systems</li><li>Internal network access</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately review and harden all SSH configurations, disabling password authentication in favor of key-based authentication, implementing strong access controls, and ensuring all SSH software is up-to-date. A critical priority should be the implementation and enforcement of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins across the organization to significantly reduce the risk of credential-based attacks. Furthermore, the organization must develop and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy, ensuring all employees are trained on its contents and acknowledge compliance. Finally, a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees should be established as part of their onboarding process, covering common threats and company policies from day one, supplementing the existing annual training.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently exhibits a mixed security posture. While foundational security measures like MFA for email and sensitive data, along with annual security training, are in place, significant vulnerabilities exist. The open SSH port requires immediate hardening, and the absence of MFA for computer logins presents a critical risk for unauthorized access. The lack of an acceptable use policy and immediate security awareness training for new hires further exposes the organization to human-factor risks and potential policy violations. Addressing these identified gaps is crucial for enhancing the organization's overall security posture and improving its readiness against prevalent cyber threats.</p>
