        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed a single active host with port 8080 open, exposing a service titled 'TOP SECRET DB'. This indicates a critical exposure of potentially sensitive data or applications. From an organizational security posture perspective, the company has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and sensitive data systems, which is a positive step. However, a significant gap exists as MFA is not required for email access. Furthermore, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy, which can lead to inconsistent security practices and increased risk of misuse of IT resources. While security awareness training is conducted for new and existing employees annually, the absence of an AUP and the email MFA gap are notable weaknesses.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed 'TOP SECRET DB' Service on Port 8080 - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open port 8080 was identified on an active host, exposing a service with the HTTP title 'TOP SECRET DB'. This direct exposure of a service explicitly labeled 'TOP SECRET DB' on an open port represents a critical security vulnerability. It suggests that highly sensitive information or a critical application may be directly accessible from the network, potentially without adequate authentication or authorization, leading to a severe risk of unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or system compromise. The vulnerability was identified via an Nmap scan using the 'http-title' script.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li><li>Service with HTTP title 'TOP SECRET DB'</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing employee email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of email account compromise through common attack vectors such as phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks. A compromised email account can lead to business email compromise (BEC), unauthorized access to sensitive communications, data leakage, and further lateral movement within the organization's network. This vulnerability was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee email accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently does not have an established employee acceptable use policy. The lack of a formal AUP means there are no clear, documented guidelines for employees regarding the proper and secure use of company IT resources, internet access, email, and handling of sensitive data. This absence can lead to inconsistent security practices, increased risk of data misuse, unauthorized software installations, and potential legal or compliance issues. This vulnerability was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Organizational policy</li><li>Employee behavior</li><li>IT resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediate action is required to address the critical exposure on port 8080. The 'TOP SECRET DB' service must be immediately secured, either by implementing robust access controls, placing it behind a firewall with strict rules, or moving it to an isolated internal network segment. If the service is not intended to be publicly accessible, it should be shut down or its access restricted. Furthermore, it is strongly recommended to implement mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts to significantly reduce the risk of account compromise. The organization should also develop, disseminate, and enforce a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) to provide clear guidelines for secure IT resource usage and data handling. Regular security awareness training should continue to reinforce these policies and best practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization faces a critical security risk due to an exposed 'TOP SECRET DB' service on port 8080, which demands immediate remediation. Additionally, the absence of MFA for email access and a formal acceptable use policy represent significant vulnerabilities that could lead to data breaches and operational disruptions. While the organization has positive security practices in place for MFA on sensitive systems and regular security awareness training, these critical gaps undermine the overall security posture and readiness. Addressing these identified risks is paramount to enhancing the organization's cybersecurity defenses and protecting its sensitive assets.</p>
