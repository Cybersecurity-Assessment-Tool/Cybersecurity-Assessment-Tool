        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization operates an active network host with an open web port (HTTP), indicating a potential web service. While an employee acceptable use policy is in place and annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees, significant security gaps exist. Specifically, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for email access or computer logins, leaving these critical access points vulnerable to credential-based attacks. Although MFA is enforced for sensitive data systems, the lack of it for daily operations poses a substantial risk. Furthermore, there is no dedicated security awareness training for new employees, which could lead to early security missteps.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Email accounts are a primary target for phishing and credential stuffing attacks. Without Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), compromised email credentials can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive communications, data, and potential lateral movement within the network. This vulnerability was identified by reviewing the organization's security policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Direct access to computers without Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if user credentials are stolen or guessed. This can lead to system compromise, data exfiltration, and the propagation of malware. This vulnerability was identified by reviewing the organization's security policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee workstations</li><li>Network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate New Employee Security Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees are often unfamiliar with an organization's specific security policies, common threats (such as phishing), and best practices. A lack of initial, mandatory security awareness training leaves new hires vulnerable to social engineering attacks and increases the likelihood of accidental security incidents. This vulnerability was identified by reviewing the organization's security training policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open Web Port (HTTP) - <span class="severity-Info">Info</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open port 80 indicates an active web server, potentially exposing the organization to web-based attacks if the server or the application running on it is not properly secured, patched, or configured. While not a vulnerability in itself without further context, it represents an attack surface that requires careful management. This was identified via network scan.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Web Server (Port 80)</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, starting with email systems and computer logins. This will significantly enhance protection against credential theft. Furthermore, a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees should be established to ensure they are equipped with essential security knowledge from day one. The existing annual security awareness training should continue, and the employee acceptable use policy should be regularly reinforced. Finally, a thorough review and hardening of the web server operating on port 80 should be conducted to ensure it is securely configured, patched, and running only necessary services.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to cybersecurity through its acceptable use policy and annual security awareness training. However, critical vulnerabilities exist due to the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for email and computer logins, and a gap in security awareness training for new hires. These areas represent significant risks that could be exploited by malicious actors. Addressing these key vulnerabilities is paramount to enhancing the organization's overall security posture and readiness against evolving cyber threats.</p>
