        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization currently lacks multi-factor authentication (MFA) for email access and computer logins, which significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access. While MFA is used for sensitive data systems, its absence in other critical areas is a major concern. Furthermore, the organization does not have an employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees, indicating gaps in foundational security practices. A network scan identified an open SSH port (22), which could be a potential entry point if not properly secured.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for email access. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. If an attacker gains access to an employee's email, they could potentially launch further attacks, impersonate the employee, or access sensitive information. This was identified from the 'Do you require MFA to access email?' question in the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for logging into computers. This leaves employee workstations vulnerable to unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or guessed. Compromised workstations can lead to lateral movement within the network, data exfiltration, and malware deployment. This was identified from the 'Do you require MFA to log into computers?' question in the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines, employees may engage in activities that inadvertently introduce security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling company data. This increases the likelihood of security incidents and makes it difficult to enforce security best practices. This was identified from the 'Does your organization have an employee acceptable use policy?' question in the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual training for all employees. This means that existing employees may not be updated on the latest threats, best practices, or organizational policies, leading to a degradation of security posture over time. A lack of continuous training increases susceptibility to social engineering attacks and other human-factor vulnerabilities. This was identified from the 'Does your organization do security awareness training for all employees at least once per year?' question in the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network security</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port (22) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A network scan revealed that port 22 (SSH) is open. While SSH is a legitimate service, an open port presents a potential attack surface for brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or exploitation of SSH vulnerabilities if not properly secured (e.g., strong passwords, key-based authentication, MFA, IP restrictions). This was identified from the Nmap scan data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Network perimeter</li><li>Servers/devices listening on port 22</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediately implement multi-factor authentication for all email accounts and computer logins to significantly enhance protection against credential theft and unauthorized access. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy that clearly outlines expectations for technology usage, data handling, and security best practices. Establish a program for mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees, covering current threats, phishing recognition, data protection, and policy updates. Review and secure all systems with an open SSH port (22), ensuring strong, unique passwords or, preferably, key-based authentication is used. Implement IP whitelisting, disable root login, and consider using a jump box or VPN for SSH access. Regularly patch SSH servers to mitigate known vulnerabilities.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently exhibits several critical security gaps, primarily concerning the lack of multi-factor authentication for email and computer logins, which poses a high risk of unauthorized access. Furthermore, the absence of an acceptable use policy and annual security awareness training indicates a need for stronger foundational security practices. The presence of an open SSH port also warrants immediate attention. Addressing these vulnerabilities through the recommended actions is crucial to significantly improve the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and readiness against common threats.</p>
