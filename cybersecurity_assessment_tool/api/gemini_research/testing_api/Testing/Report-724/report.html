        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The network scan data indicates that the target host is operational, but no open ports were identified, and all extra ports are reported as closed. This suggests a potentially well-hardened external perimeter with no publicly exposed services, or a limited scope of the scan. From an external perspective, the network presents a minimal attack surface. However, internal organizational data reveals several critical areas of concern regarding security policies and practices.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Email Authentication - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts through phishing, brute-force attacks, or compromised credentials. A successful breach could lead to data exfiltration, business email compromise (BEC) scams, and further lateral movement within the network. This vulnerability was identified through a review of organizational security policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li><li>Sensitive communications</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Computer Login Authentication - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are stolen or guessed. Attackers could gain access to internal systems, sensitive data, and potentially deploy malware or ransomware. This vulnerability was identified through a review of organizational security policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Servers</li><li>Network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Missing Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy (AUP). Without a formal AUP, employees may be unaware of their responsibilities regarding the use of company IT resources, leading to potential misuse, unauthorized software installations, or risky online behavior. This increases the likelihood of security incidents and compliance violations. This vulnerability was identified through a review of organizational policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Organizational compliance</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This means employees may not be updated on the latest threats, best practices, or changes in company policy, leading to a degradation of security posture over time. Human error remains a significant factor in security breaches. This vulnerability was identified through a review of organizational training programs.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security culture</li><li>Susceptibility to social engineering</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and computer logins. This will significantly enhance protection against credential-based attacks. Furthermore, a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy (AUP) should be developed, communicated, and enforced to establish clear guidelines for IT resource usage. Finally, a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees must be established to ensure ongoing education on current threats and best practices, thereby strengthening the human element of security.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the external network perimeter appears to be well-secured with no immediately apparent open ports, the organization's internal security posture is significantly weakened by critical policy and training gaps. The absence of MFA for email and computer logins, coupled with the lack of an acceptable use policy and annual security awareness training, exposes the organization to a high risk of internal breaches, data loss, and compliance issues. Addressing these fundamental vulnerabilities is paramount to improving overall cybersecurity readiness.</p>
