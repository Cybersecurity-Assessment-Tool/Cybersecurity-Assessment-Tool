        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization operates a network that includes a system accessible via port 8080, which was identified as 'TOP SECRET DB' but later assessed as secure. The organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems and maintains an acceptable use policy and annual security awareness training for all employees. However, a critical gap exists in the lack of MFA for computer logins and the absence of security awareness training for new employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Port 8080 Secured - <span class="severity-Info">Info</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Port 8080 is confirmed secure and false positive. Although an initial scan identified a service titled 'TOP SECRET DB' on this port, further assessment determined it does not pose a security risk.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication, making endpoints vulnerable to brute-force or credential stuffing attacks.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers</li><li>Login authentication systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient New Employee Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. This leaves new hires vulnerable to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) and unaware of critical security policies and best practices from the start, increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents before they receive annual training.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to enhance endpoint security and prevent unauthorized access even if passwords are compromised. Additionally, a comprehensive security awareness training program should be established for all new employees, ideally as part of their onboarding process, to ensure they are immediately aware of security policies, best practices, and common threats like phishing. While port 8080 has been deemed secure, continuous monitoring of all open ports is advised as part of a robust vulnerability management program.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to cybersecurity through MFA for critical systems, an acceptable use policy, and annual security awareness training. However, the absence of MFA for computer logins and initial security training for new hires represents significant vulnerabilities that could be exploited. Addressing these gaps is crucial for strengthening the overall security posture, reducing the risk of successful cyberattacks, and fostering a more secure operational environment.</p>
