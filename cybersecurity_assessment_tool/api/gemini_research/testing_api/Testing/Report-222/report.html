        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan indicates that port 80 is closed. However, a specific vulnerability assessment highlights an unencrypted web server, suggesting potential misconfiguration or exposure of unencrypted traffic. From an organizational security posture, the company currently lacks multi-factor authentication (MFA) for email access, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, significantly increasing the risk of unauthorized access through compromised credentials. Furthermore, there is no employee acceptable use policy in place. Positively, the organization does conduct security awareness training for both new and existing employees annually.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unencrypted Web Server - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Port 80 is open, exposing web traffic without encryption. This allows attackers to intercept sensitive information transmitted over the network, such as login credentials or personal data, leading to data breaches and privacy violations. This was identified through a vulnerability assessment.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for email access, computer logins, or sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or guessed, as a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to critical systems and data. This was identified through an organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email access</li><li>Computer logins</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This absence can lead to employees engaging in risky online behaviors, misusing company resources, or inadvertently introducing security threats due to a lack of clear guidelines on appropriate conduct and system usage. This was identified through an organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee conduct</li><li>Company resources</li><li>Overall security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, to significantly enhance protection against credential theft. For the unencrypted web server, the immediate fix is to close port 80 if it's not intended for public access, or to implement SSL/TLS encryption to secure all web traffic. Furthermore, developing and enforcing a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy is crucial to establish clear guidelines for secure behavior and resource utilization. While security awareness training is already in place, it should be updated to emphasize the importance of MFA and adherence to the new acceptable use policy.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant security vulnerabilities primarily due to the absence of multi-factor authentication across critical systems and the lack of an employee acceptable use policy. While security awareness training is a positive step, these fundamental gaps expose the organization to a high risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Addressing these issues, alongside securing any unencrypted web services, is paramount to improving the overall cybersecurity posture and readiness.</p>
