        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes a service on port 8080 titled "TOP SECRET DB", indicating a potentially sensitive database is accessible. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for computer logins and sensitive data systems, it is notably absent for email access. Furthermore, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not provide security awareness training specifically for new employees, although annual training is conducted for all staff.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed Sensitive Database - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open port 8080 was identified, hosting a service with the title "TOP SECRET DB". This indicates that a potentially highly sensitive database or application is directly accessible, possibly without adequate authentication or encryption, leading to a critical risk of data breach, unauthorized access, or information disclosure. This was identified via an Nmap scan using the http-title script.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li><li>Service with title "TOP SECRET DB"</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing, as a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to an employee's email communications. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee email accounts</li><li>Email infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without a clear AUP, employees may be unaware of their responsibilities regarding the use of company IT resources, data handling, and internet usage, leading to increased risks of data leakage, malware infections, and non-compliance with security best practices. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>IT systems</li><li>Data handling procedures</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive dedicated security awareness training upon joining the organization. This leaves new hires vulnerable to social engineering attacks, phishing attempts, and other common cybersecurity threats during their initial period, potentially exposing the organization to risks before they receive annual training. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately investigate and secure the service exposed on port 8080, especially given its "TOP SECRET DB" title. This should involve restricting access, implementing strong authentication, and ensuring data encryption. Furthermore, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) should be promptly implemented for all email access to enhance account security. The organization must develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to clearly define expected behavior and responsibilities regarding IT resource usage. Finally, a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees should be established to ensure they are equipped with essential cybersecurity knowledge from day one, complementing the existing annual training for all staff.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization faces significant cybersecurity challenges, primarily stemming from an exposed sensitive database and critical gaps in its security policies and training programs. While some MFA measures are in place, the lack of MFA for email, absence of an acceptable use policy, and insufficient initial security training for new employees create substantial vulnerabilities. Addressing these issues with urgency is crucial to prevent potential data breaches, maintain data integrity, and foster a more robust security posture.</p>
