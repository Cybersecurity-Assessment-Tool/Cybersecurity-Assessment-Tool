        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to foundational security practices, including multi-factor authentication for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, as well as an acceptable use policy and security awareness training for new employees. However, a recent network scan identified an open RDP port (3389), indicating a potential external attack surface. Additionally, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees, which could lead to a degradation of security posture over time.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>RDP Exposure - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed to the internet via an open port (3389). This allows external attackers to potentially attempt brute-force attacks or exploit vulnerabilities in the RDP service to gain unauthorized access to internal systems. This was identified through a network scan showing port 3389 as open.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP address with open port 3389</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. This oversight can lead to a decline in employee vigilance regarding phishing attempts, social engineering, and other common cyber threats, increasing the risk of human error-induced security breaches. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately close port 3389 to the internet, thereby eliminating direct RDP exposure. For remote access, implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution that requires strong authentication, preferably multi-factor authentication, before allowing RDP connections to internal resources. Furthermore, to address the gap in employee training, the organization should establish and enforce a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees to ensure ongoing vigilance against evolving cyber threats and to reinforce best practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization has a solid foundation with MFA implementation and initial security training. However, the critical vulnerability of an exposed RDP port significantly elevates the risk of unauthorized access. Coupled with the lack of annual security awareness training, there's a clear need for immediate remediation of the RDP exposure and a structured approach to continuous employee education to maintain and improve the overall security posture.</p>
