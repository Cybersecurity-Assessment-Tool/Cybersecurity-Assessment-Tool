        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's current security posture, based on available organizational data, indicates significant foundational weaknesses, particularly concerning access controls and employee security practices. While specific network scan data and detailed vulnerability reports were unavailable for analysis, the existing policies suggest a high susceptibility to common cyber threats. The organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for critical access points and lacks a comprehensive acceptable use policy, which are fundamental elements of a robust security framework. Security awareness training is provided to new employees but is not conducted annually for all staff, leaving a gap in ongoing threat education.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Email Account Compromise - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of email account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. A compromised email account can lead to data breaches, business email compromise (BEC) scams, and unauthorized access to other linked services. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational policy data indicating no MFA requirement for email.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>All employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unauthorized System Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for logging into computers. This leaves systems vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are stolen or guessed. Attackers could gain access to internal networks, sensitive data, and critical infrastructure, potentially leading to further lateral movement and system compromise. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational policy data indicating no MFA requirement for computer logins.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee workstations</li><li>Servers</li><li>Network devices requiring login</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Sensitive Data Breach - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce MFA for access to sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk for data breaches, as a single compromised password could grant an attacker access to highly confidential information. Such a breach could result in severe regulatory fines, significant reputational damage, and substantial financial loss. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational policy data indicating no MFA requirement for sensitive data systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All sensitive data systems (e.g., CRM, ERP, HR systems, financial databases)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Employee Misconduct & Data Leakage - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines, employees may unknowingly or intentionally engage in activities that pose security risks, such as using company resources for unauthorized purposes, installing unapproved software, or mishandling sensitive data. This absence increases the likelihood of data leakage, malware infections, and compliance violations. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational policy data indicating no acceptable use policy.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT assets</li><li>Sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Human Factor Vulnerability - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual training for all employees. This means employees may not be updated on the latest threats, best practices, or changes in company policy, leading to a degradation of security posture over time. Employees remain a primary target for social engineering and phishing attacks, and a lack of ongoing training exacerbates this risk. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational policy data regarding security awareness training frequency.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implements Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, including email systems, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy must be developed, communicated, and enforced to establish clear guidelines for technology usage and data handling. An annual, mandatory security awareness training program for all employees should be established to ensure ongoing education on evolving cyber threats and best practices. Regular reviews of security policies and controls are also advised to maintain an adaptive and resilient security posture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to a lack of fundamental security controls and policies. The absence of MFA for critical access points, the lack of an acceptable use policy, and insufficient recurring security awareness training create substantial vulnerabilities that could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and operational disruptions. The organization's readiness is currently low, and immediate action is required to implement foundational security measures to protect its assets and data from prevalent cyber threats.</p>
