                "Summary": "The organization's network includes at least one active host running an FTP service (vsftpd 2.3.4) on port 21, which currently allows anonymous login. Internally, the organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access or computer logins, although it is required for sensitive data systems. An outdated Windows policy is in place, with workstations still running Windows 7. Positive security practices include an employee acceptable use policy and regular security awareness training for all employees.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Outdated Windows Policy",
                        "Overview": "Computers are running Windows 7, which is an end-of-life operating system. This means it no longer receives security updates, making systems highly vulnerable to known and newly discovered exploits. The impact is a significant increase in the risk of malware infection, data breaches, and system compromise. This was identified via internal policy review or system audit.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                        "Risk": "Anonymous FTP Access",
                        "Overview": "The FTP service (vsftpd 2.3.4) on port 21 allows anonymous login. This configuration can lead to unauthorized access to files, potential data leakage, or even the uploading of malicious content if write permissions are enabled. The impact could range from information disclosure to system compromise. This was identified via Nmap script 'ftp-anon'.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Email",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing, as a single compromised password can grant full access to an employee's email. The impact includes potential business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and further internal network access. This was identified via organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Email System",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Computer Login",
                        "Overview": "Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for logging into computers. This leaves workstations vulnerable to unauthorized access if passwords are stolen, guessed, or brute-forced. A compromised workstation can serve as an entry point for lateral movement within the network, leading to data breaches or ransomware attacks. This was identified via organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Workstations",
                            "Network Access Points"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "It is strongly recommended to upgrade all workstations from Windows 7 to a currently supported operating system (e.g., Windows 10 or 11) to ensure ongoing security updates and patch management. The anonymous FTP access on port 21 must be disabled immediately; if FTP functionality is required, transition to secure protocols like SFTP or FTPS with robust authentication and access controls, and ensure the vsftpd service is updated. Furthermore, implement and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and computer logins to significantly reduce the risk of account compromise and unauthorized network access. Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments should be conducted to proactively identify and address emerging threats.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces several significant security vulnerabilities, including the presence of an outdated operating system (Windows 7) on workstations, an anonymously accessible FTP service, and a critical lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for both email access and computer logins. While the organization demonstrates good practices in security awareness training and acceptable use policies, these fundamental weaknesses expose it to a high risk of data breaches, unauthorized access, and system compromise. Addressing these vulnerabilities, particularly the implementation of MFA and OS upgrades, is crucial for improving the overall security posture and readiness against modern cyber threats."
