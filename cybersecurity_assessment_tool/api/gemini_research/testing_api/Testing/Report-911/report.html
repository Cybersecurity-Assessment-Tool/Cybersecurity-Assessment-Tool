        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open SSH port (22) on an unspecified host, indicating a potential entry point that requires careful security configuration. From an organizational standpoint, while security awareness training is conducted for new employees and annually for all staff, there are critical gaps in access control and policy. Specifically, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for accessing email or sensitive data systems, significantly increasing the risk of account compromise and data breaches. Furthermore, the absence of an employee acceptable use policy leaves the organization vulnerable to misuse of IT resources and inconsistent security practices.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A critical vulnerability was identified where a localhost service appears to be exposed, potentially allowing unauthorized access or information disclosure from an internal system. The high CVSS score indicates severe impact, suggesting that an attacker could gain significant control or access to sensitive data if this exposure is exploited. This was identified through internal risk assessment data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing, as a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to an employee's email, which often contains sensitive information and serves as a pivot point for further attacks. This was identified from the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not enforced for accessing systems containing sensitive data. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are compromised, potentially leading to severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and significant reputational damage. This was identified from the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>File shares</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy (AUP). Without a clear AUP, employees may be unaware of their responsibilities regarding company IT resources, data handling, and internet usage. This increases the risk of misuse, accidental data exposure, non-compliance with security best practices, and makes it harder to enforce security standards. This was identified from the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>IT resources</li><li>Data handling procedures</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH (port 22) was detected on a host during the network scan. While SSH is a legitimate service for remote administration, an open port without proper security configurations (e.g., strong passwords, key-based authentication, rate limiting, IP restrictions, disabling root login) can be a target for brute-force attacks or exploitation of SSH vulnerabilities, potentially leading to unauthorized remote access and system compromise. This was identified via network scanning.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with open port 22</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately investigate and secure the 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability by restricting access or isolating the service. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all email systems and sensitive data access points to significantly enhance credential security. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy (AUP) to clearly define employee responsibilities regarding IT resource usage and data handling. For the open SSH port, ensure robust security configurations are in place, including mandatory key-based authentication, disabling root login, strong password policies for all users, and implementing firewall rules to restrict access to trusted IP addresses only. Regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing should be conducted to proactively identify and address new exposures.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several significant cybersecurity risks, primarily stemming from critical access control deficiencies, policy gaps, and network-level exposures. While security awareness training is a positive step, the absence of MFA for email and sensitive data systems, coupled with an exposed localhost service and an unsecured open SSH port, presents a high-risk profile. The lack of an acceptable use policy further exacerbates these issues by creating potential for human error and inconsistent security practices. Addressing these vulnerabilities is crucial for improving the organization's overall security posture and readiness against cyber threats.</p>
