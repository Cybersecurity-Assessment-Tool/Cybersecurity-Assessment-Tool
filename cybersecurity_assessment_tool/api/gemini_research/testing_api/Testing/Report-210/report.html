        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates strong foundational security practices with mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. An employee acceptable use policy is in place, and security awareness training is conducted for new hires. However, annual security awareness training for all employees is not consistently performed. A recent network scan indicated that port 80 is closed, which contradicts a previously identified vulnerability regarding an unencrypted web server.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unencrypted Web Server - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Port 80 is listed as a vulnerability, indicating potential exposure of unencrypted web services. This allows for data interception and eavesdropping. However, a recent network scan (Nmap) reported port 80 as 'closed', suggesting this specific exposure might no longer be active or was misidentified in the current context. The vulnerability's original identification was based on a prior assessment where port 80 was found open.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>It is strongly recommended that the organization implement mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees. This will ensure that the entire workforce remains updated on the latest cybersecurity threats, best practices, and organizational policies, significantly reducing the risk of human-factor vulnerabilities. Regarding the 'Unencrypted Web Server' risk, while the recent scan shows port 80 as closed, it is crucial to verify the status of this port and ensure no unencrypted web services are inadvertently exposed on other ports or through other means. If port 80 were to become open, implementing SSL/TLS encryption is paramount. Continuous monitoring and regular vulnerability assessments are advised to maintain a robust security posture and reconcile discrepancies between historical and current scan data.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization has a solid baseline for cybersecurity readiness, particularly with its comprehensive MFA implementation and initial employee training. A key area for improvement is establishing a recurring annual security awareness training program for all employees. While a previously identified 'Unencrypted Web Server' risk exists, current network scan data indicates port 80 is closed, suggesting this specific vulnerability may no longer be active. Further investigation is recommended to reconcile this discrepancy and ensure all potential web service exposures are properly secured.</p>
