        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Based on the provided organizational data, the network's security posture appears to have several gaps, particularly concerning multi-factor authentication (MFA) for critical services and foundational security policies and training. While MFA is implemented for computer logins, it is notably absent for email and sensitive data systems, increasing the risk of unauthorized access. Furthermore, the lack of an acceptable use policy and security awareness training for new employees indicates a potential weakness in the human element of security, which is often a primary target for cyber threats. The absence of network scan data prevents a detailed technical assessment of network-level vulnerabilities.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or other means. A compromised email account can lead to further attacks, data exfiltration, and business email compromise (BEC) scams. This was identified by the 'Org Data' indicating 'No' for MFA on email.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li><li>Sensitive communications</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not enforced for accessing sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if a single set of credentials is stolen or guessed. Attackers gaining access to these systems could lead to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, financial loss, and reputational damage. This was identified by the 'Org Data' indicating 'No' for MFA on sensitive data systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>Confidential information</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy (AUP). Without a clear AUP, employees may be unaware of their responsibilities regarding the use of company IT resources, data handling, and internet usage. This can lead to risky behaviors, accidental data leaks, malware infections, and non-compliance with security best practices, increasing the overall attack surface. This was identified by the 'Org Data' indicating 'No' for an acceptable use policy.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training upon joining the organization. This means new hires may not be equipped with the necessary knowledge to identify and respond to common cyber threats like phishing, social engineering, or malware. Untrained new employees represent a significant human vulnerability that can be exploited by attackers, potentially leading to initial access for broader attacks. This was identified by the 'Org Data' indicating 'No' for security awareness training for new employees.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li><li>Incident response</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, the organization should prioritize the following actions: Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and sensitive data systems immediately to significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy (AUP) that clearly outlines expectations for IT resource usage, data handling, and security protocols. Furthermore, establish mandatory security awareness training for all new employees as part of their onboarding process, ensuring they are equipped to recognize and report potential cyber threats from day one. Regularly review and update these policies and training programs to adapt to evolving threat landscapes.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for email and sensitive data systems, a lack of a formal acceptable use policy, and insufficient security awareness training for new employees. While annual security training is conducted for all employees and MFA is used for computer logins, these gaps create critical vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers, leading to data breaches, operational disruptions, and reputational damage. Addressing these foundational security weaknesses is crucial for enhancing the organization's overall cyber readiness and protecting its assets.</p>
