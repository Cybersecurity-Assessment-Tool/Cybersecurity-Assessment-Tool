        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network infrastructure, as revealed by an Nmap scan, shows at least one active host with an open SSH port (22). Policy review indicates several critical gaps in security posture, including the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems, a lack of a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy, and insufficient annual security awareness training for all employees. These findings suggest a moderate to high-risk environment, with significant vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A critical vulnerability identified as "Localhost Exposed" indicates that a highly sensitive internal service or system is accessible in a manner that poses extreme risk. This could mean it's exposed to an untrusted network segment, the internet, or lacks proper access controls, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data exfiltration, or service disruption. This risk was identified through internal risk assessment data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email if credentials are compromised through phishing, malware, or brute-force attacks. Compromised email accounts can lead to business email compromise (BEC) scams, data breaches, and further internal network penetration. This vulnerability was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>User accounts</li><li>Authentication mechanisms</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for logging into systems containing sensitive data. This represents a critical security gap, as a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to confidential information, leading to severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and significant reputational damage. This vulnerability was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts</li><li>Authentication mechanisms</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy (AUP). Without clear guidelines on the appropriate use of company IT resources, employees may inadvertently engage in risky behaviors, such as visiting malicious websites, downloading unauthorized software, or misusing company assets. This increases the likelihood of malware infections, data leakage, and potential legal liabilities. This vulnerability was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>IT infrastructure</li><li>Data integrity</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual training for all employees. This leaves the workforce susceptible to evolving cyber threats, as knowledge and awareness can degrade over time. Employees may become less vigilant against new phishing techniques, social engineering tactics, and other emerging threats, increasing the risk of human-factor security incidents. This vulnerability was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li><li>Incident response capabilities</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port (Port 22) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An Nmap scan identified an open SSH (port 22) on an active host within the network. While SSH is a legitimate and secure protocol when properly configured, an open port 22, especially if exposed to the internet or an untrusted network segment, can be a target for brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or exploitation if the SSH server software is outdated or misconfigured. This could lead to unauthorized remote access to the affected host. This vulnerability was identified via network scan data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with open port 22</li><li>Network perimeter (if exposed externally)</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, immediate action is recommended across several fronts. Firstly, implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and, critically, for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised. Secondly, develop and formally implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy (AUP) to clearly define expectations for IT resource usage and mitigate risks associated with employee behavior. Concurrently, establish a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees to ensure ongoing education on evolving cyber threats and best practices. Furthermore, conduct an immediate investigation into the "Localhost Exposed" vulnerability to understand its scope, root cause, and implement appropriate remediation, which may include network segmentation, access control restrictions, or service removal. Finally, review and harden all SSH configurations on hosts with open port 22, ensuring strong authentication methods (e.g., key-based authentication), disabling root login, implementing rate limiting, and restricting access via firewall rules to only necessary source IPs.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several significant cybersecurity risks, ranging from critical vulnerabilities in authentication mechanisms (lack of MFA for email and sensitive data systems) to foundational policy gaps (absence of AUP and insufficient ongoing security awareness training). The presence of an open SSH port and an identified "Localhost Exposed" vulnerability further highlight potential entry points for attackers. While new employees receive initial security training, the overall readiness is compromised by these unaddressed risks. Addressing these vulnerabilities through the recommended actions is crucial for protecting sensitive data, maintaining operational integrity, and improving the organization's overall resilience against cyber threats.</p>
