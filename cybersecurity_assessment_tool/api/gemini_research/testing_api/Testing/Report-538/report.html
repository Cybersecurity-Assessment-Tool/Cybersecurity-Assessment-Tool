        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security practices, evidenced by the implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and an annual security awareness training program for all employees. An acceptable use policy is also in place. However, there are notable gaps in the application of MFA for critical services like email and sensitive data systems, and a lack of dedicated security awareness training for new hires.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee inboxes if credentials are compromised through phishing, keylogging, or brute-force attacks. Email often contains sensitive information and can be a gateway to other systems. This was identified through the organizational data indicating "Do you require MFA to access email?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li><li>Organizational data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not mandated for accessing systems containing sensitive organizational data. This leaves critical information vulnerable to unauthorized access if a single set of credentials is stolen. Attackers gaining access to these systems could lead to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and significant reputational and financial damage. This was identified through the organizational data indicating "Do you require MFA to access sensitive data systems?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>Confidential information</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees, there is no specific training provided for new employees during their onboarding process. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering attacks due to their unfamiliarity with organizational policies, procedures, and common threats. This gap can lead to new employees inadvertently introducing risks, such as falling for phishing scams or mishandling sensitive information, before they receive comprehensive training. This was identified through the organizational data indicating "Does your organization do security awareness training for new employees?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li><li>Potential for human error</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and for all systems containing sensitive data. This will significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access even if primary credentials are compromised. Additionally, a mandatory security awareness training program should be integrated into the onboarding process for all new employees to ensure they are equipped with essential cybersecurity knowledge from day one, complementing the existing annual training for all staff. Regular review and updates of security policies and training content are also advised to address evolving threat landscapes.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization has established a baseline of security controls, including MFA for computer logins and annual security awareness training. However, critical vulnerabilities exist due to the absence of MFA for email and sensitive data systems, and a gap in security awareness training for new employees. Addressing these areas is paramount to bolstering the organization's defense against common attack vectors and improving overall cybersecurity readiness.</p>
