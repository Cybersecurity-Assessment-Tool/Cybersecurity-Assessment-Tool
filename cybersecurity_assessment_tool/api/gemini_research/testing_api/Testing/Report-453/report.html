        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan identified an active host with an open port 8080, which was initially flagged as a potential risk due to its 'TOP SECRET DB' title but was later confirmed as secured and a false positive. While the organization implements Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers and accessing sensitive data systems, critical gaps exist in its security posture. Specifically, MFA is not required for email access, there is no employee acceptable use policy in place, and new employees do not receive initial security awareness training. The organization does conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts. This vulnerability makes the organization susceptible to phishing attacks, business email compromise (BEC), and potential data breaches, as email often contains sensitive information and serves as a gateway to other systems. This was identified through a review of organizational security policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee email accounts</li><li>Organizational data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. This absence leaves employees without clear guidelines regarding the appropriate and secure use of company IT resources, including hardware, software, and network access. This increases the risk of misuse of company assets, inadvertent data leakage, non-compliance with security best practices, and potential legal liabilities. This was identified through a review of organizational policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All IT systems</li><li>Employee conduct</li><li>Organizational data integrity</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees are not provided with initial security awareness training upon onboarding. This oversight leaves new hires vulnerable to common social engineering tactics, phishing attempts, and a general lack of understanding of the organization's security protocols and best practices from the outset. This increases the overall human risk factor and could lead to security incidents caused by new staff. This was identified through a review of organizational training programs.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Overall organizational security posture</li><li>Human element of security</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access to prevent unauthorized account compromise. Furthermore, a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy should be developed, communicated, and enforced across all staff to establish clear guidelines for IT resource usage. Crucially, a mandatory security awareness training program must be introduced for all new employees during their onboarding process to ensure they are equipped with essential security knowledge from day one. While annual training is commendable, these foundational elements are critical for a robust security posture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a mixed state of cybersecurity readiness. While positive steps have been taken with MFA for computer logins and sensitive data, and annual security awareness training is conducted, significant vulnerabilities remain. The lack of MFA for email, absence of an acceptable use policy, and the omission of initial security training for new employees represent critical gaps that could be exploited. Addressing these policy and training deficiencies is paramount to enhancing the organization's overall security posture and reducing its susceptibility to common cyber threats.</p>
