        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open port 8080 with a "TOP SECRET DB" title, which was later identified as a false positive and secured. However, a review of organizational data indicates significant gaps in foundational security practices. Specifically, the organization lacks multi-factor authentication (MFA) for critical access points including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, there is an absence of both new employee and annual security awareness training programs, which are vital for maintaining a vigilant security posture. While an acceptable use policy is in place, the lack of MFA and training exposes the organization to substantial risks from credential compromise and social engineering.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee inboxes if credentials are compromised through phishing or other means. Email accounts often contain sensitive information and can be used as a pivot point for further attacks.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for logging into computers. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if user credentials are stolen or guessed. A compromised workstation can lead to lateral movement within the network and access to internal resources.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All organizational computers</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for accessing sensitive data systems. This is a critical vulnerability as it directly exposes the most valuable assets to a single point of failure (password). A breach of these systems could lead to severe data loss, regulatory fines, and reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>File shares</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering attacks due to their unfamiliarity with organizational policies and common threats. This lack of training increases the likelihood of successful phishing, malware infections, and policy violations.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational network</li><li>Data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training for All Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. Regular training is crucial to keep employees updated on evolving threats, reinforce best practices, and maintain a strong security culture. Without it, employees may become complacent or unaware of new attack vectors, increasing the overall human risk factor.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational network</li><li>Data</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, including email systems, computer logins, and especially sensitive data systems, as a top priority. Concurrently, a comprehensive security awareness training program should be established. This program must include mandatory training for all new employees upon onboarding and annual refresher training for all existing staff to ensure continuous education on current threats and best practices. Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments should also be conducted to proactively identify and address potential weaknesses.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to the absence of multi-factor authentication for key access points and a lack of comprehensive security awareness training for its employees. While an acceptable use policy exists, its effectiveness is diminished without the reinforcement of training and robust technical controls like MFA. Addressing these fundamental gaps is crucial for improving the organization's readiness against common cyber threats and protecting its sensitive data and systems.</p>
