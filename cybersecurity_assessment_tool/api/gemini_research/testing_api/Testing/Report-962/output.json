            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network currently operates an FTP server (vsftpd 2.3.4) that permits anonymous login, posing a significant security risk. While the organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, and has an employee acceptable use policy, a critical gap exists in security awareness training. Specifically, new employees do not receive security awareness training, nor is annual training provided to all employees. Furthermore, workstations are running Windows 7, an end-of-life operating system, which introduces severe vulnerabilities due to a lack of security updates.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Anonymous FTP Login Allowed",
                        "Overview": "The FTP server (vsftpd version 2.3.4) is configured to allow anonymous login. This configuration can lead to unauthorized access to files, potential data leakage, or even server compromise if write permissions are misconfigured. This vulnerability was identified through an Nmap scan utilizing the 'ftp-anon' script.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "FTP server (vsftpd 2.3.4)",
                            "Port 21"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees upon onboarding, nor does it provide annual refresher training for all employees. This absence significantly elevates the risk of successful phishing attacks, social engineering incidents, and other human-factor vulnerabilities, as employees may lack awareness of current threats and best security practices.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "Organizational security posture"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Outdated Windows Policy (Windows 7)",
                        "Overview": "Workstations within the organization are running Windows 7, an operating system that has reached its end-of-life. This means it no longer receives critical security updates, leaving these systems highly susceptible to known and newly discovered exploits. The impact includes a high risk of system compromise, data breaches, and potential non-compliance with security standards.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Workstations"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately disable anonymous login on the FTP server and enforce strong authentication mechanisms. Furthermore, the FTP server software (vsftpd 2.3.4) should be updated to a currently supported and secure version. A comprehensive security awareness training program must be implemented, including mandatory training for all new employees and annual refresher courses for the entire staff. Crucially, all workstations running Windows 7 must be upgraded to a currently supported operating system, such as Windows 10 or 11, to ensure ongoing security updates and protection against modern threats. Regular vulnerability scanning and patching cycles should also be established to proactively identify and address new weaknesses.",
            "Conclusion": "While the organization has a commendable foundation with MFA in place for critical systems and an acceptable use policy, significant vulnerabilities exist. The presence of an anonymous FTP server, the use of end-of-life Windows 7 workstations, and the complete absence of security awareness training for employees collectively present a critical risk to the organization's data integrity and overall security posture. Addressing these high and critical severity issues is paramount to enhancing the organization's readiness against cyber threats."
