        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network details were not provided in the scan data. However, an assessment of organizational security practices reveals several areas for improvement, particularly concerning Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access, the absence of an employee acceptable use policy, and a complete lack of security awareness training for both new and existing employees. While MFA is implemented for computer logins and sensitive data systems, the lack of it for email access presents a significant attack vector. The absence of foundational policies and training indicates a low level of organizational readiness against common cyber threats.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks. Compromised email accounts can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and further network penetration. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This means there are no formal guidelines defining the appropriate use of company IT resources, data, and internet access. Without such a policy, employees may unknowingly engage in risky behaviors, increasing the likelihood of security incidents, data breaches, and compliance violations. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>IT resources</li><li>Data assets</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering attacks due to their unfamiliarity with organizational security protocols and common threats. The absence of initial training leaves them vulnerable to phishing, malware, and other attacks, potentially compromising the organization's security posture from day one. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Annual Security Awareness Training for All Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. Regular training is crucial to keep employees informed about evolving cyber threats, reinforce security best practices, and maintain a strong security culture. Without ongoing training, employees may forget previous guidance, become complacent, or fail to recognize new attack vectors, leading to increased susceptibility to various cyber threats. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, the organization should immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access. This is a critical step to protect against credential theft. Concurrently, a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy must be developed, communicated, and enforced to establish clear guidelines for IT resource usage. Furthermore, a robust security awareness training program should be established, including mandatory training for all new employees upon onboarding and annual refresher training for all existing staff. These measures will significantly enhance the organization's defense against social engineering and improve overall security hygiene.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently exhibits significant vulnerabilities primarily stemming from a lack of foundational security policies and training. While MFA is in place for sensitive systems and computer logins, the absence of MFA for email, an acceptable use policy, and any form of security awareness training (for new or existing employees) leaves the organization highly susceptible to common cyber threats, particularly those involving human factors like phishing and social engineering. Addressing these gaps is crucial for improving the organization's overall security readiness and reducing its attack surface.</p>
