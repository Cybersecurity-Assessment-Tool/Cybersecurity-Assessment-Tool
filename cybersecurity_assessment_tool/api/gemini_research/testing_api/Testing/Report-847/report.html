        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan data indicates an open SSH port (22) on an unspecified host, suggesting potential remote access capabilities. Organizational data reveals several critical gaps in security posture. Specifically, the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access, the lack of an employee acceptable use policy, and the omission of security awareness training for new employees are significant areas of concern. While annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees and MFA is required for computer logins and sensitive data systems, these specific deficiencies expose the organization to various cyber threats.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks. If an attacker gains access to an employee's email, it can lead to further internal network access, data exfiltration, business email compromise (BEC) scams, and reputational damage. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on email access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email accounts</li><li>Email server/service</li><li>Employee credentials</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy (AUP). Without a clear AUP, employees may be unaware of their responsibilities regarding the use of company IT resources, data handling, and internet usage. This can lead to misuse of company assets, exposure to malware, data breaches, and non-compliance with regulatory requirements. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for an acceptable use policy.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Sensitive data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not provide security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering attacks due to their unfamiliarity with company policies and procedures. This gap leaves the organization vulnerable to phishing, pretexting, and other human-centric attacks from the moment a new employee joins, potentially leading to initial access for attackers. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for security awareness training for new employees.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network access</li><li>Company reputation</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port (22) Exposure - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH port (22) was identified during the network scan. While SSH is a legitimate service, an exposed SSH port without proper hardening (e.g., strong, unique passwords, key-based authentication, rate limiting, IP restrictions, disabling root login) can be a target for brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or exploitation of SSH vulnerabilities. Successful compromise could grant an attacker remote access to the underlying system. This was identified via the Nmap scan data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with open port 22</li><li>SSH service</li><li>Network perimeter</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access. This is a critical step to protect against credential theft and account compromise. Concurrently, a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy (AUP) should be developed, communicated, and enforced to clearly define expectations for IT resource usage and data handling. Furthermore, a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees must be established to educate them on common cyber threats and company security protocols from day one. For the open SSH port, a thorough review of its necessity and configuration is advised. If required, implement robust security measures such as key-based authentication, disable password authentication, restrict access to trusted IP addresses, and ensure regular patching of the SSH service. Regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing should also be conducted to identify and address potential weaknesses proactively.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily stemming from gaps in its security policies and employee training, particularly the lack of MFA for email and the absence of initial security awareness training for new hires. While some security measures like annual training and MFA for sensitive systems are in place, these critical deficiencies leave the organization vulnerable to common attack vectors. Addressing these issues with the recommended actions is crucial for enhancing the overall security posture and readiness against evolving cyber threats.</p>
