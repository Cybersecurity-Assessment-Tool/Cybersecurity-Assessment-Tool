            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network scan revealed an open RDP port (3389), indicating potential exposure. Furthermore, the organization currently does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access, computer logins, or sensitive data systems. While an acceptable use policy is in place and annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees, there is no specific security awareness training for new employees.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "RDP Exposure",
                        "Overview": "Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed, meaning it is accessible from outside the internal network. This allows potential attackers to attempt brute-force attacks or exploit vulnerabilities in the RDP service to gain unauthorized access to internal systems. The impact could range from unauthorized data access to full system compromise. This was identified through a network scan showing port 3389 (ms-wbt-server) as open.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "IP"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "Immediate action should be taken to mitigate the RDP exposure by closing port 3389 to external access. For long-term secure remote access, implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution. Additionally, the organization should implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, to significantly enhance account security. It is also recommended to introduce security awareness training specifically for new employees to ensure they are aware of security best practices from day one.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization faces critical security risks primarily due to an exposed RDP service and a lack of MFA implementation across key access points. While some foundational security practices like an acceptable use policy and annual security training are present, the absence of MFA and specific new employee training leaves significant gaps. Addressing these vulnerabilities is crucial for improving the overall security posture and readiness against cyber threats."
