        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open SSH port (22), indicating a potential entry point that requires careful securing. From a policy and readiness perspective, the organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, which is a positive security measure. However, a significant gap exists as MFA is not required for accessing sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy, which is crucial for setting behavioral guidelines and mitigating internal risks. While new employees receive security awareness training, there is no annual training for all employees, leading to potential degradation of security knowledge over time. A critical vulnerability related to 'Localhost Exposed' was also identified, posing an immediate and severe threat.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The system has a critical vulnerability exposing localhost, which could lead to unauthorized access or data breaches. This was identified through a security scan indicating a critical exposure with a CVSS score of 10.0.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if credentials are compromised, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive Data Systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines, employees may engage in activities that inadvertently introduce security risks, such as improper use of company resources, unauthorized software installations, or unsafe browsing habits. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employees</li><li>Organizational Policies</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Infrequent Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual training for all employees. This leads to a degradation of security knowledge over time, making employees more susceptible to evolving threats like phishing, social engineering, and malware. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employees</li><li>Security Training Program</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed SSH Service - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An Nmap scan identified an open SSH port (22) on a host within the network. While SSH is a legitimate service, an exposed port without proper hardening (e.g., strong passwords, key-based authentication, rate limiting, IP restrictions) can be a target for brute-force attacks or other exploits. This was identified via network scanning.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Network Host</li><li>Port 22 (SSH)</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is imperative to immediately investigate and remediate the 'Localhost Exposed' critical vulnerability. Furthermore, implement mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to establish clear guidelines for secure behavior and resource utilization. Establish a program for mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees to ensure up-to-date knowledge of evolving threats. Finally, secure the exposed SSH service by implementing best practices such as using key-based authentication, disabling root login, changing the default port, and applying strict firewall rules to limit access.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces a critical security vulnerability ('Localhost Exposed') and several high to medium risks stemming from both technical configurations and policy gaps. While MFA is in place for email and computer logins, the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems, a formal acceptable use policy, and annual security awareness training significantly weakens the overall security posture. Addressing these identified vulnerabilities and implementing the recommended security enhancements is crucial for improving the organization's readiness against cyber threats and protecting its sensitive assets.</p>
