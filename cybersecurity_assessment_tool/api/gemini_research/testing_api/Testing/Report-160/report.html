        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to security awareness training for all employees, including new hires, and has an acceptable use policy in place. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is mandated for accessing email and sensitive data systems. However, a recent network scan using Nmap did not identify any open ports, suggesting a well-hardened external perimeter or that the scan was limited in scope. A key area for improvement is the lack of MFA for computer logins, which presents a significant internal risk.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for employees to log into their computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to internal systems and data if an employee's credentials are compromised (e.g., via phishing or brute-force attacks). Without a second factor, a stolen password is often sufficient for an attacker to gain access, potentially leading to lateral movement within the network. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational security policy questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Internal network access</li><li>Sensitive data systems accessible from logged-in computers</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>It is strongly recommended that the organization implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins. This critical security control will add an essential layer of defense against credential theft and unauthorized access, significantly reducing the risk of internal breaches. Evaluate and deploy a robust MFA solution that integrates seamlessly with existing identity management systems. Additionally, ensure that the scope of network scans is comprehensive, covering all internal and external assets to identify any potential overlooked open ports or services.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization exhibits a commendable foundation in security awareness and policy enforcement, particularly with MFA for email and sensitive data. However, the absence of MFA for computer logins represents a significant vulnerability that could be exploited by attackers to gain initial access to internal systems. Addressing this gap is paramount to enhancing the overall security posture and readiness against evolving cyber threats.</p>
