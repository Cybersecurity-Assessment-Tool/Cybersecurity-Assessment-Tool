        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to foundational security practices by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, it conducts regular security awareness training for both new and existing employees. However, a notable gap exists in the absence of a formal employee acceptable use policy. Network scan data provided was minimal, indicating port 80 is closed, which is a positive finding, but does not offer a comprehensive view of the network's external attack surface.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. This absence can lead to inconsistent employee behavior regarding company assets and data, increasing the risk of misuse, data breaches, and non-compliance. Without clear guidelines, employees may unknowingly engage in activities that compromise security, leading to potential legal and reputational damage. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Organizational Policy</li><li>Employee Conduct</li><li>Data Security</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to develop and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy. This policy should clearly define expectations for employee conduct regarding company resources, data handling, and internet usage. Regular communication and training on this policy should be integrated into the existing security awareness program. Additionally, while current MFA and training initiatives are commendable, continuous monitoring and regular, more extensive network vulnerability scanning are advised to proactively identify and address potential technical weaknesses.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Overall, the organization exhibits a good baseline for cybersecurity readiness, particularly in its robust implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication and consistent security awareness training. The immediate technical attack surface appears minimal based on the provided scan data. However, the absence of an employee acceptable use policy represents a significant organizational vulnerability that could lead to human-factor related security incidents. Addressing this policy gap is crucial for maturing the organization's overall security posture and mitigating risks associated with employee behavior.</p>
