        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to foundational security controls, including multi-factor authentication (MFA) across email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. An acceptable use policy is also in place, and annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees. However, a critical gap exists in the onboarding process, as new employees do not receive security awareness training. Network scans identified an open port 8080 with an HTTP title 'TOP SECRET DB', which was subsequently assessed and confirmed as secured and a false positive, indicating no active vulnerability from this finding.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2><p>No specific vulnerabilities were identified.</p><h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To further enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement mandatory security awareness training for all new employees as part of their onboarding process. This will ensure that all personnel are equipped with essential cybersecurity knowledge from day one, reducing the risk of human-factor vulnerabilities. While the finding on port 8080 was deemed a false positive, it is prudent to regularly review and audit all open ports and services, especially those with potentially misleading titles, to prevent future misconfigurations or overlooked risks.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization has a robust foundation in place with widespread MFA adoption and an acceptable use policy. The annual security awareness training for existing employees is commendable. The absence of security awareness training for new employees represents the primary area for immediate improvement. Overall, the organization is in a good state of readiness, but addressing the new employee training gap is crucial for maintaining a consistent and strong security posture.</p>
