        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, and an acceptable use policy is in place. New employees receive security awareness training. A network scan identified an open port 8080 with the title 'TOP SECRET DB'. While an initial assessment indicated this port is secured, its sensitive naming warrants further scrutiny. Critical gaps include the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems and the lack of annual security awareness training for all employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Authentication for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if credentials are compromised through phishing, malware, or other means. A single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to sensitive data, leading to data breaches and compliance violations. This vulnerability was identified from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inconsistent Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This leaves the workforce vulnerable to evolving social engineering tactics, phishing attacks, and other common threats as employees may forget best practices or not be updated on new threats. A lack of regular training can lead to human error being a primary attack vector, potentially compromising organizational security. This vulnerability was identified from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data susceptible to social engineering</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised. Furthermore, a comprehensive annual security awareness training program should be established for all employees to ensure continuous education on evolving cyber threats and best practices, thereby reducing the risk of human error. The 'TOP SECRET DB' on port 8080 should be thoroughly reviewed to confirm its security posture and ensure it does not pose an unintended risk, despite the initial assessment.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization has some foundational security controls in place, such as MFA for email and computer logins, and an acceptable use policy. However, significant vulnerabilities exist concerning the protection of sensitive data systems due to the absence of MFA, and the overall human firewall is weakened by the lack of consistent, annual security awareness training for all employees. Addressing these gaps is crucial for enhancing the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and reducing its attack surface.</p>
