        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes an open Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) port (3389), posing a critical security risk. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is utilized for email and sensitive data systems, it is not enforced for computer logins, creating a significant vulnerability. The organization has an acceptable use policy in place and conducts annual security awareness training for all employees; however, there is a notable gap in providing security awareness training specifically for new employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>RDP Exposure - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed to the internet via an open port (3389). This allows potential attackers to attempt brute-force attacks or exploit RDP vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to internal systems. The impact could range from unauthorized access to data breaches or system compromise. This was identified through a network scan showing port 3389 as open.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication. The impact could lead to lateral movement within the network and access to sensitive data. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers</li><li>Internal network access</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not provide dedicated security awareness training for new employees. This leaves new hires vulnerable to social engineering attacks, phishing, and other common threats during their initial period, potentially exposing the organization to risks before they receive annual training. The impact could be initial compromise through human error. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately close the exposed RDP port (3389) and implement a VPN for secure remote access. Furthermore, enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised. Implement a mandatory security awareness training program specifically for all new employees during their onboarding process to ensure they are aware of common threats and best practices from day one. Regularly review and update the acceptable use policy and continue annual security awareness training for all employees.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces critical risks due to an exposed RDP port, which could lead to unauthorized system access. Additional high and medium risks stem from the lack of MFA for computer logins and the absence of security awareness training for new employees, increasing the potential for credential compromise and human-factor vulnerabilities. While some security measures are in place, such as MFA for sensitive systems and annual training, these gaps significantly impact the organization's overall readiness against cyber threats.</p>
