        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open port 8080, which appears to be hosting a web service titled "TOP SECRET DB". This indicates a potentially critical exposure of sensitive information or systems. Furthermore, the organizational data highlights significant gaps in security policies and training. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for email and computer logins, it is notably absent for sensitive data systems. The organization also lacks an an employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct security awareness training for new or existing employees annually. These deficiencies collectively point to a low security readiness posture, particularly concerning data exposure and human factor risks.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed "TOP SECRET DB" on Port 8080 - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open port 8080 was identified, hosting a web service with the title "TOP SECRET DB". This directly exposes what appears to be a highly sensitive database or system to the network, potentially the internet if the host is externally accessible. The impact could be severe, including unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or system compromise. This was identified via an Nmap scan using the http-title script.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li><li>Host with "TOP SECRET DB" service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or other means. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to critical data. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This means there are no formal guidelines or rules for employees regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, data, and networks. This absence can lead to misuse of resources, increased risk of data breaches, introduction of malware, and non-compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees, nor does it provide annual training for all employees. This leaves employees vulnerable to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting), unaware of best security practices, and potentially prone to making errors that could compromise security. Human error is a leading cause of security incidents, and lack of training exacerbates this risk. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediate Action for Port 8080: Immediately investigate the service running on port 8080. If it is not intended for public access, it must be secured, firewalled, or shut down. If it is an internal service, ensure it is properly authenticated, authorized, and segmented from less trusted networks. Review logs for any signs of unauthorized access. Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems: Mandate and implement Multi-Factor Authentication for all sensitive data systems without delay. This is a critical control to prevent unauthorized access even if primary credentials are stolen. Develop and Enforce an Acceptable Use Policy: Create a comprehensive acceptable use policy that clearly outlines employee responsibilities regarding IT asset usage, data handling, and internet browsing. Ensure all employees acknowledge and adhere to this policy. Establish a Robust Security Awareness Training Program: Implement mandatory security awareness training for all new hires as part of their onboarding process. Furthermore, establish an annual recurring security awareness training program for all employees, covering topics such as phishing, password hygiene, data handling, and incident reporting. Regular Vulnerability Scanning and Penetration Testing: Conduct regular vulnerability scans and periodic penetration tests to identify and address new or evolving security weaknesses across the network and applications.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks stemming from both technical vulnerabilities and critical gaps in its security posture and employee training. The exposed "TOP SECRET DB" on port 8080 represents an immediate and critical threat of data compromise. Furthermore, the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems, coupled with a complete lack of security awareness training and an acceptable use policy, creates a highly susceptible environment for social engineering attacks and human error-induced breaches. While MFA is present for email and computer logins, these other deficiencies severely undermine the overall security readiness. Urgent action is required to address these identified vulnerabilities and establish foundational security practices to protect organizational assets and data.</p>
