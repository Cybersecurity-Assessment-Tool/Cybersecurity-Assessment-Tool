        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an active host with an open SSH service (port 22). A critical vulnerability related to localhost exposure was also identified. Furthermore, a review of organizational data indicates significant gaps in security posture, including a complete absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. The organization also lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not provide security awareness training for new employees, although annual training is conducted for all employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A critical vulnerability was identified where the localhost is exposed, potentially allowing unauthorized access or information disclosure. This exposure presents a severe risk, as it could be exploited to gain control over the system or access sensitive internal resources. The vulnerability was identified through a security assessment scan.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Multi-Factor Authentication - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email, logging into computers, or accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are compromised through phishing, malware, or other means, as a single factor (password) is the only barrier to entry. This policy gap was identified through organizational security policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email systems</li><li>User login systems</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy (AUP). Without an AUP, there are no formal guidelines for employees regarding the appropriate and secure use of company IT resources, including networks, devices, and data. This absence can lead to misuse of resources, increased risk of data breaches, and non-compliance with security best practices. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Organizational policies</li><li>Employee conduct</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate New Employee Security Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. This leaves new hires vulnerable to common social engineering attacks, such as phishing and pretexting, and unaware of critical security protocols and best practices from the start of their employment. This increases the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed SSH Service without MFA - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH (port 22) service was detected on a host within the network. While SSH is a legitimate service for remote administration, the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins (as indicated by organizational data) significantly elevates the risk. This configuration allows for potential brute-force attacks or credential stuffing attacks to gain unauthorized remote access with just a compromised password, bypassing a critical layer of security. This was identified via network scan and policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with open port 22</li><li>SSH service</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is critically important to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, to significantly enhance credential security. The exposed localhost vulnerability requires immediate investigation and remediation to prevent unauthorized access. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to guide appropriate IT resource usage. Furthermore, establish mandatory security awareness training for all new employees to ensure they are equipped with essential security knowledge from day one. For the exposed SSH service, ensure it is only accessible from trusted networks, implement strong password policies, and enforce MFA for all SSH access. Regularly review and update security configurations and policies.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several significant cybersecurity risks, primarily stemming from critical technical vulnerabilities like localhost exposure and an open SSH port, compounded by a widespread lack of Multi-Factor Authentication. Policy and training gaps, specifically the absence of an acceptable use policy and new employee security training, further weaken the overall security posture. While annual security awareness training is conducted, these foundational weaknesses indicate a low level of readiness against sophisticated cyber threats, necessitating immediate and comprehensive security enhancements.</p>
