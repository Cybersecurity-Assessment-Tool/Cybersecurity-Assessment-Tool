        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan identified an Nginx web server running version 1.18.0 on port 443 (HTTPS). While HTTPS is in use, the Nginx version is older and may lack recent security updates. Organizational data indicates a mixed security posture: an acceptable use policy is in place, and new employees receive security awareness training. However, critical gaps exist, including the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and computer logins, and a lack of annual security awareness training for all employees. MFA is only required for sensitive data systems.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks. If an attacker gains access to an employee's email, they could potentially reset passwords for other services, access sensitive communications, or launch further attacks within the organization.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This leaves employee workstations vulnerable to unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or guessed. An attacker gaining access to a workstation could potentially access internal networks, sensitive data, or deploy malware, leading to data breaches or operational disruption.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Internal network access</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Nginx Web Server Version - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nginx web server is running version 1.18.0. While this is a stable release, it is an older version (released in 2020) and may not include the latest security patches and bug fixes available in newer stable branches (e.g., 1.20.x, 1.22.x, 1.24.x). Running outdated software increases the risk of exploitation by known vulnerabilities for which patches exist in newer versions, potentially leading to unauthorized access or service disruption.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Web server (nginx 1.18.0)</li><li>Port 443 (HTTPS)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization conducts security awareness training for new employees but does not provide annual training for all employees. This means existing employees may not be regularly updated on new threats, evolving best practices, and organizational policies, increasing the risk of human-factor vulnerabilities such as phishing, social engineering, and improper data handling, which can lead to security incidents.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and computer logins across the organization. This is a critical step to significantly enhance protection against credential theft. Furthermore, the Nginx web server should be updated to the latest stable version to ensure all known security patches are applied and to benefit from the most recent security features. Finally, a comprehensive annual security awareness training program should be established for all employees, not just new hires, to ensure continuous education on current threats, best practices, and organizational security policies.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates some foundational security practices, such as an acceptable use policy and initial security awareness training. However, significant vulnerabilities exist due to the lack of MFA for email and computer access, the use of an older web server version, and insufficient ongoing security awareness training. Addressing these critical and medium-severity risks is paramount to improving the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and readiness against common attack vectors.</p>
