        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes a MySQL database (version 5.7.33) on port 3306, indicating a potential vulnerability to unauthorized access. Furthermore, a review of organizational policies reveals critical gaps in security posture: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for email access, computer logins, or sensitive data systems. The organization also lacks security awareness training for both new and existing employees, although an employee acceptable use policy is in place.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network. This exposes the database to potential unauthorized access, data breaches, and service disruption if not properly secured. Identified via Nmap scan.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts through phishing or credential stuffing attacks, potentially leading to business email compromise and data exfiltration. Identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email access systems</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are compromised, potentially allowing attackers to gain a foothold within the internal network. Identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations</li><li>Servers</li><li>Employee login processes</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This is a critical vulnerability as it means that a single compromised password could grant an attacker access to highly confidential information, leading to severe data breaches, regulatory fines, and reputational damage. Identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases containing sensitive information</li><li>Cloud storage for sensitive data</li></ul>

            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of New Employee Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. This means new hires may not be aware of common cyber threats, organizational security policies, or best practices, making them susceptible to social engineering attacks and increasing the risk of internal security incidents. Identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. This leads to a stale understanding of evolving cyber threats and security best practices among the workforce, increasing the overall human risk factor for phishing, malware, and other social engineering attacks. Identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is crucial to immediately implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306 (TCP) to only trusted internal IP addresses or specific application servers. For external access, ensure a secure VPN connection is required. Long-term, consider migrating sensitive data to a more secure, isolated network segment or cloud-managed database service with robust access controls. Most importantly, implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, including email systems, computer logins, and especially sensitive data systems. This is a fundamental security control that significantly reduces the risk of credential compromise. Furthermore, establish a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees during onboarding and implement annual refresher training for all staff to keep them informed about current threats and best practices. Regularly review and update security policies and procedures, including the acceptable use policy, to ensure they align with current threat landscapes and organizational needs.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization faces significant security risks primarily due to an exposed database service and a critical lack of fundamental security controls, specifically Multi-Factor Authentication across key access points and comprehensive security awareness training for its workforce. While an acceptable use policy is in place, its effectiveness is severely diminished without proper enforcement and consistent user education. Addressing these vulnerabilities is paramount to prevent unauthorized access, mitigate the risk of data breaches, and establish a robust and resilient security posture against evolving cyber threats.</p>
