        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The network scan identified an active host with an open SSH service (port 22), indicating a potential entry point for remote access. Organizational data reveals a mixed security posture: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for email and computer logins, which is a positive step. However, critical security controls such as MFA for sensitive data systems, an employee acceptable use policy, and regular security awareness training for both new and existing employees are currently absent.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Access Control for Sensitive Data - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or other means. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to sensitive data, leading to potential data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and reputational damage. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This means there are no formal guidelines for employees regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, data handling, internet usage, and security best practices. This absence can lead to misuse of company assets, increased risk of data breaches due to unapproved software or risky online behavior, and non-compliance with industry regulations, as employees may unknowingly engage in activities that compromise security. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Data handling processes</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training. This leaves them vulnerable to common cyber threats such as phishing, social engineering, and malware, as they may not be aware of the organization's security policies, best practices, or how to identify and report suspicious activities. This increases the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents and successful attacks targeting new staff members. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Email systems</li><li>Internal networks</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Annual Security Awareness Training for All Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. Regular training is crucial to keep employees updated on evolving cyber threats, reinforce security best practices, and maintain a strong security culture. Without it, employees' knowledge of security risks can become outdated, increasing the organization's susceptibility to various attacks over time and diminishing the effectiveness of other security controls. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Overall organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed SSH Service - <span class="severity-Low">Low</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nmap scan identified an open SSH (port 22) service. While SSH is a legitimate service for secure remote access, an open port represents a potential attack surface for brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or exploitation of SSH vulnerabilities if the service is not properly secured (e.g., strong passwords, key-based authentication, rate limiting, up-to-date software). Without proper hardening, this service could be compromised, granting unauthorized remote access. This vulnerability was identified through the network scan data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Server hosting SSH service</li><li>Network perimeter</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems immediately to prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to guide appropriate behavior regarding IT resource usage, data handling, and internet usage. Establish mandatory security awareness training for all new employees upon onboarding and conduct annual refresher training for all staff to ensure up-to-date knowledge of cyber threats and best practices. For the exposed SSH service, ensure strong authentication methods (e.g., key-based authentication, disable password authentication), implement rate limiting, keep the SSH server software updated, and consider restricting access to trusted IP addresses only through firewall rules.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently exhibits several significant vulnerabilities, primarily stemming from a lack of comprehensive policy enforcement and employee training, alongside a critical gap in access control for sensitive data systems. While MFA is in place for email and computer logins, the absence of it for sensitive data, coupled with the lack of an acceptable use policy and consistent security awareness training, creates substantial risks related to data breaches and human error. The open SSH port also presents a potential attack vector that requires careful management. Addressing these areas is crucial for improving the overall security readiness and reducing the likelihood of successful cyberattacks.</p>
