        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and access to sensitive data systems, which is a positive security measure. However, MFA is not required for email access, posing a significant risk. The organization also lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees, indicating gaps in foundational security practices. A network scan identified an unencrypted web server with port 80 open, exposing potential data in transit to interception.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unencrypted Web Server - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An unencrypted web server was identified with port 80 found to be open. This means that any data transmitted over this port is sent in plain text, making it vulnerable to interception and eavesdropping by malicious actors. This could lead to the compromise of sensitive information, user credentials, or other proprietary data. The vulnerability was identified through a network scan that detected an active service on port 80 without encryption.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access to prevent unauthorized access to employee accounts. The unencrypted web server on port 80 should be secured by either closing the port if it's not essential, or more robustly, by implementing SSL/TLS encryption (HTTPS) to protect data in transit. Furthermore, the organization should develop and enforce an employee acceptable use policy to define expected behavior and security responsibilities. Regular, at least annual, security awareness training for all employees is crucial to educate staff on current threats, best practices, and the importance of adhering to security policies.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a mixed security posture. While MFA is in place for critical systems like computer logins and sensitive data access, the absence of MFA for email, lack of an acceptable use policy, and infrequent security awareness training represent significant foundational weaknesses. The presence of an unencrypted web server further highlights a need for immediate technical remediation. Addressing these vulnerabilities through policy implementation, employee education, and technical controls is essential to enhance the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and reduce its attack surface.</p>
