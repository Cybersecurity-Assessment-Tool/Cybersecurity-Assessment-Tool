        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems, and maintaining an acceptable use policy. Annual security awareness training is conducted for existing employees. However, critical gaps exist in endpoint security and new employee onboarding, specifically regarding MFA for computer logins and initial security awareness training for new hires. The provided network scan data and current vulnerabilities report were broken and could not be analyzed for technical findings.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for employees to log into their computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication. An attacker gaining access to a workstation could potentially pivot to other systems or sensitive data. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network endpoints</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While the organization conducts annual security awareness training for all employees, new hires do not receive initial security awareness training. This leaves new employees vulnerable to social engineering attacks, phishing, and other common threats during their initial period, as they may not be aware of the organization's security policies, best practices, and common attack vectors. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li><li>Potential for social engineering incidents</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>It is strongly recommended that the organization implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to significantly enhance endpoint security and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access from compromised credentials. Additionally, a mandatory security awareness training program should be integrated into the onboarding process for all new employees. This will ensure that new hires are immediately equipped with the necessary knowledge of security policies, best practices, and threat identification, reducing their susceptibility to social engineering and other common attacks from day one.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization has established some good security practices, including MFA for critical systems and annual security training for existing staff. However, the absence of MFA for computer logins and a lack of initial security awareness training for new employees represent significant vulnerabilities that could be exploited. Addressing these areas is crucial for improving the overall security posture and readiness against common cyber threats.</p>
