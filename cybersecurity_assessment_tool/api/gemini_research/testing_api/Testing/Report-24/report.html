        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to cybersecurity through its established employee acceptable use policy and consistent security awareness training for both new and existing employees. However, critical vulnerabilities exist in the implementation of multi-factor authentication (MFA), specifically for email access and computer logins. While MFA is utilized for sensitive data systems, its absence in these other key areas significantly elevates the risk of unauthorized access and potential breaches, despite the positive aspects of their security awareness programs.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. Email is a primary vector for phishing, business email compromise (BEC), and credential stuffing attacks. Without MFA, a compromised username and password pair can grant an attacker full access to an employee's inbox, leading to potential data exfiltration, impersonation, and further attacks on internal or external entities. This vulnerability was identified through the organization's self-reported security policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>User email accounts</li><li>Sensitive communications</li><li>Cloud-based applications linked to email</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to workstations and the internal network if user credentials are stolen, guessed, or brute-forced. Attackers gaining access to a computer can perform lateral movement, install malware, exfiltrate data, or disrupt operations. This vulnerability was identified through the organization's self-reported security policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network access points</li><li>Internal network resources</li><li>User accounts on domain/local machines</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>It is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and computer logins. This should be a top priority to significantly reduce the risk of credential compromise and unauthorized access. Evaluate and deploy a robust MFA solution that integrates seamlessly with existing identity management systems. Conduct targeted training sessions to educate employees on the importance of MFA and guide them through the enrollment process. Additionally, regularly review and update security policies to ensure consistent application of MFA across all critical systems and access points.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently exhibits a mixed security posture. While commendable efforts are made in security awareness training and policy development, the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for email and computer logins represents a critical gap in its defense strategy. Addressing these MFA deficiencies is paramount to enhancing overall readiness and protecting against common and impactful cyber threats.</p>
