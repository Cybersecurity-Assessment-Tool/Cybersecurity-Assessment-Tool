        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The provided network scan data is minimal, indicating only one host is up with port 22 (SSH) open. This suggests either a very limited scope of the scan or a highly restricted network perimeter. Further scanning would be required for a comprehensive understanding of the network's external attack surface. Organizational data reveals several critical policy and control gaps.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. A compromised email account can lead to further attacks, data exfiltration, and business email compromise (BEC) scams. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee email accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk, as a single compromised credential could grant an attacker access to highly confidential information, leading to data breaches, regulatory fines, reputational damage, and competitive disadvantage. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Confidential data repositories</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without a formal AUP, employees may be unaware of the expected standards for using company IT resources, internet, and email. This can lead to misuse of company assets, increased risk of malware infections, data leakage, and non-compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. An AUP provides clear guidelines and helps enforce security best practices among staff. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational policies</li><li>IT resource usage</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and sensitive data systems. This critical security control significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access even if primary credentials are compromised. Furthermore, the organization should develop and implement a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) to clearly define expectations for IT resource usage, ensuring employees understand their responsibilities in maintaining a secure environment. Regular review and communication of this policy are also crucial.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant security risks primarily due to the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems, and the absence of a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy. While the network scan data was limited, these organizational policy gaps represent critical vulnerabilities that could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and operational disruptions. Addressing these fundamental security controls is paramount to improving the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and readiness.</p>
