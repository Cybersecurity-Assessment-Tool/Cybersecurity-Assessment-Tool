            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network infrastructure exhibits several critical security gaps. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is not implemented for email access, computer logins, or sensitive data systems, leaving these crucial access points vulnerable to credential-based attacks. Furthermore, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct security awareness training for new employees, although annual training is provided for all staff. A specific technical vulnerability identified is an unencrypted web server, exposing data to potential interception.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Unencrypted Web Server",
                        "Overview": "An unencrypted web server was identified, with Port 80 found to be open. This exposes web traffic to potential eavesdropping and data interception, compromising the confidentiality and integrity of data transmitted over this port. The presence of an open, unencrypted port significantly increases the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks and data breaches.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Port 80"
                        ]

                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require MFA for accessing email, logging into computers, or accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access through compromised credentials, as a single password breach could grant an attacker full access to critical systems and data, leading to severe data breaches and operational disruption.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Email access",
                            "Computer logins",
                            "Sensitive data systems"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Inadequate Security Policies and Training",
                        "Overview": "The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. While annual training is provided, the absence of initial training and clear policy guidelines leaves new hires vulnerable to social engineering attacks and increases the likelihood of unintentional security lapses, potentially leading to data exposure or system compromise.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Employee behavior",
                            "Organizational policy",
                            "New employee onboarding process"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, to significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access. For the unencrypted web server, the immediate action should be to close Port 80 if it is not essential, or to implement SSL/TLS encryption for all web traffic to protect data in transit. Furthermore, the organization must develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy and introduce mandatory security awareness training for all new employees, complementing the existing annual training program. Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments should also be conducted to proactively identify and address emerging threats.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to a lack of fundamental security controls, particularly the absence of multi-factor authentication across critical systems and an unencrypted web server. While annual security awareness training is a positive step, the lack of an acceptable use policy and initial training for new employees creates additional vulnerabilities. Addressing these issues with the recommended mitigations is crucial to enhance the organization's overall security posture and readiness against cyber threats, thereby protecting sensitive data and maintaining operational integrity."
