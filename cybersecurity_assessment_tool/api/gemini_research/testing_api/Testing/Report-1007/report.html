        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network was scanned, revealing an open SSH port. Internally, the organization lacks fundamental security controls, including multi-factor authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, an acceptable use policy, and any form of security awareness training for employees. A critical vulnerability related to localhost exposure was also identified, indicating a severe internal system misconfiguration or exposure.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A critical vulnerability where internal services or sensitive information typically restricted to the local machine are exposed externally, potentially allowing unauthorized access to core system functionalities or data. This was identified through a high-severity alert from a security scan.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. Without MFA, email accounts are highly susceptible to credential stuffing, phishing, and brute-force attacks, leading to potential data breaches, business email compromise, and unauthorized access to sensitive communications. This was identified via organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. The absence of MFA for computer logins significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to internal systems if credentials are stolen or guessed, potentially leading to lateral movement, system compromise, and data exfiltration. This was identified via organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations</li><li>Servers</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH port (22) was detected on a public-facing host. While SSH is a legitimate service, an exposed port without robust security measures (e.g., strong authentication, IP restrictions, rate limiting) presents a significant attack surface for brute-force attacks, credential compromise, or exploitation of SSH vulnerabilities, potentially leading to remote code execution or unauthorized access. This was identified during the network scan.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with port 22 open</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks an employee acceptable use policy (AUP). Without a clear AUP, employees may not be aware of appropriate use of company resources, leading to potential misuse of IT assets, increased risk of data leakage, introduction of malware, and non-compliance with security best practices. This was identified via organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT assets</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No New Employee Security Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering attacks due to their unfamiliarity with company policies and security protocols. Without initial training, they are more likely to fall victim to phishing, malware, or other attacks, thereby introducing vulnerabilities into the organization's environment. This was identified via organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Annual Security Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. Regular security awareness training is crucial to keep employees informed about evolving cyber threats, company policies, and best practices. The lack of annual training increases the likelihood of employees making security mistakes, falling for social engineering, and inadvertently compromising organizational security. This was identified via organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, the organization should immediately address the critical localhost exposure. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and computer logins to significantly reduce the risk of credential-based attacks. Secure the open SSH port by implementing strong authentication (e.g., key-based authentication, MFA), restricting access to trusted IP addresses, and regularly patching the SSH server. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy (AUP) to clearly define appropriate conduct for IT resource usage. Furthermore, establish and maintain a robust security awareness training program, including mandatory training for all new employees and annual refresher training for all staff, to educate them on current threats and best security practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several significant cybersecurity risks, ranging from a critical localhost exposure and an open SSH port to fundamental deficiencies in security policies and employee training. The absence of MFA for email and computer logins represents a high-priority vulnerability that could lead to widespread compromise. Without an acceptable use policy and regular security awareness training, the human element remains a substantial weak point. Addressing these vulnerabilities systematically is crucial to improving the organization's overall security posture and readiness against evolving cyber threats.</p>
