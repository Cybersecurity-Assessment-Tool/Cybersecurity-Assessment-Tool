        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open HTTPS port (443) running Nginx version 1.18.0. While the network footprint appears minimal from the scan, an assessment of organizational policies indicates significant security gaps. Specifically, the organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access, computer logins, or sensitive data systems. Furthermore, there is no established employee acceptable use policy. On a positive note, the organization does conduct security awareness training for both new and all employees annually.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee inboxes if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. A single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to sensitive communications and potentially lead to further internal network penetration.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>User accounts</li><li>Employee communications</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication is not enforced for logging into organizational computers. This leaves workstations vulnerable to unauthorized access if employee passwords are stolen or guessed. Attackers could gain direct access to internal systems, data, and network resources, potentially leading to data breaches, malware infections, or lateral movement within the network.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations</li><li>Endpoints</li><li>User accounts</li><li>Internal network</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Access to sensitive data systems does not require Multi-Factor Authentication. This is a critical vulnerability as it means that a compromised single factor (e.g., a password) is sufficient to gain access to the organization's most valuable and confidential information. The impact of such a breach could be severe, including regulatory fines, reputational damage, and significant financial loss.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>Confidential information repositories</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks an Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). Without a formal AUP, employees may be unaware of the expected standards for using company IT resources, internet access, and data handling. This can lead to misuse of company assets, increased risk of malware introduction, data leakage, and potential legal or compliance issues due to undefined boundaries for employee conduct.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Organizational policy</li><li>Employee conduct</li><li>IT resources</li><li>Data handling practices</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Nginx Version - <span class="severity-Low">Low</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The web server identified is running Nginx version 1.18.0. While not immediately critical without specific CVEs, older software versions may contain known vulnerabilities that have been patched in newer releases. Running outdated software increases the attack surface and could expose the organization to exploits if unpatched vulnerabilities are discovered or targeted.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Web server (Nginx 1.18.0)</li><li>Public-facing services</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points. This includes enforcing MFA for email access, computer logins, and especially for all sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization should promptly develop and implement a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) to clearly define expectations for IT resource usage and data handling, ensuring all employees are trained on its contents. Regular patching and updating of all software, including the Nginx web server, should be a standard practice to mitigate risks associated with known vulnerabilities. While security awareness training is already in place, it should be continuously reinforced with specific emphasis on phishing prevention and the importance of MFA.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant security risks primarily due to the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication across key access points and the lack of a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy. These policy-level vulnerabilities create substantial opportunities for unauthorized access and data breaches, despite the positive practice of regular security awareness training. Addressing these fundamental gaps by implementing MFA and establishing clear usage policies is paramount to improving the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and protecting its assets from potential threats.</p>
