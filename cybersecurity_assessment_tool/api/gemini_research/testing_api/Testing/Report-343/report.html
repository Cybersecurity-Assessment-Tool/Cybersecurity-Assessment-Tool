        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a proactive stance on security awareness training and acceptable use policies. However, critical gaps exist in multi-factor authentication (MFA) implementation, particularly for email and sensitive data systems. A network scan also revealed an open SSH port, which, while not inherently a vulnerability, represents a potential attack vector if not adequately secured.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee inboxes through phishing attacks, credential stuffing, or brute-force attempts. Compromised email accounts can lead to business email compromise (BEC) scams, data exfiltration, and further lateral movement within the network. This was identified from the organizational data indicating "No" for MFA on email.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>All employee email accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not mandated for access to systems containing sensitive data. This poses a critical risk, as a single compromised credential could grant an attacker full access to confidential information, leading to severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, financial penalties, and significant reputational damage. This was identified from the organizational data indicating "No" for MFA on sensitive data systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All systems storing or processing sensitive organizational data (e.g., CRM, ERP, HR databases, financial systems)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port (Port 22) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A network scan identified an open SSH (Secure Shell) port (port 22) on an active host. While SSH is a legitimate protocol for secure remote access, an open port represents an exposed attack surface. Without robust security measures such as strong, unique passwords, key-based authentication, IP whitelisting, and rate limiting, this port could be vulnerable to brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or exploitation of unpatched SSH vulnerabilities, potentially leading to unauthorized remote access to the system. This was identified via the Nmap scan data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with open port 22</li><li>Network perimeter</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, starting immediately with email systems and sensitive data systems to significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access. For the identified open SSH port, ensure it is secured with strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., key-based authentication, disable password authentication), implement IP whitelisting, and consider changing the default port. Regularly review and patch SSH server software to mitigate known vulnerabilities. Continue with the existing security awareness training programs and acceptable use policies, reinforcing the importance of strong authentication practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization has a solid foundation in security awareness and policy enforcement. However, the absence of MFA for email and sensitive data systems represents critical security gaps that expose the organization to significant risks of data breaches and unauthorized access. The open SSH port also warrants immediate attention to ensure it is adequately secured. Addressing these vulnerabilities, particularly the MFA implementation, is paramount to enhancing the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and readiness against modern threats.</p>
