        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The provided network scan data indicates no active hosts or open ports, which is unusual and suggests either a highly locked-down environment or an incomplete scan. Further investigation into network topology and active assets is recommended for a comprehensive technical assessment. Based on organizational data, the company has some foundational security controls in place, including MFA for computer logins and an employee acceptable use policy. New employees receive security awareness training. However, critical gaps exist in multi-factor authentication implementation for email and sensitive data systems, and ongoing security awareness training is not conducted annually for all employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Email Account Security - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. Compromised email accounts can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and further network penetration. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational security posture questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>All employee email accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Sensitive Data System Security - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to log into sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are stolen or guessed. Attackers gaining access to these systems could lead to severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and significant financial and reputational damage. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational security posture questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Ongoing Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While the organization conducts security awareness training for new employees, it does not do so for all employees at least once per year. This leads to a degradation of security knowledge over time, making employees more susceptible to evolving social engineering tactics, phishing attempts, and other human-centric attacks. A lack of regular, updated training increases the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational security posture questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all email accounts and sensitive data systems immediately. This will drastically reduce the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials. Furthermore, establish a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees. This training should be comprehensive, updated regularly to reflect current threat landscapes, and designed to reinforce best practices for identifying and reporting cyber threats. Finally, a more thorough network discovery and scanning process should be conducted to accurately map the network infrastructure and identify any potential technical vulnerabilities that were not apparent in the initial scan data.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently exhibits a mixed state of cybersecurity readiness. While some foundational controls are present, critical vulnerabilities related to the absence of MFA for email and sensitive data systems, coupled with insufficient ongoing security awareness training, expose the organization to significant risks. Addressing these high and critical severity items is paramount to protecting sensitive data, preventing financial losses, and maintaining operational integrity against evolving cyber threats. A comprehensive approach combining technical controls and continuous employee education is essential for a robust security posture.</p>
