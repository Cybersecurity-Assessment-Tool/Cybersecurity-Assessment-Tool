        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to foundational security practices, with comprehensive implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, robust employee acceptable use policies are in place, complemented by regular security awareness training for all employees, including new hires. However, a network scan revealed an open MySQL port (3306), indicating a potential external exposure that could compromise the overall security posture.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network. This allows external entities to potentially connect to the database, which could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or service disruption if not properly secured. This vulnerability was identified via a network port scan.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified database exposure, it is recommended to immediately implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306 to only trusted IP addresses or internal networks. For a long-term solution, consider placing the database behind a VPN or implementing a secure bastion host for administrative access, further reducing its direct exposure to the internet.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization exhibits a commendable level of readiness in terms of internal security policies, MFA adoption, and security awareness training. However, the presence of an exposed MySQL database port represents a significant external vulnerability that could undermine these strong internal controls. Addressing this network exposure is critical to fortify the organization's defenses and ensure the integrity and confidentiality of its data.</p>
