        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's current security posture, based on the provided organizational data, indicates significant gaps in fundamental security controls, particularly concerning multi-factor authentication (MFA) and security awareness training. While MFA is required for email access, it is notably absent for computer logins and sensitive data systems, leaving critical assets vulnerable to credential-based attacks. Furthermore, the complete lack of an employee acceptable use policy and any form of security awareness training (for new hires or annually for all employees) suggests a high risk from human-centric threats and a lack of clear security guidelines. Due to broken network scan data and current risks input, a comprehensive technical vulnerability assessment of the network infrastructure could not be performed.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for employees to log into their computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if employee credentials are stolen or compromised through phishing, malware, or other means. Without a second factor, a malicious actor only needs a username and password to gain access to internal systems, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, and lateral movement within the network. This was identified directly from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers</li><li>Internal network access points</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk, as compromised credentials could grant direct access to confidential, proprietary, or regulated data. A breach of these systems could result in severe financial penalties, reputational damage, loss of intellectual property, and legal liabilities. This vulnerability was identified from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases containing critical information</li><li>Cloud storage for sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without a clear AUP, employees may be unaware of their responsibilities regarding the use of company IT resources, data handling, and internet usage. This can lead to risky behaviors, increased exposure to malware, data leakage, and potential legal or compliance issues. It also makes it difficult to enforce security standards and hold employees accountable for their actions. This was identified from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>IT infrastructure</li><li>Legal and compliance posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) as they may be less familiar with company policies, procedures, and common threat indicators. This lack of initial training leaves the organization vulnerable to human error-induced breaches from the moment an employee joins. This was identified from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Email systems</li><li>Internal network</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Annual Security Awareness Training for All Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. Without regular training, employees may become complacent, forget best practices, or remain unaware of evolving cyber threats (e.g., new phishing techniques, ransomware variants). This significantly increases the likelihood of employees falling victim to attacks, thereby compromising organizational security. This was identified from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Email systems</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, immediate action is required across several key areas. Firstly, implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and access to sensitive data systems. This critical step will drastically reduce the risk of unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised. Secondly, develop and enforce a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) to clearly define expectations for IT resource usage and data handling. Thirdly, establish a robust security awareness training program. This program should include mandatory training for all new employees upon onboarding and annual refresher training for all existing employees to keep them informed about current threats and best practices. These measures will address the identified human and access control vulnerabilities, creating a more resilient security environment.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to insufficient implementation of fundamental security controls related to access management and human factors. The absence of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, coupled with a complete lack of security awareness training and an acceptable use policy, leaves the organization highly susceptible to credential theft, social engineering, and insider threats. While a comprehensive technical network assessment was not possible due to broken input, the identified organizational vulnerabilities indicate a low state of readiness against common and impactful cyberattacks. Addressing these foundational gaps is paramount to improving the overall security posture and reducing the likelihood of a successful breach.</p>
