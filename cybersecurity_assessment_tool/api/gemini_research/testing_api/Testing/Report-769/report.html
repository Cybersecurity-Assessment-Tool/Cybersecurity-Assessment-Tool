        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The network scan identified an Nginx web server (version 1.18.0) running on port 443, indicating a public-facing web service. While the network scan did not reveal immediate critical technical vulnerabilities, the organization's internal security posture, as revealed by the provided data, indicates significant gaps in fundamental security controls and employee training.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. Compromised email accounts can lead to further internal network breaches, data exfiltration, and business email compromise (BEC) scams. This was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee email accounts</li><li>Email server infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if user credentials are stolen or guessed. An attacker gaining access to a computer can then move laterally within the network, access sensitive data, or deploy malware. This was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All organizational computers</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This is a critical vulnerability as it means that a single compromised password could grant an attacker direct access to the organization's most valuable and confidential information. The impact could include data breaches, regulatory fines, reputational damage, and intellectual property theft. This was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All systems containing sensitive data</li><li>User accounts with access to sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) as they may be less familiar with the organization's security policies, common threats, and reporting procedures. This increases the likelihood of successful attacks that leverage human error. This was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Annual Security Awareness Training for All Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. Regular training is crucial to keep employees informed about evolving threats, reinforce best practices, and maintain a strong security culture. Without it, employees may become complacent or unaware of new attack vectors, increasing the risk of human-factor incidents. This was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>The organization must prioritize the immediate implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, including email, computer logins, and especially sensitive data systems, to significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials. Concurrently, a comprehensive security awareness training program should be established. This program must include mandatory training for all new employees upon onboarding and annual refresher training for all existing staff to ensure a consistent understanding of current threats and best security practices. While not an immediate vulnerability, regular vulnerability scanning and patch management for the Nginx server (version 1.18.0) and other network assets are also recommended to address potential software vulnerabilities and maintain a strong security posture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant security risks primarily due to a lack of fundamental security controls, specifically the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication across critical access points and a complete lack of security awareness training for both new and existing employees. While a public-facing Nginx web server was identified, the most pressing vulnerabilities stem from human and access management weaknesses. Addressing these foundational issues is paramount to improving the overall security posture and readiness against common cyber threats and should be prioritized immediately.</p>
