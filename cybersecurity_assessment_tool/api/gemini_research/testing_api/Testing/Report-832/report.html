        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and conducting annual security awareness training for all employees. However, significant gaps exist in critical areas, particularly concerning authentication for internal systems and the establishment of foundational security policies. The network scan data provided was minimal, indicating no open ports on the scanned host, which is a positive sign, but the organizational data reveals several high-impact human and policy-related vulnerabilities that require immediate attention.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Authentication for Workstations - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for employees to log into their computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised through phishing, keyloggers, or brute-force attacks. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's workstation and potentially the internal network. This was identified through the organizational survey data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Internal network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Authentication for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not enforced for accessing sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk, as compromised credentials (e.g., via phishing or data breaches) could allow unauthorized individuals to access, exfiltrate, or tamper with sensitive organizational data. The absence of this crucial security layer makes these systems highly vulnerable to credential-based attacks. This was identified through the organizational survey data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All systems containing sensitive organizational data</li><li>Databases</li><li>File shares</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. This absence means there are no clear guidelines for employees regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, internet access, email, and data handling. This can lead to increased risks of data leakage, malware infections, non-compliance with regulations, and general misuse of company assets, as employees may unknowingly engage in insecure practices. This was identified through the organizational survey data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Onboarding Security Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive dedicated security awareness training upon joining the organization. While annual training is conducted for all employees, the initial period for new hires is critical for establishing secure habits and understanding organizational security policies. Without immediate training, new employees are more susceptible to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing), may mishandle sensitive information, or inadvertently introduce security risks due to unfamiliarity with company protocols. This was identified through the organizational survey data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network security</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and, critically, for all sensitive data systems. This will significantly enhance protection against credential theft. Furthermore, a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy should be developed and formally implemented, clearly outlining expectations for IT resource usage and data handling. Finally, a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees should be established as part of their onboarding process to ensure they are equipped with essential security knowledge from day one, complementing the existing annual training.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant security vulnerabilities primarily stemming from a lack of robust authentication mechanisms for internal systems and an absence of critical security policies and initial employee training. While some security measures are in place (MFA for email, annual training), the gaps identified expose the organization to high risks of unauthorized access, data breaches, and misuse of resources. Addressing these vulnerabilities through the recommended actions is crucial for improving the overall security posture and readiness against common cyber threats.</p>
