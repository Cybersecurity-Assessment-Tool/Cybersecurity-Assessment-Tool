        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization currently utilizes Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, and has an employee acceptable use policy in place. However, critical vulnerabilities were identified, including an outdated operating system (Windows 7) on workstations and an FTP server (vsftpd 2.3.4) allowing anonymous login. A significant gap in the security posture is the complete absence of security awareness training for both new and existing employees, which increases the organization's susceptibility to human-factor risks.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Anonymous FTP Login Allowed - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The FTP server, identified as vsftpd version 2.3.4, is configured to allow anonymous login on port 21. This configuration permits unauthorized users to access the server without credentials, potentially leading to data leakage, unauthorized file uploads, or further system compromise if write permissions are misconfigured. This vulnerability was identified through an Nmap scan utilizing the 'ftp-anon' script.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>FTP Server (vsftpd 2.3.4)</li><li>Port 21</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees, nor does it provide annual training for all employees. This critical gap leaves the workforce vulnerable to social engineering attacks, phishing attempts, and other human-centric exploits, as employees may lack the knowledge to identify and respond to common cybersecurity threats. This significantly elevates the overall risk of a successful breach.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All Employees</li><li>Organizational Security Posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Windows Policy - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A significant number of workstations are running Windows 7. Windows 7 has reached its end-of-life (EOL) and no longer receives security updates or patches from Microsoft. This exposes these systems to known and newly discovered vulnerabilities, making them highly susceptible to exploitation by malicious actors and significantly increasing the risk of system compromise and data breaches.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations running Windows 7</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately disable anonymous FTP access on the vsftpd server and enforce strong authentication for all FTP users; consider migrating to more secure protocols like SFTP or FTPS. Furthermore, a comprehensive security awareness training program must be implemented, including mandatory training for all new hires and annual refresher courses for all employees, covering topics such as phishing, social engineering, and data handling best practices. Crucially, all workstations running Windows 7 must be upgraded to a currently supported operating system (e.g., Windows 10 or 11) to ensure they receive critical security updates and patches, potentially requiring hardware refreshes.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has implemented MFA for key access points and an acceptable use policy, several critical vulnerabilities significantly undermine its overall security posture. The presence of an anonymous FTP server, widespread use of an end-of-life operating system, and a complete lack of security awareness training create substantial entry points and increase the likelihood of a successful cyberattack. Addressing these high-severity risks immediately is paramount to improving the organization's cybersecurity readiness and protecting its assets.</p>
