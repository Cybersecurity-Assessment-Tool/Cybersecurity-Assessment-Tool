        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to identity and access management by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. Network scanning indicates that common unencrypted web server ports (like port 80) are closed, suggesting a baseline level of network hardening. However, significant gaps exist in foundational security policies and ongoing employee education. Specifically, there is no formal employee acceptable use policy, and security awareness training is not conducted annually for all employees, leaving the organization vulnerable to human-factor risks and inconsistent security practices.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. This absence means there are no clear guidelines for employees regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, internet, email, and data. This can lead to misuse of company assets, increased risk of data breaches, exposure to malware, and potential legal liabilities due to unmanaged employee behavior. The lack of such a policy was identified through organizational data review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational IT assets</li><li>Sensitive data</li><li>Legal and compliance posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct this training annually for all employees. This oversight means that existing employees may not be updated on the latest cyber threats, best practices, or changes in organizational security policies. This significantly increases the risk of successful phishing attacks, social engineering attempts, and other human-factor vulnerabilities, as employee knowledge and vigilance can degrade over time. This was identified through organizational data review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li><li>Email systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To enhance the organization's security posture, it is recommended to address the identified policy and training gaps. Firstly, develop and implement a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy that clearly outlines expectations for the use of company resources, data handling, and internet conduct. Ensure this policy is communicated to all employees and acknowledged. Secondly, establish a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees, not just new hires. This training should cover current threat landscapes, phishing recognition, data protection best practices, and the importance of adhering to organizational security policies. Regular training will help maintain a high level of security awareness and reduce the likelihood of human-induced security incidents.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization has a commendable foundation in access control through widespread MFA implementation. However, its overall security readiness is hampered by critical deficiencies in its security culture and governance. The absence of an acceptable use policy and the lack of recurring security awareness training for all employees represent significant vulnerabilities that could lead to operational disruptions, data loss, or compliance issues. Addressing these policy and training gaps is crucial for fostering a robust security culture and mitigating risks associated with human factors, thereby improving the organization's resilience against evolving cyber threats.</p>
