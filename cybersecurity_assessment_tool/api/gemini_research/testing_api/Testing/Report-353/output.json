            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to foundational security practices, including mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, comprehensive security awareness training is conducted for all employees, both new hires and annually, complemented by an established acceptable use policy. Despite these robust internal controls, a network scan identified an open Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) port (3389) exposing the 'ms-wbt-server' service, which presents a critical external attack surface.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "RDP Exposure",
                        "Overview": "Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed to the internet, allowing potential attackers to attempt brute-force attacks or exploit vulnerabilities in the RDP service to gain unauthorized access to internal systems. The impact could range from unauthorized access to data exfiltration or complete system compromise. This vulnerability was identified through a network scan showing port 3389 open and the 'ms-wbt-server' service running.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "IP"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the critical risk of RDP exposure, it is strongly recommended to immediately close port 3389 to external access. For long-term secure remote access, implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution, ensuring all RDP connections are routed through the VPN, adding an essential layer of security and authentication.",
            "Conclusion": "While the organization has established robust security policies and training, the presence of an externally exposed RDP service represents a critical vulnerability that significantly undermines the overall security posture. Addressing this RDP exposure is paramount to prevent potential unauthorized access and maintain the integrity of the network, despite the otherwise strong security awareness and access control measures."
