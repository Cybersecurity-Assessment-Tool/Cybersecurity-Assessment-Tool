        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently presents several critical security vulnerabilities. A scan identified an active FTP service (vsftpd 2.3.4) allowing anonymous login, which poses an immediate and severe risk of unauthorized data access or modification. Furthermore, the organization's internal policies reveal significant gaps in foundational security practices, including the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems, a lack of an employee acceptable use policy, and no regular security awareness training for staff. Existing vulnerabilities also include workstations running an outdated and unsupported operating system (Windows 7). Collectively, these issues indicate a low level of security readiness and a high susceptibility to various cyber threats.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Anonymous FTP Access - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The FTP service (vsftpd 2.3.4) on a detected host allows anonymous login. This critical misconfiguration enables unauthorized users to access and potentially modify files on the FTP server without requiring any credentials. This significantly increases the risk of data breaches, unauthorized data manipulation, and could serve as an initial access point for further system compromise. The vsftpd 2.3.4 version is also outdated and known to have security vulnerabilities.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>FTP Server (port 21)</li><li>vsftpd 2.3.4</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Windows Policy - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Several computers within the organization are running Windows 7. This operating system has reached its end-of-life and no longer receives security updates or patches from Microsoft. Consequently, these systems are exposed to known and newly discovered vulnerabilities, making them highly susceptible to malware, exploits, and other cyberattacks, which can lead to data loss, system compromise, or network-wide infections.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This leaves employee email accounts vulnerable to compromise through common attack vectors such as phishing, brute-force attacks, or stolen credentials. A successful compromise of an email account can lead to business email compromise (BEC) scams, data exfiltration, or serve as a pivot point to access other internal systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to log into sensitive data systems. This critical security gap means that if an attacker obtains a user's password, they can gain direct access to sensitive organizational data without any additional authentication challenge. This significantly elevates the risk of data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and severe reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines, employees may inadvertently or intentionally misuse company IT resources, access inappropriate content, or engage in risky online behaviors. This increases the likelihood of security incidents, data leakage, and potential legal or compliance issues due to undefined boundaries for technology usage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>IT resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees, nor does it provide annual training for all staff. This leaves employees unprepared to identify and respond to common cyber threats such as phishing emails, social engineering attempts, and malware. A lack of human firewall significantly increases the organization's susceptibility to attacks that exploit human error, making employees a primary weak point in the security posture.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, immediate action is required across several fronts. Firstly, the anonymous FTP access must be disabled immediately, and if FTP functionality is essential, it should be replaced with a secure protocol like SFTP or SCP, ensuring strong authentication is enforced and the vsftpd service is updated to a current, supported version. Secondly, all workstations running Windows 7 must be prioritized for upgrade to a currently supported operating system (e.g., Windows 10 or 11) to ensure they receive critical security updates. If immediate upgrades are not feasible, these systems should be isolated from the main network and compensating controls implemented. Thirdly, mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be implemented for all email accounts and sensitive data systems to significantly enhance credential security. Fourthly, the organization must develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to guide proper IT resource usage. Finally, a robust security awareness training program should be established, including mandatory training for all new hires and annual refresher courses for all employees, to cultivate a security-conscious culture and empower staff to recognize and report threats.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The current cybersecurity assessment reveals that the organization faces a high level of risk due to critical vulnerabilities in both its technical infrastructure and organizational policies. The presence of anonymous FTP access, outdated operating systems, and a significant lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for key systems, combined with absent security policies and training, creates an environment highly susceptible to data breaches, unauthorized access, and operational disruption. Addressing these issues with urgency and implementing the recommended security enhancements is paramount to improving the organization's security posture and overall readiness against evolving cyber threats.</p>
