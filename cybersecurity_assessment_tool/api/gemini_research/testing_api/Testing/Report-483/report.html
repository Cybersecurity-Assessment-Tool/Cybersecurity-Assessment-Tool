        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes a MySQL database (version 5.7.33) on port 3306. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required for computer logins, it is notably absent for email access and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not provide security awareness training for new employees, although annual training is conducted for all existing employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network, potentially exposing sensitive database content to unauthorized access. This was identified via network scanning, showing MySQL version 5.7.33 running on this port.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access email. This significantly increases the risk of email account compromise through phishing or brute-force attacks, potentially leading to business email compromise (BEC) or data exfiltration. This policy gap was identified from organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email access systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised, increasing the risk of data breaches and compliance violations, especially given the presence of an exposed database. This policy gap was identified from organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. This absence means there are no clear guidelines for employees regarding appropriate use of company resources, data handling, and internet usage, increasing the risk of accidental data leakage, malware introduction, or other security incidents due to unguided employee actions. This policy gap was identified from organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Organizational policies</li><li>Employee behavior</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive mandatory security awareness training upon onboarding. This leaves new hires susceptible to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) and unaware of critical security protocols, making them potential entry points for attackers during their initial period. This policy gap was identified from organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employee onboarding process</li><li>Employee knowledge</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement strict firewall rules to restrict external access to port 3306, ideally placing the MySQL database behind a VPN or within a more isolated network segment for long-term security. Crucially, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be enforced for all email access and sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised. The organization should also develop and immediately implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to guide appropriate conduct and data handling. Furthermore, mandatory security awareness training should be introduced for all new employees during their onboarding process to ensure they are equipped with essential security knowledge from day one. Continuing the annual security awareness training for all employees is also vital for maintaining a strong security posture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several significant cybersecurity vulnerabilities, including an exposed database and critical gaps in Multi-Factor Authentication implementation for email and sensitive data systems. Policy deficiencies, such as the lack of an acceptable use policy and initial security training for new hires, further exacerbate the risk profile. While annual security training is a positive step, these unaddressed vulnerabilities indicate a moderate to high readiness gap, requiring immediate attention and strategic security enhancements to protect sensitive data and prevent potential breaches.</p>
