        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization currently enforces Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, which is a positive security measure. An acceptable use policy is also in place. However, significant gaps exist in protecting sensitive data systems and in employee security awareness training. There is no MFA requirement for accessing sensitive data systems, and both initial training for new employees and annual refresher training for all employees are absent. The provided network scan data and current risks did not identify any technical vulnerabilities.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to systems containing sensitive data. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or other means. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to sensitive information, leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and reputational damage. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on sensitive data systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees are not provided with initial security awareness training. This leaves them vulnerable to common social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) and unaware of organizational security policies and best practices from the start. This lack of foundational knowledge can lead to inadvertent security breaches, policy violations, and a higher risk of falling victim to cyberattacks, potentially compromising organizational data or systems. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for security awareness training for new employees.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>Organizational data susceptible to social engineering</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Regular Security Awareness Training for All Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This means employees may not be updated on new threats, evolving attack vectors, or changes in organizational security policies. Over time, security knowledge degrades, increasing susceptibility to various cyber threats, including phishing, malware, and insider threats. This ongoing lack of education can lead to a higher incidence of security incidents across the entire workforce. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for annual security awareness training.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data susceptible to social engineering and human error</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems immediately. This will significantly enhance protection against unauthorized access even if primary credentials are compromised. Furthermore, a comprehensive security awareness training program should be established. This program must include mandatory initial training for all new employees to ensure they understand security policies and best practices from day one. Additionally, annual refresher training for all employees is crucial to keep them informed about evolving threats and maintain a strong security posture across the organization. Regular training helps reinforce security best practices and reduces the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has implemented MFA for email and computer logins and has an acceptable use policy, there are critical vulnerabilities related to sensitive data protection and employee security awareness. The absence of MFA for sensitive data systems poses a high risk of data breaches, and the lack of both initial and recurring security awareness training leaves the entire workforce susceptible to social engineering and other human-factor threats. Addressing these areas is paramount to improving the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and reducing its attack surface.</p>
