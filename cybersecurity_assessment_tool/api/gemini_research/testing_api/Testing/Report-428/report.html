        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open port 80, indicating a potentially active web server. Internally, the organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and sensitive data systems, and has an acceptable use policy. However, a critical gap exists in email security, as MFA is not required for email access. Furthermore, the organization lacks comprehensive security awareness training for both new and existing employees, leaving a significant human factor vulnerability.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unsecured Web Server (Port 80 Open) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An Nmap scan identified an open port 80, indicating an active web server accessible from the network. Without proper security configurations, regular patching, and potentially a shift to HTTPS, this service could be vulnerable to various web-based attacks, including cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, directory traversal, or denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Such vulnerabilities could lead to unauthorized data access, website defacement, or serve as an entry point for further network compromise.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li><li>Web Server</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly elevates the risk of email account compromise through common attack vectors such as phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. A compromised email account can lead to business email compromise (BEC) scams, data exfiltration, unauthorized access to other linked services, and reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>User accounts</li><li>Sensitive communications</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks a structured security awareness training program for new employees and does not conduct annual training for all staff. This absence creates a significant human factor vulnerability, making employees more susceptible to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, malware delivery via email, vishing). A lack of awareness can lead to inadvertent disclosure of sensitive information, execution of malicious software, or bypassing security policies, thereby increasing the likelihood and impact of security incidents.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts to mitigate the risk of account compromise. Furthermore, a comprehensive security awareness training program should be established, including mandatory training for all new hires and annual refreshers for all employees, to educate staff on common threats and best practices. Regarding the open port 80, a thorough review of the web server configuration is crucial, ensuring all services are patched, securely configured, and ideally, transitioned to HTTPS to encrypt traffic and prevent eavesdropping. If the service is not essential, it should be disabled.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates some foundational security practices with MFA for computer logins and sensitive data, along with an acceptable use policy. However, significant vulnerabilities exist, particularly concerning email security due to the lack of MFA, and a critical gap in human-factor defenses due to the absence of regular security awareness training. The presence of an open port 80 also warrants immediate attention. Addressing these high-severity risks is paramount to improving the overall cybersecurity readiness and protecting against common attack vectors.</p>
