        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan reveals a minimal external footprint with only SSH (port 22) detected as open. Internally, the organization has a strong foundation with an employee acceptable use policy and consistent security awareness training for both new and existing employees. However, a significant gap exists in the implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. This lack of MFA significantly elevates the risk of unauthorized access through credential-based attacks.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for email access. This leaves email accounts highly vulnerable to phishing, credential stuffing, and brute-force attacks. A compromised email account can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and serve as a pivot point for further network penetration. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating no MFA for email.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>User email accounts</li><li>Email gateways</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MFA is not required for logging into computers within the organization. This exposes workstations and servers to unauthorized access if user credentials are stolen or guessed. Attackers can gain initial access to internal systems, potentially leading to lateral movement, data theft, or malware deployment. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating no MFA for computer logins.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All organizational computers (workstations, servers)</li><li>User accounts</li><li>Active Directory/LDAP systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce MFA for access to sensitive data systems. This is a critical vulnerability, as a single compromised credential could grant an attacker full access to highly confidential information. The impact could include severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, significant financial penalties, and severe reputational damage. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating no MFA for sensitive data systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems (databases, file servers, CRM, ERP)</li><li>Critical business applications</li><li>User accounts with access to sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port (22) on Network Perimeter - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH port (22) was detected on the network perimeter. While SSH is essential for remote administration, it represents a potential attack vector if not adequately secured. Attackers may attempt brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or exploit known vulnerabilities in the SSH service to gain unauthorized remote access to internal systems. This was identified via the Nmap scan data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Network perimeter</li><li>SSH server</li><li>Systems accessible via SSH</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, immediate implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is paramount. MFA should be enforced for all email access, computer logins, and critically, for all sensitive data systems. For the open SSH port, it is recommended to implement strong security measures such as disabling root login, using SSH key-based authentication instead of passwords, implementing rate limiting, regularly patching the SSH server, and considering changing the default SSH port to a non-standard one. Furthermore, ensure robust logging and monitoring are in place for all SSH access attempts. Regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing should be conducted to identify and address any new or emerging risks.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a commendable commitment to security awareness training and policy development. However, the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication across email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems presents critical vulnerabilities that could lead to severe security incidents. The open SSH port also requires diligent security practices. Addressing these MFA gaps and securing the SSH service should be the immediate priorities to mitigate the most significant risks and improve the overall cybersecurity readiness of the organization.</p>
