        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open port 22 (SSH). While security awareness training is conducted for new and existing employees annually, several critical security controls are missing. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is not required for email access or computer logins, significantly increasing the risk of unauthorized access through compromised credentials. Furthermore, the absence of an employee acceptable use policy (AUP) leaves the organization vulnerable to misuse of IT resources and potential legal liabilities. A critical vulnerability related to localhost exposure was also identified.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A critical vulnerability has been identified where a service intended for local access is exposed to the network. This could allow unauthorized external access to internal resources, leading to data breaches or system compromise. The high CVSS score indicates severe impact and ease of exploitation.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks and enhance the organization's security posture, several key recommendations are provided. Firstly, immediately investigate and remediate the "Localhost Exposed" vulnerability to prevent unauthorized access to internal services. Secondly, implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and computer logins to significantly reduce the risk of credential-based attacks. Thirdly, develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy (AUP) to clearly define expectations for IT resource usage and minimize insider threats. Regularly review and update security configurations, especially for services exposed to the network like SSH (port 22), to ensure they adhere to the principle of least privilege and are hardened against common attack vectors.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces critical security vulnerabilities, primarily stemming from an exposed localhost service and a lack of fundamental security controls such as MFA for email and computer logins, and an acceptable use policy. While security awareness training is a positive step, these gaps significantly increase the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and system compromise. Addressing these issues promptly is paramount to improving the overall security readiness and protecting organizational assets.</p>
