        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open HTTP port (80), which could expose services to potential attacks if not properly secured. Furthermore, the organization exhibits several critical gaps in its security posture, including a lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems, and the absence of an employee acceptable use policy. While new employees receive security awareness training, annual recurring training for all employees is not conducted, leaving a significant gap in ongoing security education.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open HTTP Port (80) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open HTTP port (80) was identified during the network scan. This port is commonly used for unencrypted web traffic. If a web server or application is running on this port without proper security configurations (e.g., redirection to HTTPS, strong access controls, up-to-date software), it could be vulnerable to various attacks such as information disclosure, man-in-the-middle attacks, or exploitation of known web application vulnerabilities. The impact could range from data interception to full system compromise.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li><li>Web server/application (if present)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. If an attacker gains access to an employee's email, they could potentially launch further attacks, impersonate the employee, access sensitive information, or reset passwords for other services.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are compromised. Attackers could gain direct access to confidential information, intellectual property, or customer data, leading to severe data breaches, regulatory fines, and reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Employee accounts with access to sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without a clear AUP, employees may be unaware of their responsibilities regarding the use of company IT resources, data handling, and internet usage. This can lead to increased risks of insider threats, data leakage, malware infections from unauthorized software installations or website visits, and non-compliance with industry regulations.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Data handling procedures</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Recurring Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This means that employees may not be kept up-to-date on the latest threats, best practices, and organizational policies. Over time, initial training knowledge can fade, and new threats emerge, increasing the likelihood of employees falling victim to social engineering attacks, phishing, or making security-related errors.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and sensitive data systems to significantly reduce the risk of credential compromise. For the open HTTP port (80), investigate the service running on it, ensure it is necessary, and if so, secure it by implementing HTTPS with strong TLS configurations, applying necessary patches, and restricting access where possible. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy (AUP) to clearly define expected behavior regarding IT resource usage and data handling. Furthermore, establish a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees to ensure continuous education on evolving threats and best security practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to critical gaps in Multi-Factor Authentication implementation for email and sensitive data systems, an open HTTP port, and a lack of foundational security policies like an acceptable use policy. While initial security training for new hires is a positive step, the absence of recurring annual training leaves the workforce vulnerable to evolving threats. Addressing these vulnerabilities is crucial for enhancing the organization's overall security posture and readiness against potential cyberattacks.</p>
