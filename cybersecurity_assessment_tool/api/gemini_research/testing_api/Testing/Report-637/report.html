        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open HTTPS port (443) running Nginx version 1.18.0. This version is outdated and no longer receives security updates, posing a significant risk. Furthermore, the organizational data indicates critical gaps in security posture, specifically the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and computer logins. While MFA is used for sensitive data systems and new employees receive security awareness training, there is no acceptable use policy in place, and annual security awareness training for all employees is not conducted. These deficiencies highlight a need for immediate attention to both technical vulnerabilities and foundational security policies.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Nginx Web Server - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Nginx version 1.18.0 is outdated and no longer receives security updates. This exposes the web server to known vulnerabilities that could lead to data breaches, denial of service, or unauthorized access. The presence of this version was identified through a network scan on port 443.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Web server (Nginx 1.18.0 on port 443)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for email access. This significantly increases the risk of email account compromise through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks. A compromised email account can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and serve as a pivot point for further network penetration. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee email accounts</li><li>Email server</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for computer logins. This leaves internal systems vulnerable to unauthorized access if credentials are stolen, guessed, or phished. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker access to an employee's workstation and potentially facilitate lateral movement within the network, increasing the risk of data breaches and system compromise. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Internal network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This absence means there are no clear, documented guidelines for employees regarding the proper and secure use of company IT resources, including internet, email, and software. This increases the risk of misuse, unintentional data leakage, non-compliance with security best practices, and makes it harder to address insider threats. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee-facing IT systems</li><li>Organizational data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, there is no annual training for all employees. This gap means employees may not be regularly updated on evolving cyber threats, company policies, and best practices. Over time, this can lead to a degradation of security awareness, increasing the likelihood of employees falling victim to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) or making security errors that could compromise organizational data and systems. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>IT systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to upgrade the Nginx web server to the latest stable and supported version to ensure all known vulnerabilities are patched. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all employee email accounts and for all computer logins to significantly enhance protection against credential theft. Develop and enforce a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) to establish clear guidelines for the secure and appropriate use of company IT resources. Finally, establish and conduct mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees to ensure they are continuously updated on current cyber threats and best security practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks stemming from outdated software and critical deficiencies in its security policies and practices. The lack of MFA for email and computer logins, coupled with an outdated web server, presents immediate and severe threats to data integrity and system availability. While some security measures are in place, the absence of an acceptable use policy and annual security training indicates a reactive rather than proactive security posture. Addressing these vulnerabilities and implementing the recommended controls is crucial for improving the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and resilience against evolving threats.</p>
