        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Based on the provided organizational data, the network's security posture indicates a mixed level of readiness. While the organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and sensitive data systems, critical gaps exist in email security, employee policy enforcement, and ongoing security awareness training. The absence of network scan data or specific system vulnerabilities limits a comprehensive technical assessment, but the policy-level information highlights significant areas for improvement in foundational cybersecurity practices.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. Email accounts are frequently targeted by phishing attacks and credential stuffing. Without MFA, a compromised password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's email, leading to further internal phishing, data exfiltration, or business email compromise (BEC) attacks. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee email accounts</li><li>Email server/service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. An AUP defines the proper use of company assets, networks, and data by employees. Without clear guidelines, employees may inadvertently engage in risky behaviors, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive information, leading to security incidents, data loss, or legal liabilities. This creates an environment where security best practices are not formally enforced or understood.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company network</li><li>Company assets (computers, mobile devices)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Recurring Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. Cybersecurity threats evolve constantly, and without regular updates and refreshers, employees may forget best practices or become unaware of new attack vectors (e.g., new phishing techniques, social engineering tactics). This increases the likelihood of employees falling victim to attacks, thereby compromising organizational security.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access to significantly reduce the risk of email account compromise. Furthermore, a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) should be developed, communicated, and enforced across the entire organization to establish clear guidelines for the secure use of company resources. Finally, a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees should be established and regularly updated to ensure that staff remain informed about current threats and best practices, reinforcing a strong security culture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, and providing initial security awareness training for new hires. However, critical vulnerabilities exist due to the absence of MFA for email, a formal acceptable use policy, and ongoing, annual security awareness training for all staff. Addressing these policy and procedural gaps is crucial for enhancing the overall security posture, reducing the attack surface, and fostering a more resilient cybersecurity environment against evolving threats.</p>
