        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing MFA for email access and maintaining an acceptable use policy. Annual security awareness training is also conducted for all employees. However, significant vulnerabilities exist, particularly concerning authentication for critical systems and the onboarding process for new employees. The network scan identified an open SSH port, which, if not properly secured, could serve as an entry point for attackers. The absence of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems represents a critical gap in the organization's defense-in-depth strategy, leaving these assets highly susceptible to credential-based attacks. Furthermore, the lack of security awareness training for new employees creates an initial period of heightened risk where new hires may be more vulnerable to social engineering tactics.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port (22) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A network scan identified an open SSH port (22) on a host. While SSH is a secure protocol for remote access, an open port represents a potential attack surface. If not adequately secured with strong authentication, rate limiting, and regular patching, this port could be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to the system, potentially leading to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further lateral movement within the network. The impact could range from service disruption to full system control.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 22</li><li>Network perimeter</li><li>Host with open SSH port</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly elevates the risk of unauthorized access to employee workstations and internal systems. In the event of compromised credentials (e.g., through phishing, malware, or brute-force attacks), an attacker could gain full access to an employee's computer without needing a second authentication factor, leading to potential data theft, malware deployment, or lateral movement within the network.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>User accounts</li><li>Authentication systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive information. If an attacker obtains credentials for these systems, they can directly access, modify, or exfiltrate critical data without an additional layer of security. This vulnerability could lead to severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, significant financial penalties, and severe reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>Cloud storage</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees, new employees do not receive specific training upon onboarding. This creates a period of vulnerability where new hires may not be fully aware of the organization's security policies, common threats (like phishing and social engineering), and best practices. This lack of initial training increases the likelihood of new employees falling victim to attacks, potentially compromising organizational systems or data before they have developed a strong security posture.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security culture</li><li>Email systems (phishing)</li><li>Internal communication channels</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and, critically, for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised. The open SSH port (22) should be secured by ensuring strong, unique passwords or SSH keys are used, disabling root login, implementing IP-based access restrictions, and regularly patching the SSH server. Furthermore, a comprehensive security awareness training program should be established for all new employees as part of their onboarding process, covering common threats, organizational policies, and best practices to mitigate human-factor risks from day one. Regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing should also be conducted to identify and address emerging threats.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently exhibits a mixed security posture. While some foundational elements like MFA for email and an acceptable use policy are in place, critical vulnerabilities exist due to the absence of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, an open SSH port, and a gap in security awareness training for new employees. These weaknesses significantly increase the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and system compromise. Addressing these identified risks with the recommended mitigations is crucial to strengthen the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and protect its valuable assets.</p>
