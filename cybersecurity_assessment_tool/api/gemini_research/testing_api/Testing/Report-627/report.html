        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization currently utilizes Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and computer logins, and has an employee acceptable use policy in place, indicating a foundational level of security awareness. However, a critical gap exists as MFA is not required for accessing sensitive data systems. Furthermore, while new employees receive security awareness training, annual training for all employees is not consistently conducted. A network scan identified an open MySQL port (3306), which could expose database services.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network, potentially exposing database services to unauthorized access. This could lead to data breaches, unauthorized data modification, or denial of service if exploited. This vulnerability was identified via network port scanning.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical data if credentials are compromised through phishing, keylogging, or brute-force attacks. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant full access to sensitive information. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User authentication mechanisms</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. This leaves employees vulnerable to evolving social engineering tactics, phishing attacks, and general cybersecurity threats, increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents. Regular, comprehensive training is crucial for maintaining a strong 'human firewall' and an informed workforce. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li><li>Human element of security</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from necessary internal IP addresses or specific trusted hosts. For long-term security, consider placing the database behind a VPN or using secure tunnels for remote access. Crucially, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be implemented and enforced for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised. Additionally, establish and enforce a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees, covering current threats, best practices for password management, phishing identification, data handling, and incident reporting procedures. The existing MFA for email and computer logins, along with the acceptable use policy, should be maintained and regularly reviewed.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates some foundational security practices, such as MFA for email and computer logins, and an acceptable use policy. However, critical vulnerabilities exist, including an exposed MySQL port, the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems, and a lack of consistent annual security awareness training for all employees. These gaps significantly increase the risk of data breaches and successful cyberattacks. Addressing these issues is paramount to improving the organization's overall security posture and readiness against evolving threats.</p>
