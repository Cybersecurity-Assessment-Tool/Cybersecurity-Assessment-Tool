        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan identified a critical exposure with an open Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) service on port 3389, accessible from the internet. Policy review indicates that while Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required for email and sensitive data systems, it is not enforced for computer logins. Additionally, the organization lacks dedicated security awareness training for new employees, although an acceptable use policy is in place and annual security training is provided to all existing employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>RDP Exposure - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) service is exposed to the internet on port 3389, as identified by an Nmap scan showing an open 'ms-wbt-server' service. This direct exposure allows external parties to attempt to connect to internal systems, making them highly vulnerable to brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, and exploitation of known RDP vulnerabilities (e.g., BlueKeep, DejaBlue), potentially leading to unauthorized access and system compromise.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP address of scanned host</li><li>Port 3389</li><li>ms-wbt-server service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for employees to log into their computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if employee credentials are stolen or compromised, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication. This vulnerability could lead to lateral movement within the network and access to sensitive data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers</li><li>User authentication processes</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate New Employee Security Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not provide dedicated security awareness training for new employees during their onboarding process. This leaves new hires vulnerable to social engineering attacks (such as phishing, pretexting, and business email compromise) and potentially unaware of critical security policies and best practices from the start, thereby increasing the overall human risk factor for the organization.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational data susceptible to social engineering</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately close port 3389 to external access to prevent RDP exposure. For secure remote access, implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or a secure gateway solution. Furthermore, enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins across the organization to significantly enhance endpoint security and prevent unauthorized access from compromised credentials. Finally, develop and implement a mandatory security awareness training program specifically for all new employees as part of their onboarding process, covering essential topics like phishing, password hygiene, data handling, and incident reporting.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces critical and high-severity vulnerabilities, primarily due to an exposed RDP service and a lack of MFA for computer logins. The absence of security awareness training for new employees also presents a medium-severity risk. While some security measures like MFA for email and sensitive data, and annual training for existing staff are in place, these gaps significantly reduce the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and increase its susceptibility to cyberattacks. Addressing these issues promptly is crucial for improving the security posture.</p>
