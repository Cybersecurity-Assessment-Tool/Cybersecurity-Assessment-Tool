        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently hosts a MySQL database (version 5.7.33) with port 3306 openly accessible, posing a significant risk of unauthorized access. Furthermore, a review of organizational policies reveals critical gaps in access control and security awareness. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for email access, computer logins, or sensitive data systems, leaving accounts highly vulnerable to compromise. While an acceptable use policy is in place and new employees receive security awareness training, annual training for all employees is not conducted, which can lead to outdated security practices and increased susceptibility to social engineering attacks.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network. This exposes the database to potential unauthorized access, data breaches, and service disruption if not properly secured. Identified via Nmap scan showing open port 3306.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email, logging into computers, or accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access and account compromise, even if passwords are stolen or weak. Identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email access</li><li>Computer login</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, annual training is not conducted for all employees. This leaves the organization vulnerable to evolving social engineering attacks, phishing, and other human-factor risks as employees may not be updated on the latest threats and best practices. Identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement robust firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted internal IP addresses or via a secure VPN. Immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, to significantly enhance account security. Furthermore, establish a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees to ensure they are continuously updated on the latest threats and best practices, reinforcing a strong security culture. Regularly review and update security policies and conduct periodic vulnerability assessments.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to an openly exposed database, a complete lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for critical access points, and insufficient ongoing security awareness training for its workforce. While some foundational policies are in place, the absence of these crucial security controls places the organization at a high risk of data breaches, unauthorized access, and operational disruption. Addressing these vulnerabilities promptly is paramount to improving the overall security posture and readiness against modern cyber threats.</p>
