        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network assessment revealed several areas requiring immediate attention to enhance its security posture. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is in place for email access, it is notably absent for computer logins and sensitive data systems. An open port 80 was identified, indicating potential unencrypted web traffic or an exposed web service. Furthermore, the organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy and does not provide initial security awareness training for new employees, although annual training is conducted for all staff.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open Port 80 (HTTP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open port 80 indicates that a web server is likely running and serving unencrypted HTTP traffic. This can expose sensitive information transmitted over the network to eavesdropping. Additionally, web servers are frequent targets for various attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, directory traversal) if not properly secured and patched.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li><li>Web Server</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access. If an attacker compromises a user's password through phishing, brute-force, or credential stuffing, they can gain direct access to the computer without an additional layer of security. This can lead to data breaches, system compromise, and lateral movement within the network.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Critical systems containing sensitive data are not protected by Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). This means that a single compromised password could grant an attacker access to highly confidential information, leading to severe data breaches, regulatory fines, reputational damage, and intellectual property theft.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>File shares</li><li>Cloud storage</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The lack of an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) means there are no formal guidelines for how employees should use company IT resources, including internet, email, and hardware. This can lead to misuse of company assets, exposure to malware from unauthorized websites, data leakage through unapproved services, and a general lack of accountability, increasing the risk of both accidental and malicious insider threats.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees are not receiving initial security awareness training. This leaves them vulnerable to common cyber threats such as phishing, social engineering, and malware, as they may not be aware of best practices for identifying and reporting suspicious activities. This significantly increases the organization's attack surface during the onboarding period.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Email systems</li><li>Network endpoints</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly improve the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and access to sensitive data systems. The open port 80 should be addressed by either redirecting all traffic to HTTPS (port 443) with a valid SSL/TLS certificate to ensure encrypted communication, or by ensuring the service running on it is not exposing sensitive information and is properly secured. Furthermore, the organization must develop and enforce a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy to guide employee behavior regarding IT resource usage. Mandatory security awareness training should be introduced for all new employees during their onboarding process to equip them with essential cybersecurity knowledge from day one. The existing annual security awareness training for all employees should be continued and regularly updated.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In conclusion, the organization faces several critical and high-severity risks primarily stemming from inadequate authentication controls for computer and sensitive data access, a lack of formal policy for employee IT usage, and a gap in initial security awareness training for new hires. While MFA for email and annual training are positive steps, these vulnerabilities collectively present a significant attack surface that could be exploited by malicious actors. Addressing these identified risks through the recommended actions is crucial for bolstering the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and protecting its assets.</p>
