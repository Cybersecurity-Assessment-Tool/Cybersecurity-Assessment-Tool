        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization currently lacks multi-factor authentication for email access, which is a critical security control for protecting against unauthorized access to communication channels. Furthermore, there is an absence of fundamental security policies and training programs, including an employee acceptable use policy and regular security awareness training for both new and existing employees. While MFA is implemented for computer logins and sensitive data systems, these gaps in email security and human-factor controls significantly increase the organization's overall risk posture.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee inboxes through phishing, brute-force attacks, or compromised credentials. A single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to sensitive communications, potentially leading to further system compromise, data exfiltration, or business email compromise (BEC) scams. This was identified through the organizational data indicating "Do you require MFA to access email?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email accounts</li><li>Communication systems</li><li>Employee credentials</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). Without an AUP, employees may be unaware of their responsibilities regarding the use of company IT resources, data handling, and internet usage. This can lead to increased risks such as data leakage, malware infections from inappropriate web browsing, non-compliance with regulations, and general misuse of company assets, as there are no clear guidelines or consequences defined. This was identified through the organizational data indicating "Does your organization have an employee acceptable use policy?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All IT systems</li><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or on an annual basis for all employees. This leaves the workforce vulnerable to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, vishing, pretexting), malware, and other human-factor exploits. Employees who are not regularly trained on current threats and best practices are more likely to make mistakes that could lead to security incidents, data breaches, or system compromises. This was identified through the organizational data indicating "Does your organization do security awareness training for new employees?":"No" and "Does your organization do security awareness training for all employees at least once per year?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li><li>Email systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access immediately. This critical control will drastically reduce the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive communications. Furthermore, the organization should develop and enforce a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) to clearly define expectations for IT resource usage and data handling. Concurrently, a robust security awareness training program must be established, including mandatory training for all new hires and annual refresher training for all employees, to educate the workforce on current threats and best security practices. Regular training will empower employees to be the first line of defense against social engineering and other human-centric attacks.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for email access and a critical lack of foundational security policies and training programs. While MFA is appropriately deployed for computer logins and sensitive data systems, the vulnerabilities related to email security and human-factor controls present substantial exposure to potential breaches and operational disruptions. Addressing these identified gaps through the implementation of MFA for email, an acceptable use policy, and comprehensive security awareness training is paramount to improving the overall security readiness and resilience of the organization.</p>
