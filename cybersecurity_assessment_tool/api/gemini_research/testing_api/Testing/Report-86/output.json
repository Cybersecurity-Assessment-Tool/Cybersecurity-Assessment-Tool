            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network currently presents several critical security vulnerabilities. An Nmap scan revealed an open FTP service (vsftpd 2.3.4) allowing anonymous login, posing a significant risk of unauthorized data access and modification. Furthermore, a substantial portion of workstations are running Windows 7, an end-of-life operating system, leaving them exposed to known and unpatched vulnerabilities. Organizational policies also show weaknesses, including the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for sensitive data systems, a lack of an employee acceptable use policy, and insufficient annual security awareness training for all employees. While MFA is used for email and computer logins, its absence for critical data systems is a major concern. These combined factors indicate a moderate to high-risk security posture, with several immediate threats requiring urgent attention.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Anonymous FTP Access",
                        "Overview": "The Nmap scan identified an open FTP service (vsftpd 2.3.4) on port 21, which allows anonymous login. This means unauthorized users can access and potentially modify files on the FTP server without credentials, leading to data breaches, unauthorized data modification, or even system compromise if sensitive files are stored or if the FTP server is misconfigured to allow writing to critical directories.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "FTP Server (vsftpd 2.3.4)",
                            "Port 21"

                    {
                        "Risk": "Outdated Windows Policy",
                        "Overview": "Computers are running Windows 7, which has reached its end-of-life and no longer receives security updates from Microsoft. This leaves workstations vulnerable to known and newly discovered exploits, making them easy targets for attackers. Continued use of an unsupported operating system significantly increases the risk of system compromise, data loss, and malware infections.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Workstations"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical data if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or other means. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                    {
                        "Risk": "No Employee Acceptable Use Policy",
                        "Overview": "The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This means there are no formal guidelines for employees regarding the proper use of company IT resources, internet access, email, and data handling. This can lead to increased risks of malware infections, data leakage, legal liabilities, and general misuse of company assets due to a lack of clear expectations and rules.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All Employees",
                            "Company IT Resources"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Infrequent Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. While new employees receive training, ongoing education is crucial to keep employees informed about evolving threats (e.g., new phishing techniques, social engineering tactics) and reinforce best practices. This oversight leaves the organization vulnerable to human error, which is a leading cause of security incidents.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All Employees"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, immediate action is required. Firstly, the anonymous FTP access must be disabled, and the vsftpd service should be updated to a supported version or replaced with a more secure file transfer solution. All workstations running Windows 7 must be upgraded to a currently supported operating system, such as Windows 10 or 11, to ensure they receive critical security updates. Implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems is paramount to prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised. The organization should also develop and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to guide proper IT resource usage and reduce misuse. Finally, a robust annual security awareness training program for all employees should be established and regularly conducted to educate staff on evolving threats and best practices, reinforcing a strong security culture.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization faces a significant number of critical and high-severity vulnerabilities, primarily stemming from outdated software, misconfigured services, and gaps in security policies and training. The presence of anonymous FTP access, end-of-life operating systems on workstations, and the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems represent immediate and exploitable threats. While some security measures like MFA for email and computer logins are in place, the overall readiness is compromised by these critical weaknesses. Addressing these issues promptly through system upgrades, policy implementation, and enhanced security training is essential to elevate the organization's security posture and protect against potential cyberattacks and data breaches."
