        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to foundational security controls, including multi-factor authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, as well as an established employee acceptable use policy. Security awareness training is provided for new employees. However, a critical vulnerability was identified: an open MySQL port (3306) on the network, exposing a database. Additionally, the organization currently lacks annual security awareness training for all employees, which is a significant gap in maintaining a robust security posture.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network, potentially allowing unauthorized access to the database. This exposure could lead to data breaches, unauthorized data manipulation, or denial of service if exploited. The vulnerability was identified through a network scan showing the open port and the running MySQL service (version 5.7.33).</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted internal IP addresses or specific application servers. For a long-term solution, consider placing the database behind a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or implementing more granular network segmentation to further isolate sensitive data. Furthermore, to address the gap in employee training, the organization should establish and enforce a policy for mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees to ensure ongoing vigilance against evolving cyber threats.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has implemented strong controls such as MFA across critical access points and an acceptable use policy, the presence of an open MySQL port represents a significant and high-severity vulnerability that could lead to severe data compromise. The lack of annual security awareness training for all employees also indicates a potential weakness in maintaining a consistently secure human firewall. Overall, the organization's current readiness is moderate, with critical areas requiring immediate attention to prevent potential security incidents.</p>
