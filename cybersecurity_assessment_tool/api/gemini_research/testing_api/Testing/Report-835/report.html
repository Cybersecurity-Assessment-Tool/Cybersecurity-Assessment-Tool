        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, and conducts regular security awareness training for all employees. However, MFA is not required for accessing sensitive data systems, and there is no employee acceptable use policy in place. A network scan revealed an open SSH port (22), which, while common, requires robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if primary credentials are compromised (e.g., via phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing). The impact could include data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and reputational damage. This was identified through the 'Org Data' indicating 'Do you require MFA to access sensitive data systems?':'No'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines on the appropriate use of company IT resources, employees may inadvertently or intentionally engage in activities that pose security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive information. This can lead to malware infections, data leakage, and legal liabilities. This was identified through the 'Org Data' indicating 'Does your organization have an employee acceptable use policy?':'No'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee workstations</li><li>Network resources</li><li>Company data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port (22) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A network scan identified an open SSH (Secure Shell) port (22). While SSH is a legitimate and secure protocol for remote administration, an open port presents a potential attack vector if not adequately secured. Attackers could attempt brute-force attacks, exploit vulnerabilities in the SSH server software, or gain unauthorized access if weak credentials are used. This was identified through the 'Network Scan Data' showing 'portid':'22','state':'open'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Network perimeter</li><li>Servers/devices listening on port 22</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access even if primary credentials are compromised. Furthermore, developing and enforcing a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy is crucial to establish clear guidelines for IT resource usage, thereby reducing human-related security risks. For the identified open SSH port (22), ensure that strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., key-based authentication), disable root login, and implement IP-based access restrictions are in place. Regularly patch and update SSH server software to mitigate known vulnerabilities.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security through its use of MFA for email and computer logins and consistent security awareness training. However, critical gaps exist, particularly the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems and a formal acceptable use policy, which expose the organization to significant data breach and operational risks. The open SSH port also requires diligent management. Addressing these vulnerabilities proactively is essential to strengthen the overall security posture and readiness against evolving cyber threats.</p>
