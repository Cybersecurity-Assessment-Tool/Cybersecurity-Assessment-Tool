        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to cybersecurity through its established acceptable use policy and consistent security awareness training for all employees. However, critical vulnerabilities have been identified, primarily concerning authentication mechanisms and network exposure. An Nmap scan revealed an open SSH port, presenting a potential entry point. Furthermore, the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and sensitive data systems significantly elevates the risk of account compromise and unauthorized data access, despite MFA being required for computer logins. These gaps indicate a need for immediate attention to strengthen the organization's overall security posture.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Service - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH (Secure Shell) port (port 22) was identified on the target system via an Nmap scan. While SSH is a legitimate service for remote administration, an open port presents a potential attack vector if not properly secured. Unauthorized access through this port could lead to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further network penetration.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Target IP:22 (SSH Service)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of email account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. A compromised email account can be used for further phishing, business email compromise (BEC) scams, or to gain access to other linked services, leading to widespread impact. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Organizational Email System</li><li>Employee Email Accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised. Attackers could gain access to confidential information, intellectual property, or customer data, leading to data breaches, regulatory fines, and severe reputational damage. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive Data Systems</li><li>Databases containing sensitive information</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and for all sensitive data systems. For the open SSH service, implement robust security measures such as disabling password authentication in favor of key-based authentication, restricting access to a whitelist of trusted IP addresses, ensuring the SSH server software is up-to-date, and considering changing the default port. Continue the current practices of regular security awareness training and maintaining an acceptable use policy, as these are crucial for fostering a security-conscious culture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has a solid foundation in security awareness training and policy, its current readiness is significantly hampered by critical vulnerabilities. The absence of MFA for email and sensitive data systems, coupled with an exposed SSH service, creates substantial attack vectors. Addressing these high and critical risks through the recommended mitigations is paramount to enhancing the organization's cybersecurity posture and protecting its assets from potential threats.</p>
