            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network scan revealed an open Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) port (3389) with the 'ms-wbt-server' service exposed. This indicates a potential entry point for attackers. From an organizational standpoint, the company has implemented MFA for email and computer logins, and has an acceptable use policy and new employee security awareness training in place. However, MFA is not required for sensitive data systems, and annual security awareness training for all employees is not conducted.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "RDP Exposure",
                        "Overview": "Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed on port 3389, allowing external access to the 'ms-wbt-server' service. This presents a critical risk as it can be exploited for brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or direct access if weak credentials are used, potentially leading to unauthorized system access and data breaches. This was identified via an Nmap scan showing port 3389 open.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "External IP Address (Port 3389)"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Inadequate MFA for Sensitive Data",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if primary credentials are compromised through phishing, malware, or other means. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to sensitive data. This was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Sensitive Data Systems"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Infrequent Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. While new employees receive training, the lack of regular, recurring training leaves existing employees vulnerable to evolving threats such as advanced phishing techniques, social engineering, and malware. This increases the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents. This was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All Employees",
                            "Organizational Security Posture"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately close the exposed RDP port (3389) to external access. For legitimate remote access needs, implement a secure Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution that requires strong authentication. Furthermore, implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access even if primary credentials are compromised. Finally, establish a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees to ensure they are continuously updated on the latest cyber threats and best practices, reinforcing a strong security culture.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces critical security risks primarily due to an exposed RDP service and a lack of MFA for sensitive data systems. While some foundational security measures like MFA for email and computer logins are in place, the absence of comprehensive annual security awareness training further weakens the overall security posture. Addressing these vulnerabilities promptly is crucial to prevent potential breaches and enhance the organization's readiness against cyber threats."
