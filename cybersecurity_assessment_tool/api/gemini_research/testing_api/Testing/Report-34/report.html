        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network infrastructure details are not available from the provided scan data, which was empty. However, an assessment of the organization's security posture based on provided policy and MFA data indicates several areas requiring attention. While MFA is utilized for computer logins and sensitive data systems, it is notably absent for email access. Furthermore, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees, which are critical components of a robust security program.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks. If an attacker gains access to an employee's email, it can lead to further internal network access, data exfiltration, or business email compromise (BEC) scams. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on email access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email accounts</li><li>User credentials</li><li>Organizational communication</li><li>Sensitive data accessible via email</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not have an employee acceptable use policy in place. Without an AUP, employees may be unaware of the proper and acceptable use of company IT resources, data, and internet access. This can lead to misuse of company assets, exposure to malware, data leakage, and potential legal or compliance issues. The lack of a clear policy makes it difficult to enforce security best practices and hold employees accountable for their actions. This was identified from the organizational data stating 'No' for an acceptable use policy.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational IT resources</li><li>Company data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. Regular training is crucial to keep employees updated on the latest threats, reinforce security best practices, and maintain a strong security culture. Without annual training, employees may forget previous lessons, become complacent, or be unaware of new attack vectors like advanced phishing techniques or social engineering tactics, making them more susceptible to falling victim to cyberattacks. This was identified from the organizational data indicating 'No' for annual security awareness training for all employees.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li><li>Data protection</li><li>Incident response readiness</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implements Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts. This will significantly enhance protection against unauthorized access. Furthermore, the organization should develop and enforce a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) that clearly outlines expectations for the use of company IT resources and data. Finally, a program for mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees should be established to ensure continuous education on evolving cyber threats and best practices, thereby strengthening the human firewall.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently exhibits a moderate security posture with critical gaps in email security, policy enforcement, and ongoing employee training. While MFA is commendably used for sensitive systems and computer logins, the absence of MFA for email access presents a high-severity vulnerability. The lack of an acceptable use policy and annual security awareness training further exposes the organization to human-factor risks and potential misuse of resources. Addressing these identified vulnerabilities is crucial for enhancing the overall security readiness and resilience against common cyber threats.</p>
