        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan indicates that the targeted host has no open ports, suggesting a potentially hardened external perimeter or limited network exposure. Internally, the organization demonstrates a strong commitment to identity and access management by requiring Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and access to sensitive data systems. However, critical gaps exist in foundational security policies and training. Specifically, there is no employee acceptable use policy, and new employees do not receive security awareness training, which could expose the organization to internal threats and social engineering risks.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks an employee acceptable use policy (AUP). This absence creates a significant control gap, increasing the risk of employees misusing company resources, engaging in activities that could lead to data breaches, or incurring legal liabilities due to undefined boundaries for technology usage. Without clear guidelines, employees may inadvertently compromise security or violate compliance requirements. This vulnerability was identified through the review of organizational security practices.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Company network infrastructure</li><li>Legal and compliance posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees within the organization do not receive dedicated security awareness training. This oversight leaves new hires particularly susceptible to social engineering tactics such as phishing, pretexting, and other forms of manipulation. Untrained new employees represent a potential weak link in the security chain, increasing the likelihood of accidental data exposure, malware introduction, or unauthorized access to systems. This vulnerability was identified through the review of organizational security practices.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Sensitive organizational data</li><li>Email systems</li><li>Internal network</li><li>Overall security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks and enhance the overall security posture, it is strongly recommended that the organization develop and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy (AUP). This policy should clearly outline expectations for technology usage, data handling, and security protocols, and be communicated to all employees. Furthermore, a mandatory security awareness training program specifically for new employees should be established to educate them on common threats, organizational security policies, and best practices from their first day. Regular, ongoing security awareness training for all employees should also continue to reinforce these principles. While the current implementation of MFA across critical systems is commendable, continuous monitoring and periodic reviews of all security controls are advised to adapt to evolving threat landscapes.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In conclusion, the organization exhibits a mixed security readiness posture. Strengths include robust Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) implementation for key access points, indicating a strong commitment to identity protection. However, significant vulnerabilities exist in foundational areas of security governance and human factors. The absence of an employee acceptable use policy and dedicated security awareness training for new employees introduces considerable risk related to internal threats, human error, and compliance. Addressing these policy and training gaps is crucial for building a more resilient and comprehensive cybersecurity defense.</p>
