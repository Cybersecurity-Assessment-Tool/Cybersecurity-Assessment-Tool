        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization operates a web server running Nginx version 1.18.0 on port 443 with HTTPS. Security controls include Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, and an employee acceptable use policy is in place. The organization conducts annual security awareness training for all employees. However, MFA is not required for sensitive data systems, and security awareness training is not provided to new employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Web Server Software - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nginx web server (version 1.18.0) detected on port 443 is end-of-life (EOL) since May 2022. Running EOL software means it no longer receives security updates, leaving it vulnerable to known and newly discovered exploits. This significantly increases the risk of compromise, data breaches, and service disruption.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Nginx 1.18.0 on port 443</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Authentication for Sensitive Data - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if primary credentials (username/password) are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient New Employee Security Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. This leaves new hires potentially unaware of critical security policies, common attack vectors (e.g., phishing, social engineering), and best practices from the start of their employment, increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>It is strongly recommended to immediately upgrade the Nginx web server to a currently supported and stable version to mitigate critical vulnerabilities associated with end-of-life software. Furthermore, implement mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to significantly enhance protection against unauthorized access. Finally, introduce comprehensive security awareness training as part of the onboarding process for all new employees to ensure they are equipped with essential security knowledge from day one, complementing the existing annual training program.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces critical security risks primarily due to an outdated web server and a significant gap in authentication for sensitive data systems. While some security measures like MFA for email and computer logins are in place, the absence of MFA for sensitive data and initial security training for new employees leaves the organization vulnerable. Addressing these identified vulnerabilities is crucial for improving the overall security posture and readiness against cyber threats.</p>
