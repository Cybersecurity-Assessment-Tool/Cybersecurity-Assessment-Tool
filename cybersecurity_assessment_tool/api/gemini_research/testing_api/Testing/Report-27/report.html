        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes a MySQL database on port 3306. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for email and sensitive data systems, it is notably absent for computer logins. The organization conducts security awareness training for new employees but lacks an annual training program for all staff and does not have an employee acceptable use policy in place.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network, potentially allowing unauthorized access to the database. This could lead to data breaches, unauthorized data modification, or denial of service. The vulnerability was identified through network scanning revealing an open MySQL port.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted IP addresses or internal networks. For a long-term solution, consider placing the database behind a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or implementing a more robust access control mechanism. Furthermore, the organization should implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to enhance endpoint security. It is crucial to develop and enforce an employee acceptable use policy to define expected behavior and responsibilities regarding company assets and data. Finally, establish a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees to ensure continuous education on current threats and best practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In conclusion, the organization faces significant risks primarily due to an exposed MySQL database and a lack of comprehensive security policies and controls, such as MFA for computer logins and an annual security awareness training program. While some foundational security measures like MFA for email and sensitive data are in place, the absence of an acceptable use policy and consistent training leaves the organization vulnerable to both external attacks and internal human error. Addressing these vulnerabilities and implementing the recommended controls will significantly improve the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and readiness.</p>
