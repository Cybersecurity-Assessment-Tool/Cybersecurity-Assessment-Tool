        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently utilizes an FTP service (vsftpd 2.3.4) that permits anonymous logins, posing a significant risk of unauthorized access and data exposure. A substantial portion of the workstation fleet is running Windows 7, an end-of-life operating system no longer receiving security updates. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for email access, it is notably absent for computer logins and access to sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization lacks comprehensive security awareness training for both new and existing employees, despite having an acceptable use policy in place. These factors collectively indicate several critical vulnerabilities and a general lack of readiness against modern cyber threats.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Operating System (Windows 7) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Computers are running Windows 7, which is an end-of-life operating system. This means it no longer receives security updates, making systems highly vulnerable to known exploits, malware, and zero-day attacks. The continued use of an unsupported OS significantly increases the attack surface and risk of compromise. This was identified through an internal audit.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Anonymous FTP Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A network scan identified an open FTP service (vsftpd 2.3.4) configured to allow anonymous login. This configuration permits unauthorized users to access, potentially upload, or download files without authentication, leading to data leakage, unauthorized data modification, or the introduction of malicious content. This was identified via Nmap script 'ftp-anon'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>FTP Server (vsftpd 2.3.4)</li><li>Port 21</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This significantly weakens the security posture, as compromised credentials (e.g., through phishing or brute-force attacks) would grant an attacker direct access to internal systems without an additional layer of verification. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All Employee Workstations</li><li>Network Access Points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk to data confidentiality and integrity, as a single compromised password could lead to unauthorized access to highly sensitive information, potentially resulting in data breaches, regulatory fines, and reputational damage. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive Data Systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>Cloud Storage</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or annually for all employees. This leaves the workforce susceptible to social engineering attacks, phishing attempts, and other human-centric vulnerabilities. A lack of awareness increases the likelihood of employees inadvertently causing security incidents or falling victim to scams. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All Employees</li><li>Organizational Culture</li><li>Email Systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately upgrade all Windows 7 workstations to a currently supported operating system like Windows 10 or 11. The anonymous FTP access should be disabled or, if absolutely necessary, reconfigured with strict read-only permissions for non-sensitive data and robust authentication. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all computer logins and, critically, for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access from compromised credentials. Furthermore, establish a mandatory and recurring security awareness training program for all employees, including new hires, to educate them on common cyber threats and best security practices. Regular patching and updating of all software, especially network services, should also be enforced.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks stemming from outdated operating systems, insecure network services, critical gaps in multi-factor authentication implementation, and a lack of employee security awareness training. While an acceptable use policy is in place and MFA is used for email, the absence of these controls for computer logins and sensitive data systems, combined with the use of end-of-life software and an open FTP service, creates a highly vulnerable environment. Immediate and comprehensive action is required to address these deficiencies and significantly improve the organization's overall security posture and readiness against evolving cyber threats.</p>
