        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization exhibits a foundational level of cybersecurity readiness, with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) implemented for email and sensitive data systems, and an acceptable use policy in place. Annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees. However, critical vulnerabilities were identified, including an exposed Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) service and a lack of MFA for computer logins. Additionally, new employees do not receive security awareness training, representing a potential gap in the initial security posture of personnel.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>RDP Exposure - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed to the internet, allowing potential attackers to attempt brute-force attacks or exploit vulnerabilities in the RDP service. This was identified through a network scan showing port 3389 open. The impact could range from unauthorized access to the system to full network compromise, leading to data breaches or system disruption.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediately close Port 3389 or restrict access to trusted IP addresses only to mitigate the RDP exposure. For secure remote access, implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution. Furthermore, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to significantly enhance endpoint security. Introduce comprehensive security awareness training for all new employees as part of their onboarding process to ensure a consistent baseline of security knowledge across the organization.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces critical security risks primarily due to an exposed RDP service and a lack of MFA for computer logins. While some security measures are in place, these significant vulnerabilities, coupled with a gap in new employee security training, indicate a moderate level of cybersecurity readiness. Addressing these identified risks promptly is essential to prevent potential breaches and strengthen the overall security posture.</p>
