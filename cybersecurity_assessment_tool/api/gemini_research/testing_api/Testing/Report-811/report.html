        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The provided network scan data is minimal, indicating only one host with an open SSH port (22). This limited visibility prevents a comprehensive technical assessment of the network infrastructure. However, an evaluation of the organization's self-reported security practices reveals several critical gaps in its security posture, particularly concerning multi-factor authentication, employee policies, and initial security awareness training. While annual security awareness training is conducted, the lack of foundational controls for email and sensitive data access, coupled with the absence of an acceptable use policy and new employee training, significantly elevates the organization's risk profile.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Email accounts are a primary target for cyberattacks, including phishing and credential stuffing. Without Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), a single compromised password can grant attackers full access to an employee's email, potentially leading to sensitive data exposure, business email compromise (BEC) attacks, and lateral movement within the network. This vulnerability was identified through the organization's self-reported security practices.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>All user email accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Systems containing sensitive organizational or customer data are critical assets. The absence of MFA on these systems means that if a user's credentials are stolen or guessed, unauthorized access to highly confidential information is possible. This significantly increases the risk of data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, financial losses, and severe reputational damage. This vulnerability was identified through the organization's self-reported security practices.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Without a clearly defined Acceptable Use Policy, employees may lack guidance on the appropriate use of company IT resources, data handling, internet browsing, and email communication. This can lead to increased risks such as inadvertent data leakage, malware infections from unapproved software or websites, and potential legal liabilities due to misuse of company assets. This vulnerability was identified through the organization's self-reported security practices.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT assets</li><li>Organizational data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees are often more susceptible to social engineering attacks, such as phishing, as they may not yet be familiar with the organization's specific security protocols, common threats, and reporting procedures. The absence of mandatory security awareness training during onboarding leaves new hires unprepared, increasing the human factor risk and making the organization more vulnerable to initial compromise. This vulnerability was identified through the organization's self-reported security practices.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, immediate implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and sensitive data systems is strongly recommended. Furthermore, the organization should develop, disseminate, and enforce a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy to clearly define expectations for IT resource usage. It is also crucial to establish and mandate security awareness training for all new employees as part of their onboarding process, complementing the existing annual training. Finally, conducting more extensive network scans would provide a clearer picture of technical vulnerabilities within the infrastructure.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant security risks primarily due to critical gaps in its foundational security policies and controls, particularly concerning MFA for email and sensitive data, and the absence of an acceptable use policy and initial security awareness training for new hires. While annual security training is a positive step, these identified vulnerabilities leave the organization highly susceptible to credential compromise, data breaches, and insider threats. Addressing these policy and process-related risks is paramount to improving overall readiness and protecting critical assets.</p>
