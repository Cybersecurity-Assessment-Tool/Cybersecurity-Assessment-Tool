            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network exhibits critical vulnerabilities, including an open FTP service allowing anonymous login. Furthermore, the organizational security posture is significantly weakened by the absence of multi-factor authentication for email access, a lack of an employee acceptable use policy, and no regular security awareness training. A significant number of workstations are also running an outdated operating system (Windows 7), which is no longer supported with security updates.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Anonymous FTP Access",
                        "Overview": "The Nmap scan identified an open FTP service (vsftpd 2.3.4) on port 21, allowing anonymous login. This means unauthorized users can access and potentially modify files on the FTP server without credentials, leading to data breaches, unauthorized data modification, or even server compromise.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "FTP Server (vsftpd 2.3.4)",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Email",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing, as a single compromised password would grant full access to an employee's email, potentially leading to data exfiltration and further internal compromise.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                    {
                        "Risk": "Absence of Acceptable Use Policy",
                        "Overview": "The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines, employees may engage in activities that pose security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling company data, leading to increased exposure to malware and data loss.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or annually for all employees. This leaves employees vulnerable to social engineering attacks (phishing, pretexting), malware, and other common threats, as they may not recognize or report suspicious activities, making the human element a significant weak point.",
                        "Severity": "High",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Outdated Operating System",
                        "Overview": "Several workstations are running Windows 7, an operating system that has reached its end-of-life and no longer receives security updates from Microsoft. This leaves these systems highly vulnerable to known exploits and new threats, making them easy targets for attackers and significantly increasing the risk of system compromise and data breach.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Workstations running Windows 7"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately disable anonymous FTP access and secure the FTP service. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts to prevent unauthorized access. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to guide employee behavior regarding IT resources. Establish and regularly conduct security awareness training for all employees, including new hires, to educate them on common threats and best security practices. Finally, all workstations running Windows 7 must be upgraded to a currently supported operating system, such as Windows 10 or 11, to ensure they receive critical security updates and patches.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces a high level of cybersecurity risk due to critical vulnerabilities in its network infrastructure and significant gaps in its security policies and employee training. The presence of anonymous FTP access, lack of MFA for email, absence of foundational security policies, and widespread use of an end-of-life operating system collectively indicate a low state of security readiness. Addressing these issues is paramount to protecting organizational assets and data from potential cyber threats."
