        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open port 8080, which was identified as hosting a "TOP SECRET DB". While this port was later confirmed as secured and deemed a false positive, the initial discovery highlights potential visibility of internal services. Furthermore, a review of organizational policies indicates significant gaps in security posture. The organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email or sensitive data systems, lacks an employee acceptable use policy, and does not conduct security awareness training for new or existing employees. These deficiencies expose the organization to various risks, including unauthorized access, data breaches, and social engineering attacks.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing, as a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to an employee's email.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>All employee email accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are stolen or guessed, potentially leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without a clear AUP, employees may be unaware of their responsibilities regarding company assets, data handling, and internet usage, increasing the risk of misuse, data leakage, and introduction of malware.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT assets</li><li>Data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training. This means new hires may not be equipped with the knowledge to identify and avoid common cyber threats like phishing, social engineering, or proper data handling procedures, making them potential weak links in the organization's security chain.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Annual Security Awareness Training for All Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. Regular training is crucial to keep employees updated on evolving threats and best practices. The absence of such training leads to a stale security posture among staff, increasing susceptibility to various cyberattacks over time.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open Port 8080 Hosting "TOP SECRET DB" (Confirmed Secure) - <span class="severity-Info">Info</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An Nmap scan identified port 8080 as open, hosting a service titled "TOP SECRET DB". While subsequent analysis confirmed this port is secured and the finding is a false positive, its initial discovery highlights the visibility of internal services. This indicates a need for careful monitoring of publicly exposed services, even if deemed secure.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li><li>"TOP SECRET DB" service</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, several key measures are recommended. Firstly, immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access even if passwords are compromised. Secondly, develop and enforce a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) to clearly define employee responsibilities regarding IT assets and data. Concurrently, establish a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees upon onboarding and conduct annual refresher training for all staff to ensure continuous education on evolving cyber threats and best practices. Finally, regularly review and validate the security status of all open ports and services, especially those with potentially sensitive titles, to prevent misconfigurations or overlooked vulnerabilities.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to a lack of fundamental security controls and policies. The absence of MFA for critical systems like email and sensitive data, coupled with a complete lack of security awareness training and an acceptable use policy, creates a highly vulnerable environment. While an identified open port was confirmed secure, the broader organizational readiness is low. Addressing these foundational weaknesses through the recommended implementations is crucial to protect against common cyber threats, safeguard sensitive data, and improve overall security resilience.</p>
