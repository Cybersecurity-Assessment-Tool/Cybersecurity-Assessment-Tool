        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently presents several critical security vulnerabilities. A network scan identified an open FTP service allowing anonymous login, which poses a significant risk for unauthorized data access and manipulation. Furthermore, the organization's internal security posture is weakened by the use of outdated operating systems (Windows 7 workstations) and a lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA) for computer logins and access to sensitive data systems. While annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees, there is no specific training for new hires, and a formal acceptable use policy is absent. These gaps indicate a need for immediate attention to both technical and policy-driven security controls.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Anonymous FTP Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The FTP service (vsftpd 2.3.4) on port 21 allows anonymous login, meaning unauthorized users can access and potentially modify files on the FTP server without credentials. This vulnerability can lead to data breaches, unauthorized data modification, or the hosting of malicious content. It was identified via an Nmap scan using the 'ftp-anon' script.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>FTP Server (vsftpd 2.3.4 on port 21)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Operating System - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Computers are running Windows 7, which has reached its end-of-life and no longer receives security updates from Microsoft. This leaves systems vulnerable to known exploits and new threats, significantly increasing the risk of compromise and making them a prime target for attackers.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This means that if an attacker obtains a user's password, they can gain full access to the computer without an additional layer of security, increasing the risk of unauthorized access and lateral movement within the network.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers/workstations</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical and confidential information if credentials are compromised, potentially leading to severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Missing Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines on appropriate use of company IT resources, employees may inadvertently engage in risky behaviors (e.g., visiting malicious websites, installing unauthorized software) that could compromise network security. This also makes it difficult to enforce security standards and hold employees accountable.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>IT systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate New Employee Security Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. This means new hires may not be aware of common cyber threats (phishing, social engineering) or organizational security policies, making them more susceptible to attacks and potentially introducing vulnerabilities into the network from day one.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Overall organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately disable anonymous FTP access or secure the FTP service with strong authentication and access controls. All workstations running Windows 7 should be upgraded to a currently supported operating system like Windows 10 or 11, with a long-term plan for hardware refit if necessary. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and, critically, for access to all sensitive data systems to significantly enhance access security. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to guide appropriate IT resource usage. Additionally, introduce mandatory security awareness training for all new employees to ensure they are equipped with essential cybersecurity knowledge from the start, complementing the existing annual training.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization faces a combination of critical technical vulnerabilities and significant policy gaps. The presence of anonymous FTP access, outdated operating systems, and the absence of MFA for critical access points expose the organization to a high risk of data breaches and unauthorized system access. While some security awareness is present, the lack of a formal acceptable use policy and specific training for new hires further exacerbates the human element risk. Addressing these issues promptly through technical remediation and policy implementation is crucial for improving the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and readiness against evolving threats.</p>
