        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan indicates no open ports on the target host. However, a specific risk assessment identified an unencrypted web server with Port 80 reported as open, suggesting a potential discrepancy or a specific service not covered by the general scan. From an organizational standpoint, while Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for email access, it is notably absent for computer logins and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or annually for all staff, indicating significant gaps in foundational security practices.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unencrypted Web Server - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Port 80 is open. This indicates that a web server is running without encryption, making all traffic unencrypted and vulnerable to eavesdropping and data interception. This was identified through a risk assessment.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are compromised, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers</li><li>Login authentication systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Access to sensitive data systems does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). This poses a critical risk, as compromised credentials could lead to unauthorized access, exfiltration, or manipulation of sensitive information without an additional layer of security. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>File shares</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This means there are no formal guidelines for employees regarding the proper and secure use of company IT resources, increasing the risk of misuse, data breaches, and non-compliance. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>IT systems</li><li>Data handling practices</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or annually for all staff. This leaves employees vulnerable to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) and unaware of best security practices, making them a potential weak link in the security chain. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement SSL/TLS encryption for all web services, especially for Port 80, to secure data in transit. For immediate remediation, ensure any unencrypted web services are secured or taken offline if not critical. Furthermore, the organization must prioritize the implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and, critically, for access to all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access from compromised credentials. Developing and enforcing a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy is essential to guide employees on secure IT resource usage. Finally, establishing a mandatory security awareness training program for all new hires and conducting annual refresher training for all employees is crucial to educate staff on cybersecurity best practices and reduce the risk of human-factor vulnerabilities.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks stemming from both technical vulnerabilities and critical gaps in foundational security practices. While email access benefits from MFA, the absence of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, coupled with a complete lack of security awareness training and an acceptable use policy, creates a highly vulnerable environment. Addressing these systemic issues is paramount to improving the organization's overall security posture and readiness against evolving cyber threats.</p>
