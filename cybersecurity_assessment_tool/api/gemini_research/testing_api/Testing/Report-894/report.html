        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan indicates that port 80 is closed, suggesting no unencrypted web server is directly exposed. However, a review of organizational data reveals significant security gaps. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is not required for accessing email, logging into computers, or accessing sensitive data systems. While an employee acceptable use policy is in place and new employees receive security awareness training, annual security awareness training for all employees is not conducted.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for critical access points, including email systems, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. This significantly elevates the risk of unauthorized access in the event of compromised credentials, making the organization highly susceptible to phishing attacks, brute-force attempts, and credential stuffing. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to critical organizational resources.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email systems</li><li>Employee computers</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Ongoing Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive initial security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This lack of continuous education leaves the workforce vulnerable to evolving cyber threats, social engineering tactics, and sophisticated phishing campaigns. Employees may not be up-to-date on current best practices, increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, establishing a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees is crucial to ensure the workforce remains informed about current threats and best practices. Regular review and updates to the acceptable use policy should also be conducted to reflect evolving security standards.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces critical vulnerabilities primarily due to the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication and insufficient ongoing security awareness training. While some foundational policies and initial training are in place, these significant gaps expose the organization to a high risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and successful social engineering attacks. Addressing these areas is paramount to improving overall cybersecurity readiness and protecting critical assets.</p>
