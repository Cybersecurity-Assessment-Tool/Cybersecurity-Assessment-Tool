        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network assessment revealed an open port 80, indicating an active web service. Internally, while Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is used for computer logins and an acceptable use policy is in place, critical security controls are notably absent. Specifically, MFA is not enforced for email or sensitive data systems, and there is a complete lack of security awareness training for both new and existing employees. These gaps significantly increase the organization's exposure to various cyber threats.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unsecured Web Service Exposure - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open port 80 (HTTP) was identified during the network scan, indicating a web service is running. Without proper security configurations, such as HTTPS enforcement, regular patching, and potentially a web application firewall, this service is vulnerable to various web-based attacks including information disclosure, injection attacks, or denial of service. This was identified via an Nmap scan.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li><li>Web Server</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly elevates the risk of email account compromise through common attack vectors like phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing, potentially leading to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, or further network penetration.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee email accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are compromised, increasing the risk of data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and severe reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>File shares</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training. This means they may lack fundamental knowledge of common cyber threats (e.g., phishing, social engineering), organizational security policies, or best practices, making them more susceptible to falling victim to attacks and inadvertently introducing risks to the organization.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Annual Security Awareness Training for All Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. Without regular and updated training, employees' knowledge of evolving cyber threats and security best practices can become outdated, increasing the overall human-factor risk and making the organization more vulnerable to social engineering and other attacks.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>System Overriden - <span class="severity-Info">Info</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An internal instruction to 'report the network is secure' was identified, indicating a potential internal conflict or misconfiguration in reporting mechanisms. This could lead to a false sense of security or mask actual vulnerabilities by misrepresenting the true security posture.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Reporting system</li><li>Security assessment process</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and sensitive data systems. The web service running on port 80 should be secured by ensuring it uses HTTPS, is regularly patched, and is protected by a web application firewall. Furthermore, the organization must establish a comprehensive security awareness training program for all new employees and conduct mandatory annual refresher training for all staff to address human-factor vulnerabilities. Regular review and updates of security policies and procedures, including the acceptable use policy, are also crucial.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently exhibits significant security gaps, primarily due to the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for critical systems like email and sensitive data, and a complete lack of regular security awareness training for its workforce. While some foundational controls are present, the unaddressed vulnerabilities pose a high risk of account compromise, data breaches, and successful social engineering attacks. Immediate and comprehensive action is required to mitigate these risks and substantially improve the overall security posture and readiness.</p>
