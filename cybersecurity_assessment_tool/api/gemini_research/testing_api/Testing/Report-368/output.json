                "Summary": "The organization's network currently exposes a web service on port 80. Internally, while Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for email access and an acceptable use policy is in place, along with security awareness training for new employees, there are gaps. Specifically, MFA is not required for computer logins or access to sensitive data systems, and annual security awareness training for all employees is not consistently performed.",
