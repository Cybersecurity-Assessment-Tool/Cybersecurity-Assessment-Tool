            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network scan revealed an open RDP port (3389), indicating potential exposure for remote desktop services. Internally, the organization demonstrates a strong commitment to security awareness training and has an acceptable use policy in place. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enforced for computer logins and sensitive data systems, which is a positive security measure. However, a critical gap exists as MFA is not required for email access, leaving this vector vulnerable to phishing and credential compromise.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "RDP Exposure",
                        "Overview": "Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed to the internet via an open port (3389). This allows external entities to attempt to connect to internal systems, increasing the risk of brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, and unauthorized access. If successfully exploited, attackers could gain control over the affected system, leading to data breaches, system compromise, or further network penetration. This was identified through a network port scan revealing port 3389 as open.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "IP"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Email",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, credential stuffing, or other social engineering attacks. Without a second factor of authentication, a stolen password is often sufficient for an attacker to gain full access to an employee's email, which can then be used for further attacks, impersonation, or access to other connected systems. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Email System",
                            "Employee Accounts"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately close the exposed RDP port (3389) to the internet. For necessary remote access, implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution to secure RDP connections, ensuring only authenticated and authorized users can access internal resources. Furthermore, it is critical to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access. This will significantly enhance protection against credential theft and phishing attacks, which are common initial access vectors. Regular security awareness training should continue, emphasizing the importance of MFA and identifying phishing attempts.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization exhibits a mixed security posture. While strong in areas like security awareness training and MFA for sensitive systems, critical vulnerabilities exist with an an exposed RDP service and, more significantly, the absence of MFA for email access. These weaknesses present substantial risks for unauthorized access and account compromise. Addressing these high-priority items is crucial for improving the overall security readiness and reducing the attack surface."
