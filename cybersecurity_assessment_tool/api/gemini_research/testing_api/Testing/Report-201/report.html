        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open port 8080 with a title indicating a "TOP SECRET DB," posing a critical exposure risk. While the organization employs MFA for email and sensitive data systems, it lacks MFA for computer logins, creating a significant authentication vulnerability. Furthermore, the absence of an employee acceptable use policy introduces potential risks related to employee conduct and data handling. On a positive note, the organization conducts regular security awareness training for all employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed Sensitive Database/Application - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An Nmap scan identified port 8080 as open, with the HTTP title "TOP SECRET DB". This indicates that a database or application containing highly sensitive information is directly accessible from the network, potentially without adequate protection. Unauthorized access to this service could lead to severe data breaches, intellectual property theft, or complete system compromise. This critical exposure was identified through the http-title Nmap script.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li><li>"TOP SECRET DB" application/service</li><li>Sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Authentication for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for employee computer logins. This reliance on single-factor authentication (passwords) makes the organization highly susceptible to credential-based attacks, such as phishing, brute-force, or password reuse, which could grant unauthorized access to internal systems and data. This vulnerability was identified from the organizational security policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>User accounts</li><li>Internal network access</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy (AUP). Without clear guidelines on the appropriate use of company IT resources, data, and internet access, employees may inadvertently or intentionally engage in activities that pose security risks, violate compliance standards, or expose the organization to legal liabilities. This gap was identified from the organizational policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>IT infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately investigate the service running on port 8080, secure it by restricting access to authorized personnel only, and implement robust authentication mechanisms, potentially moving it behind a secure gateway or firewall. Furthermore, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) should be promptly implemented for all computer logins across the organization to significantly enhance protection against unauthorized access. Concurrently, a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy (AUP) must be developed, communicated, and enforced to ensure all employees understand their responsibilities regarding IT asset and data usage, thereby reducing human-factor risks. Regular security audits and penetration testing should also be conducted to continuously identify and address emerging vulnerabilities.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The current cybersecurity posture of the organization presents several significant vulnerabilities, notably a critically exposed "TOP SECRET DB" on port 8080 and a high risk due to the absence of MFA for computer logins. The lack of an acceptable use policy further exacerbates potential internal risks. While the organization demonstrates a commitment to security awareness training, these fundamental gaps in network security and policy implementation indicate a moderate level of readiness that requires immediate and focused attention to prevent potential data breaches and unauthorized system access.</p>
