        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The network scan identified an open SSH port (22). Furthermore, the organizational data reveals a critical lack of fundamental security controls, including the absence of multi-factor authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. The organization also lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct security awareness training for new or existing employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port (22) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH port (22) was detected on the network perimeter. While SSH is a legitimate service, an exposed port without proper hardening (e.g., strong passwords, key-based authentication, rate limiting, disabling root login) can be a target for brute-force attacks or other exploits, potentially leading to unauthorized access to internal systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Network perimeter</li><li>SSH server</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for email access, computer logins, or sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if employee credentials are compromised through phishing, malware, or other means. A single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to critical organizational resources.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email systems</li><li>User accounts</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Workstations</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines on the appropriate use of company assets, networks, and data, employees may inadvertently engage in activities that introduce security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive information. This increases the potential for data breaches, malware infections, and compliance violations.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Company assets</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or annually for all employees. This leaves the workforce vulnerable to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting), malware, and other human-centric threats. Employees who are not trained on best security practices are more likely to fall victim to attacks, making them a significant weak point in the organization's defenses.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>It is strongly recommended to immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical systems, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data access, to significantly reduce the risk of credential compromise. The exposed SSH server should be hardened by disabling root login, enforcing strong password policies, implementing key-based authentication, and configuring rate limiting; consider restricting access to trusted IP addresses only. Furthermore, the organization must develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy that clearly outlines expectations for using company resources securely. Finally, mandatory security awareness training should be established and regularly conducted for all employees, both new hires and existing staff, at least annually, covering topics such as phishing, password hygiene, data handling, and incident reporting.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks due to a critical lack of fundamental security controls and employee awareness. The absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), an acceptable use policy, and regular security training, combined with an exposed SSH port, creates a highly vulnerable environment. Addressing these critical gaps is paramount to improving the organization's security posture and reducing the likelihood of a successful cyberattack and data breach.</p>
