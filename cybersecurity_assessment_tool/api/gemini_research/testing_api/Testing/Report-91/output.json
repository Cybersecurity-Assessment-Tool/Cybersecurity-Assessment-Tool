            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network scan identified an open SSH port (22). Policy review indicates that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for email access or computer logins, though it is implemented for sensitive data systems. A notable gap is the absence of an employee acceptable use policy. On a positive note, the organization conducts security awareness training for both new employees and annually for all employees.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Email Access",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing, as a compromised password alone would grant full access. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Email system",
                            "User email accounts",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Computer Login",
                        "Overview": "Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not mandated for logging into organizational computers. This exposes endpoints to a higher risk of unauthorized access if a user's password is compromised. Attackers could gain access to internal systems, potentially leading to lateral movement within the network and data exfiltration. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                    {
                        "Risk": "No Employee Acceptable Use Policy",
                        "Overview": "The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines on the appropriate use of company IT resources, employees may inadvertently or intentionally engage in activities that pose security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive data. This increases the risk of malware infections, data breaches, and compliance violations. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                    {
                        "Risk": "Open SSH Port Exposure",
                        "Overview": "An Nmap scan revealed an open SSH (port 22) on a host within the network. While SSH is a legitimate service, an open port presents a potential attack surface for brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or exploitation of SSH vulnerabilities if not properly secured. If weak credentials or outdated SSH versions are in use, an attacker could gain remote access to the affected system. This vulnerability was identified via network scanning.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Host(s) with open port 22",
                            "SSH service configuration"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and computer logins. This critical step will drastically reduce the risk of unauthorized access even if passwords are compromised. Furthermore, the organization should immediately develop, disseminate, and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to establish clear guidelines for IT resource usage and mitigate insider threats. Regarding the open SSH port, a thorough review of its configuration is advised to ensure strong authentication methods (e.g., key-based authentication, disabling password authentication), IP whitelisting, and rate limiting are in place. Regular patching and updates for the SSH service are also crucial. The organization should continue its commendable efforts in conducting regular security awareness training for all employees.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of cybersecurity through its consistent security awareness training and the application of MFA for sensitive data systems. However, critical vulnerabilities exist due to the absence of MFA for email and computer access, which are primary targets for attackers. The lack of an acceptable use policy also introduces significant operational and security risks from within. The identified open SSH port, while potentially legitimate, represents an additional attack vector if not rigorously secured. Addressing these key areas is paramount to fortifying the organization's defenses against common cyber threats and improving its overall readiness."
