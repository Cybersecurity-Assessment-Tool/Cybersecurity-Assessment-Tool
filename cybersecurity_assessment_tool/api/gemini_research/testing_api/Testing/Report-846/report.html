        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a strong foundational security posture, with comprehensive implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization has an established employee acceptable use policy and conducts security awareness training for all new employees, with annual refresher training for all staff. This indicates a proactive approach to user-centric security and policy enforcement. However, a specific network vulnerability related to an unencrypted web server has been identified.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unencrypted Web Server - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The presence of an open Port 80 indicates an unencrypted web server. This allows for unencrypted HTTP traffic, making any data transmitted over this port vulnerable to interception and eavesdropping by malicious actors, potentially leading to data exposure or compromise. The risk was identified through a network scan that detected Port 80 in an open state.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>It is strongly recommended to immediately address the open Port 80. The easiest fix is to close this port if it is not essential for any service. For long-term security and if web services are required, implement SSL/TLS encryption for all web services to ensure data confidentiality and integrity. This involves configuring the web server to use HTTPS (Port 443) with a valid SSL certificate and redirecting all HTTP traffic to HTTPS, while ensuring Port 80 is either closed or only used for redirection.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization exhibits a commendable level of readiness in terms of policy, training, and MFA implementation, which are critical components of a robust security framework. However, the identified vulnerability of an unencrypted web server accessible via Port 80 presents a tangible risk of data exposure. While the organizational controls are strong, this specific technical vulnerability requires immediate attention to prevent potential data breaches and further strengthen the overall security posture.</p>
