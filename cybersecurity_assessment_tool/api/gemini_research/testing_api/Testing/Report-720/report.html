        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, and by conducting annual security awareness training for all employees. However, significant gaps exist in critical areas. Specifically, the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems, the lack of an acceptable use policy, and the omission of security awareness training for new employees expose the organization to considerable risks, including unauthorized data access, uncontrolled employee behavior, and increased susceptibility to social engineering attacks. These areas represent key vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if credentials are compromised through phishing, malware, or other means. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to sensitive data, leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Uncontrolled Employee Behavior & Data Misuse - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This means there are no formal guidelines or rules dictating how employees should use company IT resources, access data, or behave online. This absence can lead to misuse of company assets, exposure to malware, data leakage, and legal liabilities, as employees may unknowingly or knowingly engage in risky behaviors without clear boundaries.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Data assets</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>New Employee Vulnerability to Social Engineering & Cyber Threats - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. While annual training is provided, new hires are onboarded without initial education on cybersecurity best practices, common threats (like phishing), and organizational security policies. This leaves new employees highly susceptible to social engineering attacks and other cyber threats during their initial period, potentially making them an easy target for attackers seeking to gain initial access to the network.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Email systems</li><li>Internal network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised. Concurrently, a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy should be developed and enforced, clearly outlining expectations for IT resource usage and data handling. Furthermore, a mandatory security awareness training program must be established for all new employees as part of their onboarding process, ensuring they are equipped with essential cybersecurity knowledge from day one. Regular reviews and updates of these policies and training materials are also advised to adapt to evolving threat landscapes.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently exhibits a mixed state of cybersecurity readiness. While some essential security controls like MFA for email and computer logins, and annual security training are in place, critical vulnerabilities remain. The lack of MFA for sensitive data, the absence of an acceptable use policy, and the failure to provide initial security training for new hires significantly elevate the risk of data breaches, operational disruptions, and compliance failures. Addressing these specific gaps is paramount to strengthening the overall security posture and reducing the organization's exposure to cyber threats.</p>
