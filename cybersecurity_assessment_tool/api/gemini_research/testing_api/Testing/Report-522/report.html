        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, and conducting annual security awareness training for all employees. An acceptable use policy is also in place. However, a critical gap exists in the protection of sensitive data systems, as MFA is not mandated for access. Furthermore, new employees are not provided with initial security awareness training, leaving a window of vulnerability during their onboarding period. Network scans indicate that port 80 is closed, suggesting no unencrypted web server is directly exposed on this common port.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly elevates the risk of unauthorized access to critical information. If an attacker compromises a user's credentials through phishing, malware, or other methods, they could gain full access to sensitive data without an additional layer of authentication. This vulnerability directly impacts data confidentiality and integrity.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not provide security awareness training specifically for new employees. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering attacks, such as phishing, as they may not yet be fully familiar with the organization's security policies, common threats, or internal procedures. This lack of initial training exposes the organization to human-factor risks from the moment an employee joins, potentially leading to breaches through employee error or successful social engineering.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>Organizational network</li><li>Email systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems. This will add a crucial layer of security, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised. Additionally, a comprehensive security awareness training program should be established for all new employees, ideally as part of their onboarding process. This training should cover common threats like phishing, social engineering tactics, and the organization's specific security policies and best practices. Regular, mandatory refreshers should also be considered to reinforce these critical security behaviors.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has implemented some essential security controls like MFA for general logins and annual security training, significant vulnerabilities remain. The absence of MFA for sensitive data systems and the lack of initial security awareness training for new employees represent critical gaps that could be exploited by malicious actors. Addressing these areas is paramount to enhancing the organization's overall security posture and readiness against cyber threats.</p>
