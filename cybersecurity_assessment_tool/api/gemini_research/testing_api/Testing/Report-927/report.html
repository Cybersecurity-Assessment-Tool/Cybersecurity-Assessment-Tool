        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes a MySQL database on port 3306. Furthermore, the organization lacks several fundamental security controls. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is not required for accessing email, logging into computers, or accessing sensitive data systems. There is no employee acceptable use policy in place, and while new employees receive security awareness training, annual training for all employees is not conducted.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The MySQL database port 3306 is openly accessible on the network. This exposure allows potential attackers to directly interact with the database, increasing the risk of unauthorized data access, data exfiltration, or database compromise. This vulnerability was identified through network scanning which revealed the open port.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted internal IP addresses or specific application servers. For a long-term solution, consider placing the database behind a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or within a segmented network zone, accessible only via secure channels. Additionally, implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, to significantly enhance access security. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to define expected behavior and secure practices. Finally, establish a program for mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees to ensure ongoing education on current threats and best practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant security risks primarily due to an exposed database service and a lack of critical foundational security controls such as multi-factor authentication, an acceptable use policy, and comprehensive annual security awareness training. While new employee training is a positive step, the absence of these broader security measures leaves the organization vulnerable to various cyber threats, including unauthorized access and data breaches. Addressing these vulnerabilities and implementing the recommended controls is crucial to improving the overall security posture and readiness.</p>
