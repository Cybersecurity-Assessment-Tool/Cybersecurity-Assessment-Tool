                "Summary": "The organization's network scan revealed an open RDP port (3389), indicating potential exposure for remote desktop services. Furthermore, a review of organizational data indicates significant gaps in foundational security practices. Specifically, there is a complete absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. While an employee acceptable use policy is in place, there is no security awareness training for new employees or annual training for all employees. These findings suggest a low security readiness posture with several critical and high-severity vulnerabilities.",

                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. Without regular refreshers, employees may forget best practices, become complacent, or fail to recognize new threats, making the organization more susceptible to social engineering, phishing, and malware attacks over time.",

                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately close the exposed RDP port 3389 or restrict access to only trusted IP addresses, ideally placing it behind a VPN for secure remote access. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, starting with sensitive data systems, followed by email access and computer logins. This is a fundamental security control that significantly reduces the risk of credential compromise. Furthermore, establish a comprehensive security awareness training program. This program should include mandatory training for all new employees upon onboarding and annual refresher training for all existing employees to ensure a consistent understanding of current threats and best practices. Regularly review and update the acceptable use policy to reflect current security standards and integrate it with the training program.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to exposed services and a lack of fundamental security controls, most notably the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication across critical systems and insufficient security awareness training. While an acceptable use policy is present, its effectiveness is diminished without accompanying training. The current readiness posture is low, making the organization highly susceptible to various cyberattacks, including unauthorized access, data breaches, and social engineering. Addressing these vulnerabilities through the recommended actions is crucial for improving the overall security posture and protecting organizational assets."
