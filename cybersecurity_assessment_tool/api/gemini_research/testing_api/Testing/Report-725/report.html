        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open RDP port (3389), indicating potential exposure for remote desktop services. Furthermore, a review of organizational data indicates significant gaps in foundational security practices. Specifically, there is a complete absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. While an employee acceptable use policy is in place, there is no security awareness training for new employees or annual training for all employees. These findings suggest a low security readiness posture with several critical and high-severity vulnerabilities.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>RDP Exposure - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed on port 3389. This allows external access to the RDP service, which can be a target for brute-force attacks or exploitation of RDP vulnerabilities, potentially leading to unauthorized access to internal systems. This was identified via an Nmap scan showing port 3389 as open.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee inboxes if credentials are compromised, leading to potential data breaches, phishing attacks, and business email compromise (BEC).</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if user credentials are stolen or guessed, potentially allowing attackers to gain a foothold within the internal network.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Domain controllers</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This is a critical vulnerability as it means a single compromised password could grant an attacker direct access to highly confidential information, leading to severe data breaches, regulatory fines, and reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>File servers</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering and phishing attacks due to unfamiliarity with company policies and security best practices, increasing the risk of human error-induced breaches.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Regular Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. Without regular refreshers, employees may forget best practices, become complacent, or fail to recognize new threats, making the organization more susceptible to social engineering, phishing, and malware attacks over time.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately close the exposed RDP port 3389 or restrict access to only trusted IP addresses, ideally placing it behind a VPN for secure remote access. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, starting with sensitive data systems, followed by email access and computer logins. This is a fundamental security control that significantly reduces the risk of credential compromise. Furthermore, establish a comprehensive security awareness training program. This program should include mandatory training for all new employees upon onboarding and annual refresher training for all existing employees to ensure a consistent understanding of current threats and best practices. Regularly review and update the acceptable use policy to reflect current security standards and integrate it with the training program.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to exposed services and a lack of fundamental security controls, most notably the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication across critical systems and insufficient security awareness training. While an acceptable use policy is present, its effectiveness is diminished without accompanying training. The current readiness posture is low, making the organization highly susceptible to various cyberattacks, including unauthorized access, data breaches, and social engineering. Addressing these vulnerabilities through the recommended actions is crucial for improving the overall security posture and protecting organizational assets.</p>
