        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently operates with several critical security vulnerabilities and policy gaps. An Nmap scan identified an open FTP service (vsftpd 2.3.4) allowing anonymous login, posing a significant risk of unauthorized data access. Internally, while Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required for email and computer logins, it is notably absent for sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not provide security awareness training for new employees, although annual training is conducted for all staff. A critical finding is the continued use of Windows 7 on workstations, an end-of-life operating system, which exposes these systems to severe unpatched vulnerabilities.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Anonymous FTP Login Allowed - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The FTP server running vsftpd version 2.3.4 is configured to allow anonymous login. This configuration can lead to unauthorized access to files, potential data leakage, or even server compromise if write permissions are inadvertently enabled or misconfigured. This vulnerability was identified through an Nmap scan that successfully performed an anonymous FTP login.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>FTP Server (vsftpd 2.3.4)</li><li>Port 21</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information. If a single set of credentials (username and password) is compromised, an attacker can gain full access to sensitive data without an additional layer of security.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive Data Systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines on the proper use of company IT resources, employees may inadvertently or intentionally engage in activities that introduce security risks, violate compliance standards, or lead to data breaches. This absence creates ambiguity and increases the potential for misuse and security incidents.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Organizational Policy</li><li>Employees</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees are not provided with security awareness training upon onboarding. This leaves new hires vulnerable to common social engineering attacks such as phishing, pretexting, and malware, as they may not be aware of the organization's specific security protocols, threats, and best practices from day one. This oversight increases the overall risk posture during the critical initial employment phase.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New Employees</li><li>Onboarding Process</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Windows Policy - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Several workstations within the organization are running Windows 7, an operating system that reached its end-of-life in January 2020. This means these systems no longer receive security updates, patches, or technical support from Microsoft, making them highly susceptible to known vulnerabilities, exploits, and malware. Continued use of Windows 7 poses a critical risk to the entire network's security.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediate action is required to address the identified vulnerabilities. Firstly, the anonymous FTP login must be disabled, and the FTP service should be secured, ideally by migrating to SFTP or FTPS for encrypted data transfer. Secondly, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be implemented across all sensitive data systems to significantly enhance access security. The organization should also develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to guide proper IT resource usage and mitigate internal risks. Furthermore, mandatory security awareness training should be integrated into the onboarding process for all new employees to ensure they are equipped with essential security knowledge from the start. Most critically, all workstations running Windows 7 must be upgraded to a currently supported operating system, such as Windows 10 or 11, to ensure they receive vital security updates and patches.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces a significant cybersecurity risk posture due to a combination of critical technical vulnerabilities and gaps in security policies and training. The presence of an anonymous FTP server and end-of-life Windows 7 workstations represents immediate and severe threats that could lead to data breaches or system compromise. The lack of MFA for sensitive data systems, an acceptable use policy, and initial security training for new employees further exacerbates these risks. While annual security training is a positive step, the identified deficiencies indicate a need for urgent and comprehensive security enhancements to improve overall readiness and protect critical assets.</p>
