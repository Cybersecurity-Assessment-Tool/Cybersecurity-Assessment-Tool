        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems, and by having an employee acceptable use policy in place. However, significant gaps exist in critical areas. There is no MFA requirement for computer logins, which exposes a major vulnerability for endpoint access. Furthermore, the organization lacks both initial security awareness training for new employees and recurring annual training for all staff, leaving the human element susceptible to various cyber threats. While the network scan data provided is minimal, an identified vulnerability points to an unencrypted web server, indicating potential data exposure.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unencrypted Web Server - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Port 80 is reported as open, indicating the presence of an unencrypted web server. This allows for cleartext communication, making any data transmitted over this port vulnerable to interception, eavesdropping, and manipulation by malicious actors. This was identified by detecting an open port 80.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee workstations and internal systems if credentials are stolen, phished, or compromised, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Login systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of New Employee Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. This leaves new hires potentially unaware of critical security policies, best practices, and common threats such as phishing, social engineering, and malware, increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. Without regular refreshers, employees may forget best practices, become complacent, or remain unaware of evolving cyber threats, making the organization more susceptible to human-factor attacks and compliance failures. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately address the unencrypted web server by either closing port 80 if it's not essential, or by implementing SSL/TLS encryption for any services running on it. Crucially, the organization must implement mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to significantly enhance endpoint security. Furthermore, establishing comprehensive security awareness training programs is paramount: a mandatory program for all new employees during onboarding and a recurring annual training program for all staff to ensure continuous education on evolving threats and best practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has taken positive steps by implementing MFA for email and sensitive data, and by having an acceptable use policy, its current security posture is significantly undermined by critical vulnerabilities. The lack of MFA for computer logins and the complete absence of security awareness training for both new and existing employees represent substantial risks that could lead to unauthorized access and successful cyberattacks. Addressing these fundamental gaps is essential for improving the organization's overall readiness and resilience against modern cyber threats.</p>
