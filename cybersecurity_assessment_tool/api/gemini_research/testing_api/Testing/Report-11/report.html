        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an active host with an open SSH port (22). While email access requires MFA, critical security gaps exist in user authentication and training. Specifically, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for logging into computers or accessing sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization lacks both initial security awareness training for new employees and annual refresher training for all staff. An acceptable use policy is in place.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The system has an exposed localhost interface, which could allow unauthorized access or information disclosure if not properly secured. This was identified from the provided 'Current Risks' data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are compromised, as a single factor (password) is sufficient. This was identified from the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers</li><li>User login processes</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if user credentials are stolen or guessed, as a single factor is sufficient for access. This was identified from the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases containing sensitive information</li><li>Applications handling sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No New Employee Security Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. This means new hires may not be aware of common cyber threats, organizational security policies, or best practices, making them more susceptible to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) and increasing the risk of human error leading to security incidents. This was identified from the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Annual Security Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. Regular training is crucial to keep employees updated on evolving threats, reinforce security best practices, and maintain a strong security culture. The absence of such training increases the likelihood of employees falling victim to sophisticated attacks and making security mistakes. This was identified from the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port (22) - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The network scan identified an open SSH (port 22) service. While SSH is a legitimate service for remote administration, an open port represents an attack surface. If not properly secured with strong authentication (e.g., key-based authentication, MFA) and restricted access controls, it could be exploited for brute-force attacks or unauthorized remote access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with open port 22</li><li>SSH service</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and, critically, for access to all sensitive data systems. The exposed localhost interface should be immediately reviewed and secured, potentially by restricting access or ensuring it's not externally reachable. The open SSH port (22) requires immediate attention to ensure it is secured with strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., SSH keys, MFA) and strict access control lists (ACLs) to limit exposure. Additionally, a comprehensive security awareness training program must be established, including mandatory training for all new employees upon onboarding and annual refresher training for all existing staff to foster a security-conscious culture and reduce human-factor risks. Regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing should be conducted to identify and address further potential exposures.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant security vulnerabilities, primarily stemming from a lack of robust authentication mechanisms for critical systems and an absence of comprehensive security awareness training. While an acceptable use policy is present, the lack of MFA for computer and sensitive data system access, coupled with an open SSH port and an exposed localhost, creates substantial attack surfaces. The absence of regular security training further exacerbates these risks by increasing the likelihood of human error and successful social engineering attacks. Addressing these fundamental gaps is paramount to improving the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and readiness against evolving threats.</p>
