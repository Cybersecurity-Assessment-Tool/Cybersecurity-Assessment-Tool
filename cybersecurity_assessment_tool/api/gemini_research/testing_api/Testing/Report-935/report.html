        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open port 22 (SSH), indicating a potential entry point that requires secure configuration. Furthermore, the organization exhibits significant weaknesses in its security posture, notably the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and computer logins. While MFA is utilized for sensitive data systems, its lack in other critical areas increases the risk of unauthorized access. The organization also lacks a comprehensive security awareness training program for both new and existing employees, which is a critical gap in fostering a security-conscious culture. An acceptable use policy is in place, which is a positive step, but overall, the current readiness is low due to critical vulnerabilities and insufficient security controls.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A critical internal service, intended to be accessible only from the local machine (localhost), has been inadvertently exposed to the network. This exposure, identified through network analysis, allows unauthorized access to the service from external sources, bypassing intended security boundaries. The impact of this vulnerability is severe, potentially leading to full system compromise, data exfiltration, or disruption of critical operations, as it grants an attacker direct access to a highly privileged internal component.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is imperative to immediately investigate the 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability. Ensure that all critical services are correctly bound to their intended interfaces and that firewall rules strictly enforce access control, preventing external reachability to internal-only services. For the open port 22 (SSH), implement strong authentication mechanisms, disable password-based authentication in favor of key-based authentication, and restrict access to trusted IP addresses. Furthermore, implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, including email systems and computer logins, to significantly enhance user authentication security. Establish and enforce mandatory security awareness training for all new employees and conduct annual refresher training for all staff to educate them on common threats, best practices, and the importance of their role in maintaining security.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces a critical security vulnerability with an internal service being inadvertently exposed to the network, posing an immediate and severe risk of compromise. This, coupled with significant gaps in foundational security controls such as the widespread absence of MFA and a lack of regular security awareness training, indicates a low overall security readiness. Addressing these issues promptly through technical remediation and robust security policies is crucial to prevent potential breaches and enhance the organization's defensive posture.</p>
