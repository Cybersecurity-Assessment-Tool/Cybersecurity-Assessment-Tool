        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization currently lacks multi-factor authentication (MFA) across critical access points including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. While an acceptable use policy is in place and new employees receive security awareness training, there is no annual security awareness training for all employees, indicating significant gaps in their security posture.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee inboxes if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. A single compromised email account can lead to further internal network penetration, data exfiltration, or business email compromise (BEC) scams. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>User accounts</li><li>Sensitive communications</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication is not enforced for logging into organizational computers. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if user credentials are stolen or guessed. Attackers gaining access to a computer can potentially move laterally within the network, install malware, or access sensitive local data. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All organizational computers</li><li>User accounts</li><li>Internal network access</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Access to systems containing sensitive data does not require Multi-Factor Authentication. This is a critical security gap, as it means that a simple username and password are the only barriers protecting highly confidential information. A breach of these systems could lead to severe data loss, regulatory fines, reputational damage, and significant financial impact. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>Confidential information repositories</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This results in a decaying knowledge base regarding current threats, best practices, and organizational policies. Employees who are not regularly updated on security risks (e.g., new phishing techniques, social engineering tactics) are more susceptible to falling victim to attacks, thereby increasing the overall human risk factor for the organization. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li><li>Incident response capabilities</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, including email systems, computer logins, and especially sensitive data systems, to significantly enhance credential security. Establish and enforce a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees to ensure continuous education on evolving cyber threats and best practices, reinforcing a strong security culture. Regularly review and update security policies and procedures to align with current threat landscapes.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant security risks primarily due to the widespread absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for critical access points and the lack of ongoing, annual security awareness training for its workforce. While some foundational elements like an acceptable use policy and initial new hire training are present, these gaps leave the organization highly vulnerable to credential-based attacks and human error, indicating a moderate to low state of readiness against sophisticated cyber threats. Addressing these fundamental issues is paramount to improving the overall security posture and protecting sensitive assets.</p>
