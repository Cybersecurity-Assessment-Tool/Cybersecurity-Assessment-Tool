        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The network scan identified an active host with an open SSH port (22). Organizational data indicates a critical lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA) across key access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. While the organization has an acceptable use policy and conducts regular security awareness training, the absence of MFA and the presence of an open SSH port represent significant vulnerabilities that could be exploited.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email, logging into computers, or accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly elevates the risk of unauthorized access in the event of compromised credentials (e.g., through phishing, brute-force attacks, or malware). Without MFA, a single stolen password can grant an attacker full access to critical systems and data, potentially leading to data breaches, financial losses, and severe reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email systems</li><li>Employee workstations/laptops</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port (22) - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH port (22) was detected on a host within the network. While SSH is a legitimate and secure protocol for remote access, an open port without stringent security configurations (such as strong key-based authentication, IP whitelisting, rate limiting, and disabling root login) is a common target for brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or exploitation of SSH vulnerabilities. Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized remote access, command execution, and lateral movement within the network.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with open port 22</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediately implement and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, as this is the most critical step to mitigate credential-based attacks. For the identified open SSH port, ensure robust security measures are in place, such as using strong key-based authentication, disabling root login, implementing IP whitelisting for authorized sources, and configuring rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks. Regularly patch SSH servers and consider changing the default SSH port. Additionally, conduct regular vulnerability scans and penetration tests to proactively identify and remediate new and existing security weaknesses across the network.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces substantial cybersecurity risks primarily due to the critical absence of multi-factor authentication across essential access points and the presence of an open SSH port. While the organization has an acceptable use policy and conducts security awareness training, these measures alone are insufficient to defend against modern credential-based attacks and potential exploitation of network services. Addressing these critical vulnerabilities by implementing MFA and securing network services is paramount to significantly enhancing the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and readiness against evolving threats.</p>
