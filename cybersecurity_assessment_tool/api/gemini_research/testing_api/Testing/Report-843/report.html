        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to identity and access management by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization conducts security awareness training for new employees and annually for all staff, which is a positive step towards fostering a security-conscious culture. However, a critical vulnerability was identified: an open MySQL port (3306) on the network, which exposes the database service to potential external threats. Additionally, the organization currently lacks an employee acceptable use policy, which is a foundational element for defining expected employee behavior regarding IT resource usage and security.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network. This exposure allows external entities to potentially connect to the database service, increasing the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, data manipulation, or denial-of-service attacks. This vulnerability was identified through a network scan that detected the open MySQL port.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified database exposure risk, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted internal IP addresses or specific authorized hosts. For a more robust long-term solution, consider placing the database behind a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or implementing a secure bastion host for all database access. Furthermore, it is crucial to develop and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to clearly define guidelines for the proper use of organizational IT resources and data, ensuring employees understand their responsibilities in maintaining security.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has established good practices in MFA implementation and security awareness training, the presence of an open MySQL port represents a significant and critical vulnerability that could lead to severe data compromise. The absence of an acceptable use policy also indicates a gap in foundational security governance. Addressing the open database port with immediate firewall rules and a long-term VPN solution, alongside developing an acceptable use policy, are paramount steps to enhance the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and readiness against potential threats.</p>
