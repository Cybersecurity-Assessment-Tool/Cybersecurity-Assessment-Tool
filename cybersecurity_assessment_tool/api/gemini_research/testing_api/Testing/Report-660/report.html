        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's current security posture, based on the provided organizational data, indicates a significant reliance on single-factor authentication across critical access points including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. While the organization does conduct security awareness training for both new and existing employees annually, a formal employee acceptable use policy is not in place. Due to broken input for network scan data and specific vulnerabilities, a comprehensive technical assessment of network-level risks and specific system vulnerabilities could not be performed. The assessment is therefore limited to policy and access control deficiencies identified from the organizational data.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email inboxes if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. A successful compromise could lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, or further lateral movement within the network. This was identified directly from the organizational data stating 'Do you require MFA to access email?':'No'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email accounts</li><li>Email servers</li><li>User credentials</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for employees to log into their computers. This exposes endpoints to a higher risk of unauthorized access should a user's login credentials be stolen or guessed. Without a second factor, an attacker with valid credentials can gain direct access to an employee's workstation, potentially accessing local files, network resources, and installing malware. This was identified directly from the organizational data stating 'Do you require MFA to log into computers?':'No'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Domain controllers</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to systems containing sensitive data. This is a critical vulnerability as it means that a single compromised password could grant an attacker access to the organization's most valuable and confidential information. The impact could range from regulatory non-compliance and financial penalties to severe reputational damage and loss of intellectual property. This was identified directly from the organizational data stating 'Do you require MFA to access sensitive data systems?':'No'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>Cloud storage</li><li>Critical applications</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy (AUP). Without a clear AUP, employees may not fully understand their responsibilities regarding the use of company assets, data, and network resources. This can lead to unintentional security breaches, misuse of company property, and increased legal and compliance risks. An AUP provides a framework for acceptable behavior and helps enforce security best practices. This was identified directly from the organizational data stating 'Does your organization have an employee acceptable use policy?':'No'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company assets</li><li>Network resources</li><li>Data handling procedures</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, immediate implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is strongly recommended across all critical access points. This includes enforcing MFA for email access, computer logins, and especially for all systems handling sensitive data. Furthermore, the organization should develop and implement a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) that clearly outlines expectations for employee behavior regarding company assets, data, and network usage. This policy should be communicated to all employees and integrated into the existing security awareness training program. Regular reviews and updates of the AUP are also crucial to ensure its continued relevance and effectiveness. While security awareness training is already in place, incorporating these new policies and the importance of MFA into the training will further strengthen the human element of security.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The current assessment reveals critical vulnerabilities stemming from the widespread absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. This significantly elevates the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. The lack of a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) also presents a notable risk by potentially fostering inconsistent security practices among employees. While the organization demonstrates a positive commitment to security awareness training, these foundational policy and access control gaps must be addressed to achieve a robust security posture. A comprehensive technical assessment was not possible due to broken input, but the identified risks from organizational data alone indicate a need for urgent security enhancements.</p>
