        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's current cybersecurity posture reveals significant vulnerabilities across several critical areas. Network scans identified an open SSH port (22), which, if not properly secured, presents a high risk for unauthorized access. More critically, the organization lacks fundamental security controls such as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, leaving these primary access points highly susceptible to compromise. Furthermore, there is a complete absence of an employee acceptable use policy and regular security awareness training for both new and existing employees, indicating a substantial human element risk. A critical 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability was also noted, suggesting potential internal service misconfigurations or unintended accessibility. While MFA is used for sensitive data systems, the overall lack of foundational security practices creates a highly vulnerable environment.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unsecured SSH Service (Port 22 Open) - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH port (22) was detected on a host. While SSH is a legitimate service, if not properly secured with strong authentication (e.g., key-based authentication, disabled password login) and restricted access, it can be a significant attack vector for brute-force attacks or unauthorized access. This was identified via Nmap scan.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with open port 22</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for email access. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks, as a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's email, potentially leading to further internal system access or data exfiltration. This was identified from organizational policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>All employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for logging into computers. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if passwords are stolen or weak. An attacker gaining access to a computer can move laterally within the network, access sensitive data, or deploy malware. This was identified from organizational policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers</li><li>Network endpoints</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines, employees may engage in activities that inadvertently introduce security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling company data, leading to potential data breaches or system compromises. This was identified from organizational policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training. This leaves them unprepared to identify and respond to common cyber threats like phishing, social engineering, and malware, making them easy targets for attackers and increasing the likelihood of initial compromise. This was identified from organizational policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Infrequent Security Awareness Training for All Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. Without regular refreshers, employees may forget best practices, become complacent, or fail to recognize evolving threats, leading to a degradation of the human firewall and increased susceptibility to cyberattacks. This was identified from organizational policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A critical vulnerability identified as 'Localhost Exposed' indicates that an internal service or system, intended for local access only, is potentially accessible from external or unauthorized internal sources. This could lead to unauthorized data access, service manipulation, or further compromise of the internal network. The exact nature requires further investigation, but its critical severity suggests immediate attention.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Internal Network Services</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, the organization must prioritize implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email and computer login systems immediately. For the open SSH port, ensure it is secured with strong, key-based authentication, disable password logins, and restrict access to only necessary IP addresses. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to guide employee behavior regarding IT assets and data. Crucially, establish a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees and conduct annual refresher training for the entire workforce to educate them on identifying and responding to cyber threats. The 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability requires immediate investigation to identify the specific service or system affected and implement appropriate access controls or isolation measures.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces a high level of cybersecurity risk due to critical gaps in authentication protocols, employee training, and policy enforcement. While some sensitive data systems are protected by MFA, the widespread absence of MFA for email and computer access, coupled with a lack of security awareness and an acceptable use policy, creates significant attack vectors. The presence of an open SSH port and a 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability further compounds the risk. The organization's readiness is currently low, necessitating urgent and comprehensive action to implement foundational security controls and foster a security-conscious culture to protect against potential breaches and data loss.</p>
