        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes a MySQL database (version 5.7.33) on port 3306, indicating a potential direct access vulnerability. Furthermore, the organization exhibits significant gaps in its security posture regarding user authentication and policy enforcement. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for accessing email, logging into computers, or accessing sensitive data systems, which dramatically increases the risk of unauthorized access upon credential compromise. The absence of an employee acceptable use policy leaves the organization vulnerable to misuse of IT resources and inconsistent security practices. While new employees receive security awareness training, the lack of annual training for all employees suggests a potential decay in security awareness over time, leaving the workforce susceptible to evolving threats.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network. This exposes the database to potential unauthorized access, data breaches, and service disruption if not properly secured. The vulnerability was identified through a network scan showing an open MySQL port.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for email access, computer logins, or sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are compromised, as a single factor (password) is the only barrier. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email systems</li><li>Computer logins</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines, employees may engage in activities that introduce security risks, such as improper use of company resources, unauthorized software installations, or unsafe browsing habits. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, there is no annual training for all employees. This means employees may not be updated on the latest threats, best practices, or evolving company policies, leading to a degradation of security posture over time. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from authorized internal IP addresses or specific application servers. For long-term security, consider placing the database behind a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or utilizing secure tunneling. Crucially, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be implemented across all critical systems, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data access, to significantly enhance protection against credential compromise. Furthermore, the organization should develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy, ensuring all employees are trained on and adhere to its guidelines. Finally, establish a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees to ensure continuous education on current threats, best practices, and evolving company security policies.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several significant cybersecurity vulnerabilities, including an exposed MySQL database and critical gaps in its authentication and policy frameworks. The absence of MFA for key systems, lack of an acceptable use policy, and insufficient annual security awareness training collectively indicate a low level of cybersecurity readiness. Addressing these issues promptly through the recommended technical and policy-based controls is essential to reduce the risk of data breaches, unauthorized access, and operational disruptions, thereby improving the overall security posture.</p>
