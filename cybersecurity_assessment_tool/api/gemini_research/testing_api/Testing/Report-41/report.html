        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes an RDP service on port 3389, indicating a potential external attack surface. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is utilized for email and sensitive data systems, it is notably absent for computer logins. Furthermore, the organization has an acceptable use policy in place but lacks crucial security awareness training for both new hires and existing employees on an annual basis.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>RDP Exposure - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed externally on port 3389. This allows direct access attempts to internal systems, significantly increasing the risk of unauthorized access, brute-force attacks, or exploitation of RDP vulnerabilities, potentially leading to system compromise or data breaches. This was identified through a network port scan showing an open RDP service.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP address with open port 3389</li><li>ms-wbt-server service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This significantly weakens the security posture, as compromised credentials (e.g., through phishing or malware) could grant an attacker full access to an employee's workstation and potentially the internal network without an additional authentication factor. This was identified through a review of organizational security policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers</li><li>Authentication systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees, nor does it provide annual training for all employees. This leaves the workforce vulnerable to social engineering attacks, phishing campaigns, and other human-factor exploits, increasing the likelihood of successful cyberattacks that bypass technical controls. This was identified through a review of organizational security policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately close port 3389 if RDP access is not essential. If RDP access is required, implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) with mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all connections, and restrict RDP access to only trusted IP addresses via firewall rules. Furthermore, implement and enforce MFA for all computer logins across the organization to significantly enhance account security. A comprehensive security awareness training program should be established for all new employees, with mandatory annual refresher training for all staff, covering topics such as phishing, social engineering, and secure computing practices. Regular security policy reviews and vulnerability assessments are also advised.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces critical vulnerabilities, primarily due to an exposed RDP service and significant gaps in its security posture, including the absence of MFA for computer logins and a lack of comprehensive security awareness training. While some foundational security elements like MFA for sensitive systems and an acceptable use policy are in place, these critical weaknesses leave the organization highly susceptible to various cyber threats. Immediate action is required to address these findings and enhance the overall cybersecurity readiness.</p>
