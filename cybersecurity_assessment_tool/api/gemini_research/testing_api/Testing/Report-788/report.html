        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to cybersecurity through its employee acceptable use policy and regular security awareness training. However, critical security gaps exist, particularly concerning Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) implementation. An open port 80 was identified, indicating a web service that may lack proper encryption or access controls. While MFA is required for computer logins, its absence for email and sensitive data systems significantly elevates the risk of account compromise and unauthorized data access.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of email account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. A compromised email account can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and further lateral movement within the network, impacting business operations and data integrity. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on email access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are stolen or guessed. It bypasses a crucial layer of security that would prevent attackers from accessing sensitive information even if they obtain a user's password, potentially leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and reputational damage. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on sensitive data systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open Port 80 (HTTP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open port 80 was detected on the network, indicating that a web server is running and potentially serving content over unencrypted HTTP. This poses a risk of data interception (e.g., credentials, sensitive information) if not properly secured with HTTPS. It also presents a potential attack surface for web-based vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS) if the web application is not robustly secured. This was identified via the Nmap scan data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li><li>Web Server</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and sensitive data systems. This is a critical step to protect against phishing, credential theft, and unauthorized access to vital information. For the open port 80, ensure all web services utilize HTTPS for encrypted communication to protect data in transit. If the web server is not intended for public access, restrict its accessibility to internal networks only. Regularly review and update security policies, including the acceptable use policy, to reflect current best practices and continue to reinforce security awareness training with specific emphasis on phishing threats and the importance of MFA.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has a commendable foundation in security awareness training and policy implementation, its current cybersecurity readiness is significantly hampered by critical vulnerabilities. The absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for email and sensitive data systems, coupled with an open and potentially unencrypted web service on port 80, exposes the organization to a high risk of account compromise, data breaches, and unauthorized access. Addressing these MFA gaps and securing web services are paramount to substantially improving the organization's overall security posture and protecting its valuable assets.</p>
