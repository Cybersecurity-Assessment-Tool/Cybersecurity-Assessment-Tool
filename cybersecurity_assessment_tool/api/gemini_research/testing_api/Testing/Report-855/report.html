        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently has a MySQL database server running version 5.7.33 with port 3306 open. From an organizational security standpoint, MFA is required for email and sensitive data systems, but not for computer logins. The organization has an acceptable use policy and conducts annual security awareness training for all employees, but new employees do not receive specific security awareness training upon onboarding.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The MySQL database server, running version 5.7.33, has its default port 3306 open to the network. This exposure could allow unauthorized access to the database if not properly secured, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized data modification, or denial of service. This vulnerability was identified through network scanning which revealed the open port and service version.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted IP addresses or internal networks. For long-term security, consider placing the database behind a VPN or implementing a more robust access control mechanism. Additionally, it is crucial to enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to enhance endpoint security. Furthermore, establish a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees during their onboarding process to ensure they are aware of security best practices from day one.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational level of security readiness with MFA for critical systems and annual security training. However, the open MySQL port presents a significant vulnerability that requires immediate attention. The lack of MFA for computer logins and specific security training for new employees also indicates areas where the organization's security posture can be substantially improved to reduce overall risk.</p>
