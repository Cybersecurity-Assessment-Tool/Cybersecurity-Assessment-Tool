        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an Nginx web server (version 1.18.0) listening on port 443 (HTTPS). This indicates a public-facing web service. The organization has some good security practices in place, such as requiring MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, and having an acceptable use policy and security awareness training for new employees. However, critical gaps exist in email security and ongoing employee training.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access email. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts through credential stuffing, phishing, or brute-force attacks. A compromised email account can serve as a gateway for further network penetration, data exfiltration, and business email compromise (BEC) scams. This vulnerability was identified through the organization's self-reported security posture.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>All employee email accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Infrequent Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. This leaves employees susceptible to evolving social engineering tactics, phishing attempts, and malware distribution methods. Without regular updates on current threats and best practices, the human element becomes a significant vulnerability, increasing the likelihood of successful cyberattacks. This vulnerability was identified through the organization's self-reported security posture.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Nginx Web Server - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nginx web server identified on port 443 is running version 1.18.0. This version is outdated and may contain known security vulnerabilities that have been addressed in newer releases. Running an unpatched or end-of-life web server exposes the organization to various exploits, including remote code execution, denial-of-service attacks, and information disclosure, potentially compromising the integrity and availability of hosted web services. This vulnerability was identified via network scan data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Nginx web server (version 1.18.0)</li><li>Port 443</li><li>Hosted web applications</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access to prevent unauthorized account compromise. Furthermore, a comprehensive and mandatory annual security awareness training program should be established for all employees to ensure they are continuously updated on the latest cyber threats and best practices. Finally, the Nginx web server should be updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities and improve overall security posture. Regular patching and vulnerability management processes should be established for all public-facing services.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of cybersecurity by implementing MFA for sensitive systems and initial employee training, significant vulnerabilities remain. The lack of MFA for email, infrequent security awareness training, and the use of an outdated web server present considerable risks that could lead to data breaches, operational disruptions, and reputational damage. Addressing these critical areas will substantially enhance the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and resilience against modern threats.</p>
