        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The network scan data indicates that no open ports were identified on the scanned hosts, suggesting a potentially secure external perimeter. However, the organizational data reveals several internal security posture weaknesses. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for email and computer logins, it is notably absent for sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees, indicating gaps in both policy enforcement and ongoing human-centric security measures.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if primary credentials are compromised (e.g., via phishing or brute-force attacks). Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to sensitive data. This was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks an employee acceptable use policy (AUP). An AUP is crucial for defining expected employee behavior regarding company IT resources, data handling, and internet usage. Its absence can lead to inconsistent security practices, increased risk of data breaches due to misuse or negligence, and difficulty in enforcing disciplinary actions for security policy violations. This was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Recurring Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This creates a significant gap in maintaining a strong security culture and ensuring employees are continuously updated on evolving threats (e.g., new phishing techniques, social engineering tactics). Without regular refreshers, employees may forget best practices, increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents. This was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>IT systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization implements Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to enhance protection against unauthorized access. A comprehensive employee acceptable use policy (AUP) should be developed and enforced to clearly define expected behavior regarding IT resource usage and data handling. Furthermore, the organization must establish a program for mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees to ensure continuous education on current threats and best practices, thereby strengthening the human element of security.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization exhibits a mixed security posture. While network scans did not reveal immediate external vulnerabilities and MFA is used for email and computer logins, critical gaps exist in protecting sensitive data systems with MFA, establishing foundational security policies like an Acceptable Use Policy, and maintaining ongoing security awareness through annual training for all staff. Addressing these areas is crucial for enhancing overall cybersecurity readiness and reducing the risk of internal and external threats.</p>
