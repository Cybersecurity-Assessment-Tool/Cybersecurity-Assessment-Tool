            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization exhibits a mixed security posture. While strong foundational controls such as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) are implemented for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, and an acceptable use policy is in place, several critical vulnerabilities and gaps in security practices were identified. These include an outdated FTP server allowing anonymous access, workstations running an end-of-life operating system (Windows 7), and a significant lack of security awareness training for both new and existing employees. These issues collectively expose the organization to potential data breaches, malware infections, and social engineering attacks.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Anonymous FTP Access",
                        "Overview": "An Nmap scan identified an open FTP service (vsftpd version 2.3.4) on port 21, which allows anonymous login. This configuration permits unauthorized users to access and potentially modify files on the FTP server without authentication. This could lead to data exfiltration, data integrity issues, or even system compromise if sensitive information is stored or if write access is inadvertently enabled. The vsftpd version 2.3.4 is also an outdated version with known vulnerabilities.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "FTP Server (vsftpd 2.3.4 on port 21)"

                    {
                        "Risk": "Outdated Operating System",
                        "Overview": "Several workstations within the organization are running Windows 7, an operating system that has reached its end-of-life. This means these systems no longer receive critical security updates, making them highly susceptible to known exploits, malware, and zero-day vulnerabilities. The lack of patches significantly increases the risk of successful cyberattacks, leading to system compromise, data loss, or network lateral movement. The CVSS score of 5.0 indicates a medium severity.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Workstations running Windows 7"
                        ]

                    {
                        "Risk": "Insufficient Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "The organization currently does not conduct security awareness training for new employees, nor does it provide annual training for all employees. This critical gap significantly elevates the risk of successful phishing attacks, social engineering, and other human-factor vulnerabilities. Employees who are unaware of current threats and best security practices are more likely to fall victim to scams, inadvertently expose sensitive information, or introduce malware into the network, thereby compromising the overall security posture.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "Organizational data",
                            "Network infrastructure"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately disable anonymous FTP access and ensure the FTP server software is updated to a currently supported and secure version, or replaced with a more secure file transfer solution. All workstations running Windows 7 must be upgraded to a supported operating system, such as Windows 10 or 11, or the underlying hardware should be refitted to accommodate newer OS versions. Furthermore, a comprehensive security awareness training program must be implemented for all new employees upon onboarding and conducted annually for the entire staff. This training should cover current threats, phishing recognition, secure browsing habits, and data handling best practices. Regular vulnerability scanning, patch management, and a robust incident response plan should also be established to proactively identify and address future security weaknesses and respond effectively to incidents.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces several high-impact security vulnerabilities, primarily stemming from outdated and misconfigured software, and a critical gap in employee security education. While some foundational security measures like MFA are in place, the identified risks significantly compromise the overall security readiness. Addressing these issues, particularly the anonymous FTP access, end-of-life operating systems, and the absence of security awareness training, is paramount to reducing the organization's exposure to cyber threats and substantially improving its defensive posture."
