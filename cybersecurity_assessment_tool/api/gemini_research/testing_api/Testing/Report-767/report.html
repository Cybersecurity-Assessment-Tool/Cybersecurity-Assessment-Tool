        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open SSH port (22), indicating a potential entry point for attackers if not properly secured. Furthermore, a review of organizational policies highlighted significant gaps in security posture. The organization currently does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access, computer logins, or sensitive data systems, leaving critical assets vulnerable to credential-based attacks. There is also a lack of an employee acceptable use policy, which can lead to inconsistent security practices among staff. While new employees receive security awareness training, annual training for all employees is not conducted, suggesting a potential for outdated security knowledge and increased susceptibility to evolving threats.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This vulnerability, identified with a critical CVSS score of 10.0, indicates that internal services or configurations are improperly exposed, potentially allowing unauthorized access to critical system components or data. The specific nature of the exposure requires immediate investigation to prevent severe compromise.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The absence of MFA for email access significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee inboxes. Phishing attacks or credential stuffing could compromise accounts, leading to data breaches, business email compromise (BEC), and further network penetration. This was identified by the organization stating they do not require MFA for email.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Without MFA for computer logins, compromised credentials (e.g., via keyloggers, brute-force attacks) can grant attackers direct access to internal workstations. This allows for lateral movement, data exfiltration, and malware deployment, posing a severe threat to the internal network. This was identified by the organization stating they do not require MFA to log into computers.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations</li><li>Internal network</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The absence of MFA on systems containing sensitive data is a critical vulnerability. If an attacker gains access to credentials for these systems, they can directly access and exfiltrate highly confidential information without an additional layer of security, leading to severe regulatory fines, reputational damage, and operational disruption. This was identified by the organization stating they do not require MFA to access sensitive data systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>Cloud storage</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Without a formal acceptable use policy, employees may unknowingly engage in activities that introduce security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling company data. This lack of clear guidelines increases the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents. This was identified by the organization stating they do not have an acceptable use policy.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive training, the lack of annual security awareness training for all employees means that knowledge can become outdated, and new threats may not be communicated effectively. This leaves the organization vulnerable to evolving social engineering tactics, phishing, and other human-centric attacks. This was identified by the organization stating they do not do security awareness training for all employees at least once per year.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port (22) Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nmap scan identified an open SSH (Secure Shell) port 22. While SSH is a secure protocol for remote access, an open port represents an attack surface. Without proper hardening (e.g., strong passwords, key-based authentication, MFA, IP restrictions), this port could be targeted by brute-force attacks or credential stuffing, potentially leading to unauthorized remote access to the system.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Network perimeter</li><li>System with open port 22</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is imperative to immediately investigate and remediate the 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability, which carries a critical severity. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, including email systems, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, to significantly enhance credential security. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to establish clear guidelines for secure behavior and data handling. Furthermore, establish a program for mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees to ensure up-to-date knowledge of cybersecurity threats and best practices. For the open SSH port 22, ensure it is secured with strong, key-based authentication, disable password authentication, implement IP-based access restrictions, and ideally, integrate MFA for SSH access. Regularly review and audit network configurations and access controls to prevent similar exposures.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several critical and high-severity vulnerabilities stemming from both network configurations and significant policy gaps. The lack of MFA across key access points, coupled with an open SSH port and insufficient security awareness training, creates a substantial attack surface. Addressing these issues promptly through technical controls and policy enforcement is crucial to improving the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and protecting against potential breaches and data loss.</p>
