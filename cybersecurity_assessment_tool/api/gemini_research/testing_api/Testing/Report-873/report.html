        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open port 8080, which was identified as a 'TOP SECRET DB' but later confirmed as a false positive and secured. However, a review of organizational data indicates significant vulnerabilities related to authentication and ongoing security education. Specifically, the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, coupled with insufficient recurring security awareness training for all employees, poses considerable risks to the organization's overall security posture.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing employee email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. A successful compromise could lead to data breaches, business email compromise (BEC) scams, and further lateral movement within the network. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email accounts</li><li>Email server/service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This leaves internal systems vulnerable to unauthorized access if employee login credentials are stolen or guessed. Attackers could gain direct access to workstations, potentially leading to data exfiltration, malware deployment, or privilege escalation. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network access points</li><li>Active Directory/Identity Provider</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Recurring Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. While new employees receive training, the lack of regular, recurring training means employees may forget best practices, become complacent, or not be updated on new threats. This increases the organization's susceptibility to social engineering attacks, phishing, and other human-factor vulnerabilities over time. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and computer logins immediately. This critical step will significantly enhance protection against credential theft and unauthorized access. Furthermore, a comprehensive and mandatory annual security awareness training program should be established for all employees, not just new hires. This training should cover current threat landscapes, phishing recognition, social engineering tactics, and best practices for data handling to ensure a continuously informed and vigilant workforce.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for critical access points like email and computer logins, alongside a gap in recurring security awareness training for its entire workforce. While an initial network scan did not reveal immediate external vulnerabilities, the internal policy deficiencies present a high potential for compromise through human factors and credential-based attacks. Addressing these fundamental security hygiene issues is paramount to improving the organization's overall readiness against cyber threats.</p>
