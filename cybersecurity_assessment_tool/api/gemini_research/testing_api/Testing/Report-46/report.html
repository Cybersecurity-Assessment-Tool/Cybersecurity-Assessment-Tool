        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's current security posture, based on the provided organizational data, reveals several critical areas requiring immediate attention. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is utilized for computer logins, its absence for email and sensitive data systems presents significant vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the lack of an employee acceptable use policy and initial security awareness training for new employees indicates gaps in foundational security practices and human factor risk management. No network scan data or existing technical vulnerabilities were provided, so the assessment focuses on policy and access control deficiencies.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing employee email accounts. This significantly elevates the risk of unauthorized access to email if credentials are compromised through phishing, credential stuffing, or other attack vectors. A compromised email account can serve as a gateway for further internal system breaches, data exfiltration, and sophisticated social engineering attacks like Business Email Compromise (BEC).</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee email accounts</li><li>Organizational communication</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for accessing systems that contain sensitive organizational data. This exposes critical information to unauthorized access if a single authentication factor (e.g., a password) is compromised. Successful exploitation could lead to severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, significant financial losses, and severe reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>Applications handling confidential information</li><li>Critical business processes</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). Without a clear AUP, employees may be unaware of the guidelines and responsibilities regarding the proper use of company IT resources, data handling, internet usage, and communication channels. This absence increases the likelihood of misuse of company assets, accidental data leakage, exposure to malware, and potential legal liabilities arising from inappropriate online behavior or data handling practices.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT infrastructure</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Legal and compliance posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive dedicated security awareness training as part of their onboarding process. This means new hires may lack fundamental knowledge about identifying and responding to common cyber threats such as phishing, social engineering, and malware. This oversight increases the organization's susceptibility to human-factor attacks during a critical period when employees are learning new systems and processes, potentially before they receive any annual training.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li><li>Risk of social engineering and phishing attacks</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all email accounts and sensitive data systems immediately. This will provide a crucial layer of defense against credential compromise. Concurrently, the organization must develop and enforce a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) to clearly define expectations for IT resource usage and data handling. Furthermore, a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees should be integrated into the onboarding process, ensuring foundational cybersecurity knowledge from day one. The existing annual security awareness training for all employees should continue to reinforce best practices and address emerging threats.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces substantial cybersecurity risks stemming from critical gaps in access control and foundational security policies. The absence of MFA for email and sensitive data systems, combined with the lack of an acceptable use policy and initial security awareness training for new hires, creates significant vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors. While annual security training is a positive step, these unaddressed areas leave the organization susceptible to credential compromise, data breaches, and human error. Proactive implementation of the recommended security controls and policies is essential to elevate the overall security posture and improve readiness against prevalent cyber threats.</p>
