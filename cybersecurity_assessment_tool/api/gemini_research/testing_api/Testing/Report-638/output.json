                "Summary": "The organization's network scan revealed an active host with an open FTP service (vsftpd 2.3.4) allowing anonymous login. Internally, the organization implements MFA for email and computer logins, and has an acceptable use policy and new employee security awareness training. However, MFA is not enforced for sensitive data systems, and annual security awareness training for all employees is not conducted. Furthermore, workstations are running an outdated operating system (Windows 7).",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Outdated Operating System",
                        "Overview": "Workstations are currently running Windows 7, which has reached its end-of-life. This means it no longer receives security updates, leaving systems vulnerable to known exploits and increasing the risk of malware infection and data breaches.",

                        "Risk": "Anonymous FTP Access Allowed",
                        "Overview": "The network scan identified an FTP server (vsftpd 2.3.4) configured to allow anonymous login. This configuration can lead to unauthorized access to files, potential data exfiltration, or the injection of malicious content onto the server, compromising data integrity and confidentiality.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "FTP Server (vsftpd 2.3.4)"

                    {
                        "Risk": "No MFA for Sensitive Data Systems",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if user credentials are compromised through phishing, keylogging, or other attack vectors, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                    {
                        "Risk": "Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual training for all employees. This leaves the workforce susceptible to evolving cyber threats, as employees may not be updated on the latest phishing techniques, social engineering tactics, or internal security policies, increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "Organizational security posture"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to upgrade all workstations from Windows 7 to a currently supported operating system like Windows 10 or 11 to ensure ongoing security updates and patches. The FTP server should be reconfigured immediately to disable anonymous login, and access should be restricted to authenticated users with strong credentials. Furthermore, implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to add an essential layer of security against credential compromise. Finally, establish and enforce a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees to keep them informed about current cyber threats and best security practices, thereby strengthening the human firewall. Consider a hardware refresh for older workstations that cannot support newer operating systems.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security with MFA for email and computer logins, and initial security training for new hires. However, significant vulnerabilities exist, including the use of outdated operating systems on workstations, an insecurely configured FTP server allowing anonymous access, and a critical gap in MFA for sensitive data systems. The absence of annual security awareness training further exposes the organization to evolving human-centric threats. Addressing these high and medium severity risks is crucial for enhancing the overall security posture and reducing the likelihood of a successful cyberattack and potential data breach."
