        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed one active host with an open port 80 (HTTP), indicating a potential web server. A review of organizational data highlights critical security deficiencies: the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer login, and sensitive data systems, and a complete lack of security awareness training for both new and existing employees. While an acceptable use policy is in place, these fundamental gaps significantly increase the organization's attack surface and overall risk posture.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for accessing email, logging into computers, or accessing sensitive data systems. This critical vulnerability means that if an attacker obtains a user's credentials (e.g., through phishing or credential stuffing), they can gain unauthorized access to vital organizational resources without an additional layer of verification. This significantly increases the risk of account takeover, data breaches, and lateral movement within the network.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email systems</li><li>User accounts</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Internal network access</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or annually for all employees. This leaves the workforce vulnerable to social engineering attacks such as phishing, malware, and other cyber threats. Employees who are not regularly trained on security best practices are more likely to fall victim to these attacks, potentially leading to system compromise, data loss, or the introduction of malicious software into the network.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li><li>User endpoints</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open Port 80 (HTTP) with Potential Unencrypted Traffic - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A network scan identified an open port 80, indicating that a web server is running and potentially serving unencrypted HTTP traffic. Transmitting data over HTTP leaves it vulnerable to eavesdropping and interception by attackers, who could capture sensitive information. Furthermore, any web application hosted on this port could be susceptible to common web vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQL Injection) if not properly secured, leading to data breaches or system compromise.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Target Host (IP not provided)</li><li>Web server</li><li>Web application (if present)</li><li>Network traffic</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance its security posture, the organization must immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. Concurrently, a comprehensive and mandatory security awareness training program should be established for all new hires and conducted annually for all existing employees to educate them on current cyber threats and best practices. Furthermore, the web service operating on port 80 should be migrated to HTTPS (port 443) to ensure all web traffic is encrypted, and a thorough security audit of the web application should be performed to identify and remediate any existing vulnerabilities.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to a lack of foundational security controls, specifically the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication and a robust security awareness training program. The presence of an open HTTP port further exposes the organization to potential data interception and web application vulnerabilities. While an acceptable use policy is a positive step, these critical gaps indicate a low level of readiness against modern cyber threats. Immediate action on the recommended mitigations is crucial to protect organizational assets and data.</p>
