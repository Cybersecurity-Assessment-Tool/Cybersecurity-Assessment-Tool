        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open SSH port (22), which, while a standard service, represents a potential attack surface if not properly secured. More significantly, the organizational data indicates several critical gaps in foundational security controls. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for email access or computer logins, leaving these critical entry points vulnerable to credential-based attacks. Furthermore, the absence of an employee acceptable use policy and a lack of immediate security awareness training for new employees expose the organization to risks stemming from uncontrolled user behavior and an uninformed workforce. While annual security training is conducted, the initial onboarding period for new hires remains a significant vulnerability.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unprotected Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Email accounts are a primary target for phishing and credential stuffing attacks. Without Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), compromised credentials can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive communications, data, and potentially other connected systems. This significantly increases the risk of data breaches and business email compromise (BEC). This vulnerability was identified by the organization's stated lack of MFA for email access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email accounts</li><li>User credentials</li><li>Organizational data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unprotected Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Without MFA for computer logins, a single compromised password can grant an attacker access to an employee's workstation, potentially leading to lateral movement within the network, data exfiltration, and malware deployment. This poses a significant risk to endpoint security and overall network integrity. This vulnerability was identified by the organization's stated lack of MFA for computer logins.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network access</li><li>Sensitive data on endpoints</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The lack of an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) means there are no formal guidelines for employees regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, internet, and email. This can lead to risky behaviors, such as visiting malicious websites, downloading unauthorized software, or mishandling sensitive data, increasing the likelihood of security incidents and legal liabilities. This vulnerability was identified by the organization's stated lack of an employee acceptable use policy.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All IT resources</li><li>Employee conduct</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Legal compliance</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees are often targets for social engineering attacks as they may not be familiar with organizational security protocols and common threats. The absence of immediate security awareness training upon onboarding leaves them vulnerable to phishing, malware, and other attacks, potentially exposing the organization to initial compromise. This vulnerability was identified by the organization's stated lack of security awareness training for new employees.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network security</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port - <span class="severity-Info">Info</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH (Secure Shell) port (22) was detected on a host. While SSH is a secure protocol for remote access, an open port represents a potential attack surface if not properly secured with strong authentication (e.g., key-based authentication, MFA) and restricted access. Brute-force attacks are common against open SSH ports. This was identified via the network scan data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Server with open port 22</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and computer logins. A comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) should be developed, communicated, and enforced across the entire workforce. Furthermore, mandatory security awareness training must be introduced for all new employees as part of their onboarding process to ensure they are equipped with essential security knowledge from day one. For the open SSH port, review and harden its configuration by implementing strong authentication methods (e.g., key-based authentication), disabling password authentication where possible, and restricting access to trusted IP addresses only.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to the absence of fundamental security controls, particularly regarding Multi-Factor Authentication for critical access points and comprehensive employee policies and training. While the network scan did not reveal critical technical vulnerabilities beyond an open SSH port requiring hardening, the organizational gaps present a high likelihood of successful cyberattacks through social engineering or credential compromise. Addressing these foundational weaknesses is paramount to enhancing the organization's overall security posture and readiness against prevalent cyber threats.</p>
