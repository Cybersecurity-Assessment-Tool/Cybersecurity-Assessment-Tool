        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Based on the provided data, the organization's network has an open port 80, indicating a potential web server or service exposed to the internet, which could be a vector for attack if not properly secured. Internally, the organization has some security controls in place, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) for computer logins and sensitive data systems, and conducts annual security awareness training for all employees. However, critical gaps exist, including the absence of MFA for email access, a lack of an employee acceptable use policy, and no security awareness training specifically for new employees. These deficiencies suggest a mixed state of security readiness, with some foundational controls present but significant vulnerabilities in key areas like email security and initial employee onboarding.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unencrypted Web Service Exposure - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open port 80 (HTTP) was identified on a host within the network. This typically indicates a web server or service running without encryption (HTTPS). Unencrypted communication can allow attackers to intercept sensitive data, session cookies, or credentials in transit. It also exposes the underlying web server to potential vulnerabilities if not regularly patched and configured securely.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with open port 80</li><li>Web server/service on port 80</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Email Account Compromise Risk - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of email account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. A compromised email account can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, or further lateral movement within the network.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee email accounts</li><li>Email server/service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Uncontrolled Employee Behavior - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without a clear AUP, employees may not understand their responsibilities regarding company assets, data handling, and internet usage, leading to increased risks such as data leakage, malware infections, or non-compliance with regulations. This absence creates a gap in governance and can hinder incident response efforts.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Untrained New Employee Vulnerability - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training upon joining the organization. This leaves them vulnerable to common social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) and unaware of organizational security best practices from the outset. Untrained new hires can inadvertently introduce malware, fall victim to scams, or mishandle sensitive information, posing an immediate risk to the organization's security posture.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, the organization should prioritize several key actions. Firstly, implement MFA for all email access immediately to significantly reduce the risk of account compromise. Secondly, address the open port 80 by either closing it if not needed, or, if it hosts a web service, ensure it is secured with HTTPS encryption, regularly patched, and configured with security best practices. Thirdly, develop and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy, ensuring all employees acknowledge and adhere to it. Finally, establish mandatory security awareness training for all new employees as part of their onboarding process, covering essential topics like phishing recognition, password hygiene, and data handling, to build a strong security culture from day one. Regular reviews of these policies and controls are also recommended.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization exhibits a mixed security posture, with some foundational controls like MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, and annual security awareness training. However, critical vulnerabilities exist, particularly the absence of MFA for email, an open unencrypted web port, and significant gaps in employee governance and initial security training. Addressing these high and medium severity risks is crucial to enhance the overall security readiness, protect against common attack vectors, and foster a more secure operational environment. Proactive implementation of the recommended mitigations will significantly strengthen the organization's defense against cyber threats.</p>
