        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes a MySQL database (version 5.7.33) on port 3306. While the organization has a strong foundation in security awareness training for all employees and an acceptable use policy, there are significant gaps in multi-factor authentication (MFA) implementation. MFA is required for email access but is not enforced for computer logins or access to sensitive data systems.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network, exposing a MySQL database (version 5.7.33). This allows potential attackers to attempt to connect to the database, which could lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or denial of service if vulnerabilities are exploited or weak credentials are used. This was identified via network scanning.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted IP addresses or internal networks. For long-term security, consider implementing a Virtual Private Network (VPN) for all remote database access. Furthermore, the organization should prioritize the implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and access to sensitive data systems to significantly enhance authentication security and prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates good practices in security awareness training and policy enforcement. However, the open MySQL port 3306 presents a critical external attack surface, and the absence of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems leaves significant vulnerabilities that could be exploited. Addressing these issues is crucial for improving the overall security posture and readiness against cyber threats.</p>
