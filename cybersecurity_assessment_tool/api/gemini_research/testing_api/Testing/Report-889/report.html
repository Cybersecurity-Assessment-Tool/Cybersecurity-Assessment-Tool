        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes an Nginx web server (version 1.18.0) on port 443 (HTTPS). While the organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, it lacks MFA for sensitive data systems. Furthermore, there is no established employee acceptable use policy. Security awareness training is conducted for new employees and annually for all staff, which is a positive aspect of their security posture.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Nginx Web Server - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nginx web server running on port 443 is identified as version 1.18.0. This version was released in April 2020 and is significantly outdated, no longer receiving active security updates or bug fixes. Running an End-of-Life (EOL) or substantially older software version exposes the organization to known vulnerabilities (CVEs) that have been patched in newer releases. This could lead to various security incidents, including remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure. The vulnerability was identified through an Nmap scan.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Nginx web server (version 1.18.0) on port 443</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Despite having MFA for email and computer logins, the organization does not require MFA to access sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information. If an attacker compromises a user's credentials for a sensitive data system, they can gain full access without needing a second authentication factor, potentially leading to severe data breaches, data manipulation, or system compromise. This was identified from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All systems classified as sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks an employee acceptable use policy (AUP). Without a formal AUP, employees may not have clear guidelines regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, internet access, email, and data handling. This can lead to unintentional security breaches, increased legal liabilities, and reduced productivity. Employees might engage in risky behaviors such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive information due to a lack of explicit rules. This was identified from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational IT resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately upgrade the Nginx web server to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities and ensure ongoing security support. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to add an essential layer of security against credential compromise. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy (AUP) to clearly define expectations for IT resource usage and data handling, ensuring all employees are trained on its contents. Continue with regular security awareness training for all employees to reinforce best practices and educate them on emerging threats.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security through its existing MFA implementations for email and computer logins, and its consistent security awareness training program. However, critical vulnerabilities exist with the outdated Nginx web server and the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems, posing significant risks to data integrity and confidentiality. The lack of an acceptable use policy also introduces potential compliance and operational risks. Addressing these key areas will substantially enhance the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and readiness against potential threats.</p>
