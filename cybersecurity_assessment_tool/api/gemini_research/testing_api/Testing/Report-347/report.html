        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to access control by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. However, a significant gap exists in foundational security practices, as evidenced by the absence of an employee acceptable use policy and any form of security awareness training for both new and existing employees. A network scan also identified an open SSH port (22) on at least one host, and a critical 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability was noted.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The system identified a critical vulnerability where a service typically intended for local access is exposed externally. This could allow unauthorized access or provide an attacker with a foothold into the internal network, potentially leading to data breaches or system compromise. The specific affected element is an IP address, indicating external exposure.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) for employees. An AUP defines the proper use of organizational assets, systems, and data, setting clear expectations for employee behavior. Without an AUP, there is an increased risk of misuse of company resources, data leakage, and non-compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, as employees may not be aware of their responsibilities or prohibited actions. This was identified by reviewing organizational policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Organizational Policy</li><li>Employee Conduct</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient New Employee Security Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees are not receiving security awareness training upon joining the organization. This leaves them vulnerable to common cyber threats such as phishing, social engineering, and malware, as they may not be equipped with the knowledge to identify and respond to these risks. Untrained new hires can inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities into the network or compromise sensitive data, increasing the overall attack surface. This was identified by reviewing HR and training protocols.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New Employee Onboarding Process</li><li>Human Factor</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Ongoing Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. Regular training is crucial to keep employees updated on evolving cyber threats, reinforce best practices, and maintain a strong security culture. Without ongoing training, employees' security knowledge can degrade over time, making them more susceptible to sophisticated attacks and increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents. This was identified by reviewing organizational training schedules.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All Employees</li><li>Security Culture</li><li>Human Factor</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An Nmap scan identified an open SSH port (22) on a host within the network. While SSH is a legitimate service, an open port represents a potential entry point for attackers if not properly secured with strong authentication, up-to-date software, and restricted access controls. This could lead to unauthorized remote access, brute-force attacks, or exploitation of SSH vulnerabilities.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host IP</li><li>Port 22 (SSH)</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediately investigate and remediate the 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability by identifying the exposed service and implementing strict network segmentation and access controls to limit its accessibility. Develop and implement a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy, ensuring all employees acknowledge and understand its terms. Establish mandatory security awareness training for all new employees during onboarding and implement annual security awareness training for all staff, covering current threats like phishing, social engineering, and data handling best practices. For the open SSH port, review its necessity; if required, ensure it is secured with strong, multi-factor authentication, uses key-based authentication where possible, is patched to the latest version, and access is restricted to a minimal set of trusted IP addresses via firewall rules. Consider changing the default SSH port to further reduce exposure.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has a commendable foundation with MFA for critical systems, its overall cybersecurity readiness is significantly compromised by critical vulnerabilities and substantial gaps in foundational security policies and employee training. The identified 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability and open SSH port present direct technical risks, while the absence of an AUP and comprehensive security awareness training introduces considerable human and operational risks. Addressing these policy and training deficiencies is paramount to building a robust and resilient security posture.</p>
