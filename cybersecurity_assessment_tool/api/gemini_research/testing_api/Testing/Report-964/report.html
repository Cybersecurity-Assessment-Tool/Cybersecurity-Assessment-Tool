        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed no immediately open or vulnerable ports, indicating a basic level of external network hygiene. However, the internal security posture, as indicated by organizational data, shows significant gaps in foundational security controls. Specifically, there is a pervasive lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across critical access points, and essential security policies and ongoing training are either absent or insufficient. While new employees receive security awareness training, there is no annual training for all employees, leaving the workforce potentially vulnerable to evolving threats. The absence of an acceptable use policy further exacerbates the risk of internal misuse or accidental data exposure.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email, logging into computers, or accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access in the event of credential compromise (e.g., phishing, brute-force attacks). Without MFA, a single stolen password can grant an attacker full access to critical organizational resources, leading to data breaches, system compromise, and financial loss. This vulnerability was identified through direct inquiry about MFA implementation.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email systems</li><li>User login systems</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>All employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. This absence means there are no clear guidelines for employees regarding the appropriate use of company assets, data, and network resources. Without such a policy, employees may inadvertently or intentionally engage in activities that pose security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive information. This increases the likelihood of security incidents, data leakage, and compliance violations. This vulnerability was identified through direct inquiry about organizational policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT assets</li><li>Network infrastructure</li><li>Sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This oversight means that employees may not be regularly updated on new and evolving cyber threats, best practices for data protection, and the organization's security policies. Over time, the effectiveness of initial training diminishes, making employees more susceptible to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, vishing), malware, and other human-factor vulnerabilities. This increases the overall risk of security breaches originating from human error. This vulnerability was identified through direct inquiry about security awareness training frequency.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network access</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, the organization should prioritize the immediate implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. This is a foundational security control that significantly reduces the impact of compromised credentials. Concurrently, a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy must be developed, communicated, and enforced to establish clear guidelines for employee conduct regarding IT assets and data. Furthermore, the organization should establish a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees to ensure continuous education on evolving threats and best practices, reinforcing a strong security culture. Regular policy reviews and updates are also crucial to adapt to the changing threat landscape.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to a lack of fundamental security controls, particularly the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication across critical systems and insufficient security policies and training. While the external network scan showed no immediate vulnerabilities, the internal posture indicates a low state of readiness against common and impactful cyber threats. Addressing these foundational gaps is paramount to improving the organization's overall security posture and resilience against potential cyberattacks.</p>
