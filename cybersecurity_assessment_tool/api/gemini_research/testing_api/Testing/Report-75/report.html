        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes a MySQL database (version 5.7.33) via an open port 3306. A significant gap in identity and access management is identified by the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. While an acceptable use policy is in place and new employees receive security awareness training, there is no annual security awareness training for all employees, indicating a potential for human-factor vulnerabilities to grow over time.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network, running version 5.7.33. This direct exposure significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and potential denial-of-service attacks if the database is not adequately secured. This vulnerability was identified through an Nmap scan showing the open port and service.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li><li>MySQL Server 5.7.33</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email, logging into computers, or accessing sensitive data systems. This critical security gap leaves the organization highly vulnerable to credential stuffing, phishing attacks, and brute-force attempts, as a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to critical resources and sensitive information.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email access</li><li>Computer logins</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This oversight means that employees may not be updated on the latest cyber threats, social engineering tactics, and best practices, increasing the likelihood of successful phishing attacks, malware infections, and human error leading to security incidents.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted internal IP addresses or specific application servers. For remote access, a Virtual Private Network (VPN) should be mandated. Crucially, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be deployed across all critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, to significantly enhance identity and access management. Furthermore, a comprehensive and mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees should be established to educate staff on evolving threats and reinforce secure practices. Regular patching and updates for all software, especially the MySQL server, are also essential.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The current cybersecurity posture of the organization presents several critical vulnerabilities, primarily stemming from an exposed database service and a widespread lack of Multi-Factor Authentication across key access points. These issues, combined with insufficient ongoing security awareness training, significantly elevate the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and operational disruption. Immediate and decisive action is required to address these fundamental security weaknesses and enhance the overall readiness against cyber threats.</p>
