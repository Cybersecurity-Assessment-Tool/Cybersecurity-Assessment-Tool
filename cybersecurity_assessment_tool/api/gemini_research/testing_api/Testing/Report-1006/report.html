        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing MFA for email and sensitive data systems, and maintaining an acceptable use policy. However, there are notable gaps in endpoint security and initial employee onboarding security practices, specifically concerning computer login authentication and new employee security awareness training.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Endpoint Authentication - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to internal systems if credentials are compromised through phishing, malware, or brute-force attacks. Without a second factor, a stolen username and password are often sufficient for an attacker to gain access, leading to potential data breaches, system compromise, and lateral movement within the network. This was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers/endpoints</li><li>Internal network access</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Untrained New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While the organization conducts annual security awareness training for all employees, new hires do not receive specific security awareness training upon joining. This leaves a critical window during which new employees may be unaware of common cybersecurity threats (e.g., phishing, social engineering, malware) and organizational security policies. Untrained new employees are more susceptible to falling victim to attacks, potentially introducing vulnerabilities into the organization's environment and compromising sensitive information. This was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network security</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins. This critical measure will significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access to endpoints and the internal network, even if primary credentials are compromised. Additionally, a comprehensive security awareness training program should be established for all new employees as part of their onboarding process. This initial training will ensure that new hires are immediately aware of cybersecurity best practices, common threats, and organizational policies, thereby reducing the human element risk from day one. Regular, engaging training should continue annually for all staff.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization has established a baseline of security controls, including MFA for critical systems and an acceptable use policy. However, the absence of MFA for computer logins and a dedicated security awareness training program for new employees represent significant vulnerabilities. Addressing these gaps is crucial for strengthening the overall security posture, mitigating the risk of unauthorized access, and fostering a more security-conscious workforce from the outset. Proactive implementation of the recommended controls will significantly improve the organization's readiness against evolving cyber threats.</p>
