            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network currently exposes a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) service on port 3389 to the internet, posing a critical security risk. While the organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and conducts regular security awareness training for all employees, significant gaps remain. Specifically, MFA is not required for accessing email or sensitive data systems, and there is no formal employee acceptable use policy in place. These deficiencies indicate a need for immediate attention to strengthen the overall security posture.",

                        "Overview": "Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed to the internet via an open port (3389). This allows potential attackers to attempt brute-force attacks or exploit vulnerabilities in the RDP service, leading to unauthorized access to internal systems. This was identified through a network scan showing port 3389 as open.",

                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Email Access",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing or credential stuffing attacks, as a stolen password alone would grant an attacker full access to an employee's email. This was identified through organizational policy review.",

                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems",
                        "Overview": "Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if a single set of credentials is compromised, potentially leading to data breaches and compliance violations. This was identified through organizational policy review.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy",
                        "Overview": "The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines, employees may engage in activities that inadvertently introduce security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling company data. This increases the overall attack surface and makes it harder to enforce security best practices. This was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Organizational security posture",

                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is critically important to immediately close the exposed RDP port (3389) to the internet. For necessary remote access, implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution that requires strong authentication, ideally with MFA. Furthermore, implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and sensitive data systems to significantly reduce the risk of credential compromise. Develop and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to establish clear guidelines for secure behavior and data handling. While security awareness training is in place, reinforce the importance of these new policies and the risks associated with their absence.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces critical and high-severity vulnerabilities, primarily due to an exposed RDP service and a lack of MFA for email and sensitive data systems. The absence of an acceptable use policy further broadens the attack surface. While the organization demonstrates good practices in MFA for computer logins and regular security awareness training, these critical gaps significantly undermine its overall cybersecurity readiness, leaving it susceptible to unauthorized access, data breaches, and operational disruption."
