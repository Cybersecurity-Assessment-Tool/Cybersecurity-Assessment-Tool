        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open port 8080, initially flagged as 'TOP SECRET DB', however, this has been confirmed as a false positive and is considered secure. While the organization has an acceptable use policy, conducts annual security awareness training for all employees, and requires MFA for sensitive data systems, significant gaps exist in foundational security controls. Specifically, there is no mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access or computer logins, and new employees do not receive initial security awareness training.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing employee email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access through credential theft, phishing, or brute-force attacks. A compromised email account can serve as a gateway for further internal system breaches, data exfiltration, and business email compromise (BEC) scams. This vulnerability was identified through the provided organizational security posture data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee email accounts</li><li>Email servers</li><li>Organizational communication channels</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or guessed. A compromised computer can provide an attacker with access to internal networks, sensitive data, and the ability to deploy malware or ransomware, leading to significant operational disruption and data loss. This vulnerability was identified through the provided organizational security posture data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Servers</li><li>Network access points</li><li>Internal systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct dedicated security awareness training for new employees as part of their onboarding process. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) due to their unfamiliarity with organizational security policies, common threats, and internal procedures. This lack of initial training exposes the organization to increased risk from human error and targeted attacks during a critical onboarding period. This vulnerability was identified through the provided organizational security posture data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network security</li><li>Overall security culture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and computer logins across the entire organization. This should be prioritized to mitigate the high risks associated with credential compromise. Furthermore, a comprehensive security awareness training program must be established for all new employees as part of their onboarding process. This training should cover common threats such as phishing and social engineering, password best practices, and the organization's acceptable use policy. Regular review and updates of existing security policies and training materials are also advised to ensure ongoing relevance to the evolving threat landscape.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently exhibits a mixed state of cybersecurity readiness. While some positive security practices are in place, such as an acceptable use policy, annual security awareness training for existing staff, and MFA for sensitive data systems, critical vulnerabilities persist. The absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for email and computer logins presents a high risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Additionally, the lack of initial security awareness training for new employees creates an avoidable vulnerability window. Addressing these fundamental gaps, particularly the widespread implementation of MFA and robust onboarding security training, is paramount to strengthening the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and resilience against modern cyber threats.</p>
