            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to multi-factor authentication across critical access points including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. Regular security awareness training is also in place for both new and existing employees. However, a critical vulnerability was identified with an open MySQL port (3306) on the network. Additionally, the absence of an employee acceptable use policy represents a gap in governance.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Database Exposure",
                        "Overview": "MySQL port 3306 is open to the network. This exposes the database service to potential unauthorized access and exploitation, which could lead to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service. This was identified through network scanning revealing an open port 3306.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Port 3306 (MySQL)"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "It is strongly recommended to immediately implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted internal IP addresses or specific application servers. For a long-term solution, consider placing the database behind a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or implementing a more robust network segmentation strategy to further isolate sensitive data. Furthermore, the organization should develop and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to clearly define expectations for technology usage, data handling, and security best practices, ensuring all employees are aware of their responsibilities.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization exhibits a commendable security posture regarding multi-factor authentication and security awareness training. However, the presence of an openly accessible MySQL port poses a critical risk, potentially exposing sensitive data to unauthorized access. The absence of an employee acceptable use policy also indicates a gap in governance. Addressing these vulnerabilities, particularly the database exposure, is paramount to enhancing the overall security readiness and protecting organizational assets."
