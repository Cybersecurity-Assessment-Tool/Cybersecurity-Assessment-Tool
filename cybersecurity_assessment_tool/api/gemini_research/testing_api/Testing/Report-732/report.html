        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a proactive stance in several key areas of cybersecurity, notably through the consistent implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the commitment to security awareness training for both new and existing employees on an annual basis is a strong positive. However, due to broken network scan data, a comprehensive technical overview of the network infrastructure and its specific vulnerabilities cannot be provided at this time. The assessment relies primarily on organizational policy and practice data.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). An AUP is crucial for setting clear expectations regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, data, and internet access. Without such a policy, employees may inadvertently or intentionally engage in activities that pose security risks, lead to data breaches, introduce malware, or violate compliance regulations. This absence creates ambiguity regarding employee responsibilities and the consequences of misuse, increasing the organization's exposure to various operational and security threats. This vulnerability was identified directly from the provided organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>IT systems and infrastructure</li><li>Compliance posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>It is strongly recommended that the organization prioritize the development and implementation of a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). This policy should clearly define acceptable and unacceptable uses of company IT resources, data handling procedures, internet usage guidelines, and the consequences of non-compliance. Once developed, the AUP must be formally communicated to all employees, and regular training sessions should be conducted to ensure understanding and adherence. Furthermore, given the broken network scan data, it is critical to conduct a thorough network vulnerability assessment and penetration test to identify and address any technical weaknesses that may exist within the infrastructure. This will provide a complete picture of the organization's security posture and allow for targeted remediation efforts.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization has established a commendable baseline for security through its widespread use of MFA and regular security awareness training. These measures significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and improve employee vigilance. However, the absence of a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy represents a notable gap in the overall security framework, potentially exposing the organization to human-factor risks and compliance challenges. A comprehensive technical assessment is also essential to fully understand and mitigate potential network-level vulnerabilities. Addressing these areas will further strengthen the organization's resilience against cyber threats and enhance its overall security readiness.</p>
