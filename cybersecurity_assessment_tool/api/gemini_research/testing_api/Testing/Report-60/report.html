        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Based on the provided organizational data, the organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems, which is a positive security measure. However, there are significant gaps in endpoint security, policy enforcement, and employee security awareness training. The lack of MFA for computer logins, an acceptable use policy, and regular security awareness training for all employees indicates a lower security readiness posture in these critical areas.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to internal systems if credentials are stolen or compromised through phishing, malware, or brute-force attacks. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's workstation and potentially the internal network.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers</li><li>Internal network</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This means there are no formal guidelines or rules for how employees should use company IT resources, including computers, networks, and data. This absence can lead to misuse of company assets, increased exposure to malware, data breaches, and legal liabilities, as employees may unknowingly engage in risky behaviors without clear boundaries.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Data integrity</li><li>Legal compliance</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) as they may be less familiar with company security protocols and common threats. Without initial training, new employees are more likely to fall victim to such attacks, potentially introducing malware, compromising credentials, or facilitating unauthorized access to the organization's systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Company network</li><li>Data</li><li>Email systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Infrequent Security Awareness Training for All Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. Cybersecurity threats constantly evolve, and without regular, updated training, employees' knowledge of best practices and emerging threats can become outdated. This increases the overall susceptibility of the organization to various attacks, including phishing, social engineering, and malware, as employees may not recognize or properly respond to current threats.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company network</li><li>Data</li><li>Email systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to prevent unauthorized access from compromised credentials. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to establish clear guidelines for IT resource usage, thereby reducing misuse and potential security incidents. Furthermore, establish a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees upon onboarding and conduct annual refresher training for all staff. These training programs should cover topics such as phishing recognition, password hygiene, data handling best practices, and incident reporting procedures to cultivate a strong security culture and empower employees to be the first line of defense.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has taken positive steps by implementing MFA for email and sensitive data systems, its overall cybersecurity readiness is significantly hampered by critical gaps in endpoint security, policy enforcement, and employee education. The absence of MFA for computer logins, a formal acceptable use policy, and consistent security awareness training for both new and existing employees exposes the organization to a high risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and operational disruptions. Addressing these vulnerabilities through the recommended measures is crucial for building a robust defense against evolving cyber threats and fostering a more secure operational environment.</p>
