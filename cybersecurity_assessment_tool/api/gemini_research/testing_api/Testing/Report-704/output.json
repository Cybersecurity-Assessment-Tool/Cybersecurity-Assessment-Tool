                "Summary": "The organization's network scan revealed an open port 80, indicating a potential web server or service accessible over unencrypted HTTP. While security awareness training is conducted for all employees, critical gaps exist in access control, specifically the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the absence of an employee acceptable use policy suggests a need for clearer guidelines regarding appropriate technology usage.",

                        "Risk": "Unencrypted Web Service",
                        "Overview": "An open port 80 was identified, indicating a service potentially running over unencrypted HTTP. This exposes data transmitted to and from the service to eavesdropping and interception, making it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. This was identified via an Nmap scan.",

                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of email account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing, potentially leading to business email compromise (BEC) and data exfiltration. This was identified through organizational policy review.",

                        "Overview": "Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk, as compromised credentials could grant attackers direct access to confidential information, leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and severe reputational damage. This was identified through organizational policy review.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Employee Misconduct & Policy Gaps",
                        "Overview": "The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines on appropriate use of company IT resources, employees may inadvertently or intentionally engage in activities that introduce security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive information. This was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employee workstations",
                            "Network resources",
                            "Data handling procedures"

                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement HTTPS for all web services, ensuring that traffic over port 80 is either redirected or secured with encryption. Immediately enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and, most critically, for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access even if primary credentials are compromised. Furthermore, develop and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy, ensuring all employees are trained on its contents and understand their responsibilities regarding secure IT practices. Regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing should also be conducted to identify and address further potential weaknesses.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security awareness training; however, significant vulnerabilities exist in its access control mechanisms and policy framework. The absence of MFA for email and sensitive data systems, coupled with an open unencrypted web service and the lack of an acceptable use policy, creates a substantial attack surface. Addressing these critical and high-severity risks is paramount to enhancing the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and readiness against evolving threats."
