            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to foundational security practices, including multi-factor authentication for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, as well as having an employee acceptable use policy and security awareness training for new employees. However, a critical vulnerability was identified: an open RDP port (3389) on a network host, which poses a significant risk for unauthorized access. Additionally, the organization currently lacks annual security awareness training for all employees, which is a key area for improvement in maintaining a robust security posture.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "RDP Exposure",
                        "Overview": "Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) port 3389 was found to be open on a network host. This exposure allows potential attackers to attempt brute-force attacks or exploit RDP vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to internal systems. The impact could range from data exfiltration to full system compromise. This was identified through network scanning.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "IP"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately close port 3389 (RDP) on the affected host if it is not absolutely essential for business operations. For necessary remote access, implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution to secure RDP connections, ensuring that access is authenticated and encrypted. Furthermore, to address the gap in security awareness, the organization should establish and enforce a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees. This will help reinforce best practices, educate staff on emerging threats, and reduce the likelihood of human-factor related security incidents.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization has a solid foundation with MFA implementation and initial security training. However, the presence of an exposed RDP port represents a critical vulnerability that requires immediate attention. The lack of annual security awareness training for all employees also indicates a potential weakness in maintaining a consistently secure environment. Addressing these two key areas will significantly enhance the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and reduce its attack surface."
