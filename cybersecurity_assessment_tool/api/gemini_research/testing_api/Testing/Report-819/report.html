        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently has an open MySQL database (version 5.7.33) accessible on port 3306. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required for computer logins, it is not enforced for email access or sensitive data systems. The organization has an acceptable use policy and conducts annual security awareness training for all employees, but new employees do not receive initial security awareness training upon onboarding.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network, exposing the database service (MySQL version 5.7.33). This direct exposure increases the risk of unauthorized access, brute-force attacks, or exploitation of known vulnerabilities in the MySQL version, potentially leading to data breaches or service disruption. The vulnerability was identified via network scanning.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts if credentials are compromised through phishing or other means, potentially leading to business email compromise, data exfiltration, or further internal network penetration. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not enforced for accessing sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if a single factor (e.g., password) is compromised, increasing the risk of data breaches, compliance violations, and reputational damage. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training upon onboarding. This means new hires may not be immediately aware of organizational security policies, common threats like phishing, or best practices, making them more susceptible to social engineering attacks and potentially introducing vulnerabilities from day one. While annual training is conducted, the initial gap for new hires is a significant risk. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, ideally limiting it to only necessary internal IP addresses or a VPN for remote access. Furthermore, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) should be immediately implemented and enforced for all email access and sensitive data systems to significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials. For human-centric risks, a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees should be established as part of the onboarding process, complementing the existing annual training. The organization should continue to leverage its employee acceptable use policy to reinforce security best practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational level of security with MFA for computer logins and annual security awareness training. However, critical vulnerabilities exist, particularly with an exposed MySQL database and the absence of MFA for email and sensitive data systems. The lack of initial security awareness training for new employees also presents a notable risk. Addressing these areas, especially the implementation of MFA and network segmentation for the database, is crucial for enhancing the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and readiness against evolving threats.</p>
