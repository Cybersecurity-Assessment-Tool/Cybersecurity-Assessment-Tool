        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan identified at least one active host with an open SSH (port 22) service. While the target information was not specified in the scan metadata, the presence of an open SSH port indicates a potential entry point that requires careful security management. Beyond network infrastructure, a review of organizational policies revealed significant gaps in critical security controls, particularly concerning Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), employee policies, and ongoing security awareness training.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts through credential stuffing, phishing, or brute-force attacks. A compromised email account can serve as a gateway for business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and further penetration into the organization's systems. This vulnerability was identified through a review of organizational security policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>All employee email accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for logging into organizational computers. This leaves computer systems vulnerable to unauthorized access if user credentials are stolen, guessed, or compromised. Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to internal resources, lateral movement within the network, data theft, and potential system compromise. This vulnerability was identified through a review of organizational security policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All organizational computers</li><li>User login processes</li><li>Internal network resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive data systems. This critical omission exposes high-value assets to a severe risk of unauthorized access. A breach in these systems could result in significant data loss, regulatory non-compliance, substantial financial penalties, severe reputational damage, and operational disruption. This vulnerability was identified through a review of organizational security policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases containing confidential information</li><li>Critical business applications</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks an employee acceptable use policy (AUP). Without clear guidelines, employees may be unaware of their responsibilities and appropriate conduct when using company IT resources. This absence increases the risk of misuse of company assets, accidental data exposure, introduction of malware, and other security incidents stemming from human error or negligence. This vulnerability was identified through a review of organizational policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational IT systems</li><li>Company data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This practice leaves the workforce susceptible to evolving cyber threats, as knowledge can become outdated, and new attack vectors may not be effectively communicated. This increases the organization's overall risk to social engineering attacks, phishing campaigns, and other human-centric vulnerabilities. This vulnerability was identified through a review of organizational training practices.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed SSH Service - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH (port 22) service was detected on an active host within the network. While SSH is a legitimate and necessary service for remote administration, if not properly secured, it can be a target for brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or exploitation of vulnerabilities in the SSH daemon. This could lead to unauthorized remote access to the affected host. This vulnerability was identified via an Nmap network scan.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with open port 22</li><li>SSH service</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, immediate action is required across several key areas. Firstly, implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, including email systems, computer logins, and especially sensitive data systems, to prevent unauthorized access from compromised credentials. Secondly, develop and formally implement a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) to clearly define employee responsibilities and appropriate conduct regarding IT resources. Thirdly, establish and enforce mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees to ensure they are continuously updated on current threats and best practices. Lastly, review and harden the exposed SSH service by implementing strong security configurations such as disabling password authentication in favor of key-based authentication, restricting access to trusted IP addresses, disabling root login, and deploying intrusion prevention systems like fail2ban.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to a lack of fundamental security controls. The absence of Multi-Factor Authentication across critical systems, coupled with the lack of an Acceptable Use Policy and insufficient ongoing security awareness training, creates a highly vulnerable environment. Additionally, an exposed SSH service presents a direct attack vector. Addressing these identified vulnerabilities with the recommended actions is crucial for improving the organization's readiness against cyber threats and protecting its valuable assets from potential breaches.</p>
