        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, and maintains an employee acceptable use policy. New employees receive security awareness training. However, annual security awareness training for all employees is not consistently conducted. Network scans revealed an open FTP service running vsftpd 2.3.4, which is configured to allow anonymous login, posing a significant security risk.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Operating System - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Many workstations are running Windows 7, an operating system that has reached its end-of-life. This exposes the systems to unpatched vulnerabilities, increasing the risk of malware infection, data breaches, and system compromise. This was identified through an internal risk assessment.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Anonymous FTP Access - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The network hosts an FTP server (vsftpd 2.3.4) that allows anonymous login. This configuration can lead to unauthorized access to files, data leakage, or even the upload of malicious content, severely compromising data confidentiality and integrity. This was identified via an Nmap scan with the ftp-anon script.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>FTP Server (vsftpd 2.3.4 on port 21)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This lack of regular reinforcement leaves employees susceptible to evolving social engineering attacks, phishing attempts, and other human-factor vulnerabilities, increasing the risk of security incidents. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All Employees</li><li>Organizational Security Posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to upgrade all Windows 7 workstations to a currently supported operating system like Windows 10 or 11, potentially requiring hardware refitting. The anonymous FTP access on the vsftpd 2.3.4 server must be immediately disabled, and access should be restricted to authenticated users with strong credentials, or the service should be decommissioned if not essential. Furthermore, the organization should implement a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees to ensure continuous education on current threats and best practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security by implementing MFA for critical systems and having an acceptable use policy. However, significant vulnerabilities exist, including the presence of end-of-life operating systems on workstations, a critical anonymous FTP access point, and a gap in annual security awareness training for all employees. Addressing these issues is crucial for enhancing the overall security posture and reducing the attack surface against modern cyber threats.</p>
