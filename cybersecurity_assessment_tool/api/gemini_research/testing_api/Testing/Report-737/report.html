        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) port (3389) on at least one host, indicating a potential external attack surface. Furthermore, the organization currently lacks multi-factor authentication (MFA) for critical access points including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. There is no employee acceptable use policy in place, and security awareness training is not conducted for new employees, although annual training is provided for all staff.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>RDP Exposure - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) port 3389 was found to be openly accessible during the network scan. This exposure allows potential attackers to attempt brute-force attacks or exploit known vulnerabilities in the RDP service, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data compromise, or system control. The impact could be severe, including complete system takeover and lateral movement within the network.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>System(s) with open RDP port 3389</li><li>ms-wbt-server service</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately close the exposed RDP port 3389 to external access. For legitimate remote access needs, implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution to secure connections. Furthermore, the organization should prioritize the implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts, computer logins, and access to sensitive data systems to significantly enhance access control. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to define expected behavior and security responsibilities. Finally, introduce mandatory security awareness training for all new employees to ensure a baseline understanding of cybersecurity best practices from day one, complementing the existing annual training program.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The current cybersecurity posture of the organization presents several critical vulnerabilities, primarily highlighted by the exposed RDP service and a significant lack of foundational security controls such as Multi-Factor Authentication across key access points. While annual security awareness training is a positive step, the absence of an acceptable use policy and new employee training leaves considerable gaps. Addressing these issues, particularly the critical RDP exposure and MFA implementation, is paramount to improving the organization's overall security readiness and reducing its attack surface.</p>
