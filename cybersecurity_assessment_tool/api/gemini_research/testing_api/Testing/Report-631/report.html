        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, and maintaining an employee acceptable use policy. New employees also receive security awareness training. However, the assessment identified critical gaps, including the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems and a lack of recurring annual security awareness training for all employees. Furthermore, a network scan revealed an open SSH port (22) on a host, presenting a potential entry point for attackers if not adequately secured.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Multi-Factor Authentication for Sensitive Data - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or other means. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to sensitive data, leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and reputational damage. This was identified from the organizational data indicating 'Do you require MFA to access sensitive data systems?':'No'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Infrequent Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. While new employees receive training, the lack of regular, recurring training means that employees may forget best practices, fail to stay updated on new threats (e.g., evolving phishing techniques, social engineering), and become less vigilant over time. This increases the overall human risk factor, making the organization more susceptible to social engineering attacks, malware infections, and policy violations. This was identified from the organizational data indicating 'Does your organization do security awareness training for all employees at least once per year?':'No'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port Exposure - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An Nmap scan identified an open SSH (Secure Shell) port (22) on a host within the network. While SSH is a legitimate service for remote administration, an open port represents an attack surface. If not properly secured with strong authentication (e.g., key-based authentication, MFA), rate limiting, and restricted access (e.g., firewall rules), it can be vulnerable to brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or exploitation of SSH daemon vulnerabilities, potentially leading to unauthorized remote access to the system. The scan data showed an open port 22.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host(s) with open port 22</li><li>SSH service</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised. Additionally, a comprehensive and mandatory annual security awareness training program should be established for all employees to ensure continuous education on evolving cyber threats and best practices. For the identified open SSH port, it is crucial to review and harden its configuration by implementing strong authentication methods (e.g., key-based authentication, disabling password authentication), restricting access to trusted IP addresses via firewall rules, and ensuring the SSH daemon is regularly patched and updated. While the existing MFA for email and computer logins, acceptable use policy, and new employee training are positive steps, addressing these critical vulnerabilities will significantly enhance the organization's overall security posture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently exhibits a mixed security posture. While some essential security controls like MFA for email and computer logins are in place, significant vulnerabilities exist concerning sensitive data access, ongoing employee security education, and network service exposure. Addressing the lack of MFA for sensitive data systems, implementing regular security awareness training for all staff, and securing the open SSH port are paramount to reducing the organization's attack surface and improving its readiness against cyber threats. Proactive remediation of these findings will be crucial for protecting critical assets and maintaining a robust security environment.</p>
