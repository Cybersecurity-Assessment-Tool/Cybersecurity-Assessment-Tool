        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes an Nginx web server on port 443, indicating a public-facing HTTPS service. Internally, the organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems, which is a positive security measure. However, critical gaps exist in workstation login security, employee policy enforcement, and ongoing security awareness training, which collectively elevate the overall risk posture.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Authentication Controls for Workstations - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised. Without MFA, a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication, making systems vulnerable to brute-force attacks, phishing, and credential stuffing, potentially leading to lateral movement within the network.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee workstations</li><li>Internal network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). This absence means there are no clear, documented guidelines for employees regarding the proper and secure use of company IT resources, data, and internet access. This can lead to misuse of company assets, increased exposure to malware, data breaches, and non-compliance with industry regulations, as employees may unknowingly engage in risky behaviors.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Data integrity and confidentiality</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Ongoing Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual training for all employees. Cybersecurity threats evolve rapidly, and without regular updates, employees may not be aware of the latest phishing techniques, social engineering tactics, or best practices for data protection. This significantly increases the risk of human error leading to security incidents, such as clicking malicious links, falling for scams, or mishandling sensitive information.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network security</li><li>Incident response preparedness</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to enhance workstation security and prevent unauthorized access. Furthermore, develop and enforce a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) that clearly outlines expectations for secure IT resource usage. Finally, establish a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees to ensure they are continuously updated on evolving cyber threats and best practices, thereby strengthening the human firewall against social engineering and other attacks.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing MFA for sensitive systems and initial employee training. However, the absence of MFA for computer logins, a formal Acceptable Use Policy, and ongoing security awareness training for all employees represent significant vulnerabilities. Addressing these areas is crucial to enhance the overall security posture, reduce the risk of human-factor incidents, and protect against unauthorized access and data breaches.</p>
