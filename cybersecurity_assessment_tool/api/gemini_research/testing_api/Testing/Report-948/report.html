        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security through mandatory MFA for computer logins, a comprehensive acceptable use policy, and regular security awareness training for all employees. However, critical gaps exist in the implementation of multi-factor authentication for email access and sensitive data systems, which significantly elevates the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Email Security - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks. If an attacker gains access to an employee's email, they can use it for further internal phishing, business email compromise (BEC) scams, or to reset passwords for other services, leading to broader network infiltration. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating "Do you require MFA to access email?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>All employee email accounts</li><li>Potentially connected services</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unprotected Sensitive Data Access - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into systems containing sensitive data. This poses a critical risk, as a single compromised password could grant an attacker direct access to confidential information, intellectual property, or customer data. The absence of this crucial security layer makes these systems highly vulnerable to unauthorized access, data exfiltration, and compliance violations. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating "Do you require MFA to access sensitive data systems?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts with access to sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>It is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and for all systems containing sensitive data. This critical security control will significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and account compromise. Furthermore, while existing security awareness training and acceptable use policies are positive, regular reviews and updates should be conducted to ensure they remain effective and address evolving threat landscapes, reinforcing the importance of strong authentication practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently exhibits a mixed security posture. While good practices are in place for computer login MFA, acceptable use policies, and security awareness training, the absence of MFA for email and sensitive data systems represents critical vulnerabilities. Addressing these MFA gaps is paramount to enhancing the organization's overall security readiness and protecting against prevalent cyber threats such as phishing and unauthorized data access.</p>
