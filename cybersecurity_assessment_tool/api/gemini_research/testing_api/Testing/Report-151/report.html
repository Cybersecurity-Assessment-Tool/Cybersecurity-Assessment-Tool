        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins. However, critical gaps exist in securing sensitive data systems, employee policy enforcement, and ongoing security awareness training. Network scanning identified an open SSH port, which, while common, represents a potential attack surface if not adequately secured. The overall security posture indicates a need for immediate attention to these identified vulnerabilities to enhance readiness against common cyber threats.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if credentials are compromised through phishing, malware, or other means. An attacker gaining access to a single set of credentials could potentially access sensitive data without an additional layer of authentication, leading to data breaches and compliance violations.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy. Without an AUP, employees may be unaware of the expected standards for using company IT resources, leading to potential misuse, unauthorized software installations, risky browsing habits, or improper handling of company data. This increases the likelihood of security incidents, data loss, and compliance violations due to inconsistent employee behavior.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee workstations</li><li>Network resources</li><li>Company data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual training for all employees. This means that existing employees may not be updated on the latest threats, best practices, and organizational policies, leading to a degradation of security posture over time. Employees are often the first line of defense against social engineering and phishing attacks, and outdated knowledge increases their susceptibility to such attacks.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port (Port 22) - <span class="severity-Low">Low</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A host on the network has port 22 (SSH) open. While SSH is a legitimate service for remote access, an open SSH port represents an attack surface. If not properly secured with strong authentication (e.g., key-based authentication, MFA), rate limiting, and up-to-date software, it can be vulnerable to brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or exploitation of software vulnerabilities, potentially leading to unauthorized remote access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with open port 22</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access. A comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) should be developed, communicated, and enforced across all employees to establish clear guidelines for IT resource usage. Furthermore, a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees must be established to ensure continuous education on current threats and best practices. Finally, all open SSH ports should be reviewed to ensure they are secured with strong authentication methods, access controls, and are regularly patched and monitored for suspicious activity.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently exhibits a mixed security posture. While some essential security measures like MFA for email and computer logins are in place, significant vulnerabilities exist concerning the protection of sensitive data systems, the absence of a formal acceptable use policy, and the lack of consistent, annual security awareness training for all employees. These gaps collectively increase the organization's exposure to data breaches, operational disruptions, and compliance failures. Addressing these critical areas will substantially improve the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and resilience against evolving threats.</p>
