        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, which represents a strong foundational security control. The external network scan indicated no open ports, suggesting a potentially hardened external perimeter, though the scan data was minimal. Despite these technical strengths, significant gaps exist in foundational security practices related to human factors, specifically the absence of an employee acceptable use policy and a lack of dedicated security awareness training for new employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). An AUP is critical for defining the acceptable and unacceptable use of organizational IT resources, including networks, systems, software, and data. Without clear guidelines, employees may inadvertently or intentionally misuse resources, increasing the risk of security incidents, data breaches, or compliance violations. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational IT resources (networks, systems, data)</li><li>Overall security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate New Employee Security Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While the organization conducts annual security awareness training for all employees, there is no specific security awareness training provided to new employees upon onboarding. New employees are often more susceptible to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) and may not be immediately familiar with the organization's specific security best practices and policies. This oversight increases the risk of human error leading to security incidents during their initial employment period. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Email systems</li><li>Overall security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization develop and implement a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). This policy should clearly outline the permissible use of all IT resources and be formally communicated to all employees, requiring acknowledgment of understanding. Furthermore, a mandatory security awareness training program specifically for new employees should be established as an integral part of the onboarding process. This training should cover common threats such as phishing, social engineering, password hygiene, and the importance of adhering to organizational security policies. Regular review and updates of both the AUP and training materials are also advised to ensure their continued relevance and effectiveness against evolving threats.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a commendable commitment to security through its widespread implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication across critical access points. The initial network scan also suggests a hardened external posture. However, the current security posture is significantly undermined by critical gaps in human-centric security controls. The absence of an Employee Acceptable Use Policy and dedicated security awareness training for new hires introduces considerable risk, as human error and lack of clear guidelines remain primary vectors for security incidents. Addressing these policy and training deficiencies is paramount to achieving a more robust and comprehensive security readiness.</p>
