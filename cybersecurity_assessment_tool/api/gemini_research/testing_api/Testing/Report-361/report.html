        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an Nginx web server version 1.18.0 running on port 443 (HTTPS). Organizational data indicates that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required for email access but not for computer logins or sensitive data systems. An acceptable use policy is in place, and annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees, however, new employees do not receive dedicated security awareness training upon onboarding.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Web Server Software - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nginx web server running on port 443 is identified as version 1.18.0. This version was released in April 2020 and is no longer actively maintained for security updates. Running outdated software exposes the organization to known vulnerabilities that have been patched in newer versions, potentially leading to remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure. This was identified via network scan data showing Nginx 1.18.0 on port 443.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Server running Nginx 1.18.0 on port 443</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Authentication for Computer Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if an employee's credentials (username and password) are compromised through phishing, malware, or brute-force attacks. Without a second factor, a stolen password is often sufficient for an attacker to gain access to internal systems. This was identified from the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers</li><li>Network endpoints</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Authentication for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to compromise if credentials are stolen. Attackers gaining access to these systems could lead to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and significant reputational and financial damage. This was identified from the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate New Employee Security Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While the organization conducts annual security awareness training for all employees, new employees do not receive specific security awareness training upon onboarding. This creates a window of vulnerability where new hires may not be aware of critical security policies, common threat vectors (like phishing), or best practices, making them more susceptible to social engineering attacks and potentially introducing risks to the organization from day one. This was identified from the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to upgrade the Nginx web server to the latest stable version to ensure all known security vulnerabilities are patched. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and access to sensitive data systems to significantly enhance authentication security and prevent unauthorized access from compromised credentials. Furthermore, establish a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees as part of their onboarding process to ensure they are immediately aware of security policies and best practices, thereby reducing the risk of human-factor vulnerabilities.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several significant security risks, including an outdated web server, critical gaps in Multi-Factor Authentication implementation for computer and sensitive data system access, and a lack of initial security awareness training for new employees. While some security measures are in place, these vulnerabilities present considerable exposure to potential data breaches, unauthorized access, and operational disruption. Addressing these issues promptly is crucial to improving the overall security posture and readiness against cyber threats.</p>
