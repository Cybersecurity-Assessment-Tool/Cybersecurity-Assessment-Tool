            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network scan revealed an open RDP port (3389) with the 'ms-wbt-server' service running, indicating potential exposure. While the organization implements MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, it currently lacks MFA for email access and does not have an employee acceptable use policy. Security awareness training is conducted for all employees, including new hires, on an annual basis.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "RDP Exposure",
                        "Overview": "Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed to the internet via an open port (3389). This allows potential attackers to attempt brute-force attacks or exploit RDP vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to internal systems. The impact could range from unauthorized access to data exfiltration or system compromise. This was identified through a network scan showing port 3389 open.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "IP address with open port 3389"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Email",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks. If an attacker gains access to an employee's email, it could lead to further internal network access, business email compromise (BEC) scams, or data breaches. This was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Email system",
                            "Employee accounts"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy",
                        "Overview": "The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. This means there are no clear guidelines for employees regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, internet access, and data handling. This can lead to increased risks such as data leakage, malware infections from unauthorized software installations or website visits, and non-compliance with industry regulations. This was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "Company IT resources",
                            "Data handling procedures"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately close the exposed RDP port (3389) to the internet. For necessary remote access, implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution that requires strong authentication, ideally with MFA, before allowing RDP connections. Furthermore, implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access to significantly reduce the risk of account compromise. Develop and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy that clearly outlines expectations for IT resource usage, data handling, and security best practices. Ensure this policy is communicated to all employees and integrated into annual security awareness training.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces critical and high-severity vulnerabilities, primarily due to an exposed RDP service and the absence of MFA for email access. While strong security awareness training is in place and MFA is used for sensitive systems, the lack of an acceptable use policy further highlights areas for improvement. Addressing these issues promptly is crucial to enhance the overall security posture and reduce the likelihood of a successful cyberattack."
