        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) via an open port (3389), presenting a critical security vulnerability. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is utilized for email access and annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees, there are notable gaps in the security posture. Specifically, MFA is not mandated for computer logins or access to sensitive data systems, and new employees do not receive initial security awareness training. An employee acceptable use policy is in place.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>RDP Exposure - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed to the internet via an open port (3389). This allows external entities to attempt to connect to internal systems, significantly increasing the risk of brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, and unauthorized access. This vulnerability was identified through a network scan revealing an open RDP port.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP address with port 3389 open</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if employee credentials are compromised through phishing, malware, or other means, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers</li><li>Login systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access sensitive data systems. This poses a high risk, as compromised credentials could grant attackers direct access to critical organizational data, leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and significant reputational damage. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>File shares</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training during their onboarding process. This leaves new hires vulnerable to social engineering attacks, phishing, and other common cyber threats from day one, potentially introducing vulnerabilities into the organization's security posture. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Onboarding process</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately close the exposed RDP port (3389) to the internet. For secure remote access, implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) and ensure RDP is only accessible through this secure tunnel. Furthermore, implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and access to sensitive data systems to significantly enhance protection against unauthorized access. Introduce mandatory security awareness training for all new employees as part of their onboarding process to ensure they are equipped with essential cybersecurity knowledge from the start. Regularly review and update the acceptable use policy, ensuring consistent enforcement and employee adherence.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces critical and high-severity security risks, primarily due to an exposed RDP port and the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for computer logins and sensitive data systems. While some foundational security measures are in place, such as MFA for email and annual security awareness training, the identified vulnerabilities significantly compromise the organization's overall security posture and readiness against sophisticated cyber threats. Addressing these critical gaps is paramount to protecting organizational assets and data.</p>
