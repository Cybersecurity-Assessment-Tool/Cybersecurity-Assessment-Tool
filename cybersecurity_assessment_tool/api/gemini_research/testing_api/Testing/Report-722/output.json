            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network infrastructure includes an FTP service running vsftpd 2.3.4. Security policies indicate that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required for email and computer logins, but not for sensitive data systems. An employee acceptable use policy is in place, however, there is no security awareness training for new employees or annual training for all employees. Furthermore, several workstations are identified as running an outdated operating system, Windows 7.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Anonymous FTP Login Allowed",
                        "Overview": "The FTP service (vsftpd 2.3.4) on port 21 is configured to allow anonymous login. This misconfiguration can lead to unauthorized access to files, potential data leakage, or even arbitrary file uploads if not properly secured. This vulnerability was identified via an Nmap scan utilizing the 'ftp-anon' script.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                    {
                        "Risk": "No MFA for Sensitive Data Systems",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information in the event of compromised credentials, making it easier for attackers to breach sensitive data.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or annually for all employees. This leaves employees vulnerable to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, malware) and increases the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents, thereby weakening the overall security posture.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "Organizational security posture"

                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Outdated Operating System",
                        "Overview": "Several computers are running Windows 7, an operating system that has reached its end-of-life and no longer receives security updates from Microsoft. This exposes workstations to known and unpatched vulnerabilities, making them highly susceptible to exploitation by attackers and increasing the risk of malware infection or data compromise.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Workstations running Windows 7"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately disable anonymous FTP access and implement robust authentication and authorization controls for the FTP service, or migrate to a more secure protocol like SFTP/FTPS. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be implemented for all sensitive data systems to provide an additional layer of security against credential compromise. The organization should establish and regularly conduct comprehensive security awareness training for all employees, including new hires, to educate them on common threats and secure practices. Furthermore, all workstations running Windows 7 must be upgraded to a currently supported operating system (e.g., Windows 10 or 11) to ensure they receive critical security updates and patches, potentially requiring a hardware refresh.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization exhibits a mixed security posture with some foundational controls in place, such as MFA for email and computer logins, and an acceptable use policy. However, critical vulnerabilities, including an anonymous FTP server, the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems, a lack of security awareness training, and the use of end-of-life operating systems on workstations, collectively present a significant attack surface. Addressing these high-severity risks is paramount to improving the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and reducing the likelihood of a successful breach."
