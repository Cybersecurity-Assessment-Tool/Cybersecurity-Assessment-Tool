        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently presents several critical security vulnerabilities. A network scan revealed an open Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) port (3389) exposed to the internet, which is a significant entry point for attackers. While the organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and conducts regular security awareness training for all employees, there are notable gaps in their overall security posture. Specifically, MFA is not required for computer logins or access to sensitive data systems, and there is no formal employee acceptable use policy in place. These deficiencies increase the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and overall system compromise.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>RDP Exposure - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed to the internet via an open port (3389). This allows potential attackers to attempt brute-force attacks or exploit vulnerabilities in the RDP service, significantly increasing the risk of unauthorized access to internal systems. This vulnerability was identified through a network scan showing port 3389 in an open state.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP address with open port 3389</li><li>ms-wbt-server service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if employee credentials are stolen or compromised, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication. This vulnerability was identified through a review of organizational security policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers</li><li>User authentication processes</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not enforced for accessing sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access in the event of compromised credentials, potentially leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and significant reputational damage. This vulnerability was identified through a review of organizational security policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines, employees may inadvertently engage in activities that introduce security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling company data. This increases the overall attack surface and makes it challenging to enforce consistent security best practices. This vulnerability was identified through a review of organizational security policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational IT resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, immediate and strategic actions are recommended. For the exposed RDP service, it is critical to immediately close port 3389 to the internet. A more secure long-term solution involves implementing a Virtual Private Network (VPN) for remote access, ensuring all RDP connections are securely tunneled. Furthermore, the organization must implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and access to sensitive data systems to significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials. Developing and enforcing a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy is crucial to establish clear guidelines for employee conduct, minimize human error, and strengthen the overall security posture. Regular review and updates of these policies, alongside continued security awareness training, will foster a more secure environment.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces critical security risks, primarily stemming from an exposed RDP service and significant gaps in authentication controls, specifically the lack of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems. The absence of an acceptable use policy further exacerbates these risks by leaving user behavior unchecked. While the organization demonstrates a commitment to security awareness training and MFA for email, these efforts are undermined by the identified critical vulnerabilities. Addressing these issues promptly is essential to enhance the organization's readiness against cyber threats and protect its assets effectively.</p>
