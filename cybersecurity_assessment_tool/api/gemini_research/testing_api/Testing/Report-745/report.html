        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to multi-factor authentication (MFA), requiring it for email, computer logins, and access to sensitive data systems. This significantly enhances protection against unauthorized access. However, there are notable gaps in foundational security policies and training. The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not provide security awareness training for new employees, although annual training is conducted for all staff. The network scan identified an Nginx web server running version 1.18.0 on port 443 (HTTPS). While HTTPS is in use, Nginx 1.18.0 is an older version, which may contain unpatched vulnerabilities.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. This policy is crucial for setting clear expectations regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, data, and networks. Without it, employees may inadvertently engage in risky behaviors, leading to security incidents, data breaches, or compliance violations. This was identified directly from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Organizational Policy</li><li>Employee Behavior</li><li>IT Resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees are not receiving security awareness training upon joining the organization. This leaves them vulnerable to common cyber threats such as phishing, social engineering, and malware from day one. Without initial training, new hires may not understand their role in maintaining security, increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents. This was identified directly from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New Employees</li><li>Organizational Security Posture</li><li>Data Protection</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Nginx Web Server - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nginx web server running on port 443 is identified as version 1.18.0. This version is no longer actively maintained and may contain known vulnerabilities that have been patched in newer releases. Running outdated software increases the risk of exploitation by attackers who can leverage these known flaws to gain unauthorized access, disrupt services, or compromise data. This was identified through the network scan data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Nginx 1.18.0 (HTTPS Service)</li><li>Web Server</li><li>Port 443</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy that clearly outlines guidelines for IT resource usage and data handling. Furthermore, establishing mandatory security awareness training for all new employees upon onboarding is critical to ensure they understand security best practices from the outset. Finally, the Nginx web server should be updated to the latest stable version to mitigate known vulnerabilities and ensure ongoing security support. Regular patching and updates for all software components are essential for maintaining a robust defense against evolving cyber threats.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization has a strong foundation in multi-factor authentication, which is commendable. However, significant vulnerabilities exist in policy enforcement and initial employee training, alongside the use of outdated software. Addressing the lack of an acceptable use policy, implementing immediate security awareness training for new hires, and updating the Nginx web server are crucial next steps to improve overall cybersecurity readiness and reduce the attack surface.</p>
