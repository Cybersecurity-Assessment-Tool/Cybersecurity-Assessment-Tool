        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Based on the provided organizational data, the network's security posture is characterized by a significant lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA) across critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct security awareness training for new employees, although annual training is provided for all employees. The network scan data did not reveal any specific technical vulnerabilities.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to email in the event of compromised credentials (e.g., via phishing or brute-force attacks). Email often contains sensitive information and can be a gateway to other systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for employees to log into their computers. This makes endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are stolen or guessed, potentially leading to lateral movement within the network and data exfiltration.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Access to sensitive data systems does not mandate Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). This poses a critical risk, as a single compromised credential could grant an attacker direct access to confidential information, leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and significant reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>File servers</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines, employees may engage in activities that inadvertently introduce security risks, such as using unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling company data, leading to increased exposure to malware, data loss, and compliance issues.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training upon joining the organization. This leaves new hires vulnerable to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) and unaware of critical security protocols from the outset, potentially making them an easy target for attackers and increasing the overall human risk factor.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points: email systems, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. This single measure will drastically reduce the risk of credential-based attacks. Furthermore, the organization should develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to clearly define expected behavior regarding IT resource usage. It is also crucial to introduce mandatory security awareness training for all new employees as part of their onboarding process, complementing the existing annual training for all staff. Regular reviews of security policies and training content should be conducted to adapt to evolving threat landscapes.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant security vulnerabilities primarily due to the widespread absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for critical access points and gaps in its security awareness program and policy framework. While no technical network vulnerabilities were identified in the provided scan data, the human and access control elements present substantial risks. Addressing these foundational issues by implementing MFA, establishing an acceptable use policy, and enhancing new employee training is paramount to improving the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and resilience against common attack vectors.</p>
