        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes a MySQL database (version 5.7.33) via port 3306, which is openly accessible. Internally, the organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and maintains an employee acceptable use policy. Annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees. However, there are notable gaps, including the absence of MFA for email access and sensitive data systems, and a lack of security awareness training for new employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The MySQL database server, running version 5.7.33, is directly exposed to the network via port 3306. This direct exposure significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and potential compromise of sensitive information stored within the database. The vulnerability was identified through network scanning which revealed the open port and service details.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted internal IP addresses or specific application servers. For a long-term solution, consider placing the database behind a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or within a more secure network segment, accessible only through secure, authenticated channels. Furthermore, enhance the organization's security posture by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised. Finally, establish a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees to ensure they are equipped with essential cybersecurity knowledge from day one, complementing the existing annual training for all staff.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In conclusion, the organization faces a critical 'High' severity risk due to the direct exposure of its MySQL database to the network. While some foundational security measures are in place, such as MFA for computer logins and annual security training, significant vulnerabilities exist in the lack of MFA for email and sensitive data systems, and the absence of security awareness training for new hires. Addressing these gaps, particularly the database exposure and MFA implementation, is crucial for improving the overall security posture and readiness against potential cyber threats.</p>
