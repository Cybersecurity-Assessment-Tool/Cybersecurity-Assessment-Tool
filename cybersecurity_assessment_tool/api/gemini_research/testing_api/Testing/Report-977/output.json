            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network scan revealed an open Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) port (3389), indicating a potential external exposure. Furthermore, a review of organizational policies highlighted significant gaps in identity and access management, specifically the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and sensitive data systems. While MFA is used for computer logins, the lack of it in these critical areas poses a substantial risk. Additionally, the organization currently lacks a comprehensive security awareness training program for both new and existing employees, increasing susceptibility to social engineering and phishing attacks. An acceptable use policy is in place, which is a positive step.",

                        "Risk": "RDP Exposure",
                        "Overview": "An open Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) port (3389) was identified during the network scan. This exposure allows potential attackers to attempt brute-force attacks or exploit vulnerabilities in the RDP service to gain unauthorized access to internal systems. The impact could range from unauthorized data access to full system compromise.",

                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Email Access",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of email account compromise through phishing, credential stuffing, or password reuse attacks. A compromised email account can serve as a gateway for further attacks, including business email compromise (BEC) and access to other linked services.",
                        "Severity": "High",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems",
                        "Overview": "Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for logging into systems containing sensitive data. This leaves critical organizational data vulnerable to unauthorized access if a user's primary password is stolen or compromised. The impact could be severe, including data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and reputational damage.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Insufficient Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees, nor does it provide annual training for all employees. This lack of ongoing education leaves the workforce unprepared to identify and respond to common cyber threats such as phishing, malware, and social engineering attacks, making them a significant vulnerability in the organization's security posture.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "Organizational data",
                            "Network infrastructure",
                            "Human factor"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately close the externally exposed RDP port (3389) and implement a secure Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution for all remote access requirements. Furthermore, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be implemented and enforced for all email access and for all systems containing sensitive data to significantly reduce the risk of account compromise. Finally, a comprehensive security awareness training program should be established, including mandatory training for all new employees and annual refresher courses for the entire workforce, to enhance the human firewall against social engineering and phishing attacks.",
            "Conclusion": "The current cybersecurity assessment reveals critical vulnerabilities stemming from an exposed RDP service, a pervasive lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for email and sensitive data systems, and an absence of regular security awareness training. While an acceptable use policy is in place and MFA is used for computer logins, these deficiencies collectively indicate a low state of readiness against sophisticated cyber threats. Addressing these issues promptly through the recommended actions is crucial to significantly enhance the organization's security posture and protect its assets from potential breaches."
