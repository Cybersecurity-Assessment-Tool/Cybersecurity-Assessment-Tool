        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational level of security readiness by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and computer logins, and maintaining an acceptable use policy for employees. However, several critical gaps were identified. The network scan revealed an open port 80, indicating a potential entry point or unencrypted service. Furthermore, the organization lacks MFA for sensitive data systems, and critically, does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or provide annual refresher training for all staff. These deficiencies expose the organization to significant risks related to unauthorized access, social engineering, and human error.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Multi-Factor Authentication for Sensitive Data - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information should credentials be compromised through phishing, malware, or other means. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to sensitive data, leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and reputational damage. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Initial Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. This leaves new hires potentially unaware of critical security policies, common threats (like phishing, malware, and social engineering tactics), and best practices for data handling and system usage. This lack of foundational knowledge makes new employees more susceptible to falling victim to cyberattacks, thereby increasing the overall human risk factor for the organization. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Recurring Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. Regular and ongoing training is crucial to keep employees updated on evolving threats, reinforce security best practices, and maintain a strong security culture. The absence of such recurring training leads to a degradation of security knowledge over time, increasing the likelihood of human error-related incidents, successful phishing attacks, and insider threats. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open HTTP Port (Port 80) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A network scan identified an open port 80 (HTTP) on a host within the network. While HTTP is a standard protocol for web traffic, an open port 80 without proper security configurations (e.g., mandatory redirection to HTTPS, robust web application firewall, up-to-date server software, and minimal exposure) can expose the organization to various web-based attacks. These include unencrypted data transmission, server vulnerabilities, information disclosure, and potential entry points for attackers. This vulnerability was identified through the network scan data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with open port 80</li><li>Web server (if applicable)</li><li>Network perimeter</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, the organization should immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access. Concurrently, a comprehensive security awareness training program must be established, including mandatory training for all new employees upon onboarding and annual refresher training for all existing staff. This will significantly improve employee vigilance against social engineering and other threats. Furthermore, the service running on port 80 should be thoroughly reviewed. It is strongly recommended to enforce HTTPS for all web traffic, apply all necessary security patches to the underlying server and application, and consider implementing a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect against common web exploits. If the service is not critical, consider closing the port.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has implemented some basic security controls such as MFA for email and computer logins, and an acceptable use policy, significant vulnerabilities remain. The lack of MFA for sensitive data systems and the complete absence of security awareness training for both new and existing employees represent critical gaps that expose the organization to a high risk of data breaches and successful cyberattacks. The presence of an open HTTP port further compounds these risks. Addressing these issues through the recommended security enhancements and training programs is paramount to improving the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and readiness against evolving threats.</p>
