            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network currently presents several critical and high-severity vulnerabilities across its infrastructure and operational policies. Key findings include the presence of an outdated operating system (Windows 7) on workstations, an FTP server allowing anonymous access, and a significant lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for both email and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization's security awareness training program does not cover new employees, introducing a potential human element risk from the start. While an acceptable use policy is in place and annual security training is conducted for all employees, these measures are insufficient to mitigate the identified technical and policy gaps.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Outdated Windows Policy",
                        "Overview": "Computers are running Windows 7, which is an end-of-life operating system. This means it no longer receives security updates, making systems highly vulnerable to known and newly discovered exploits. The impact is a significant increase in the risk of system compromise, data breaches, and malware infections. This vulnerability was identified from existing risk data.",
                        "Severity": "High",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Anonymous FTP Access Allowed",
                        "Overview": "The Nmap scan identified an open FTP service (vsftpd 2.3.4) on port 21, which allows anonymous login. This means unauthorized users can access and potentially modify or exfiltrate files stored on the FTP server without authentication. This poses a significant risk of data exposure, unauthorized data manipulation, and potential for further system compromise. This vulnerability was identified via network scan data and the 'ftp-anon' script output.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                    {
                        "Risk": "No MFA for Email Access",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing, as a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to an employee's email. The impact includes potential for business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and lateral movement within the network. This vulnerability was identified from organizational policy data.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "No MFA for Sensitive Data Systems",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are compromised. An attacker gaining access could lead to severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and significant reputational and financial damage. This vulnerability was identified from organizational policy data.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Inadequate New Employee Security Training",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. This means new hires may not be aware of common cybersecurity threats (e.g., phishing, social engineering) or organizational security policies from the outset. This increases the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents, as new employees are often targeted by attackers. This vulnerability was identified from organizational policy data.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "New employees",
                            "Organizational security posture"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately upgrade all workstations running Windows 7 to a currently supported operating system like Windows 10 or 11. For the FTP server, anonymous access must be disabled, and access should be restricted to authenticated users with strong password policies, or ideally, replaced with a more secure file transfer solution. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all email systems and sensitive data systems to significantly enhance account security and prevent unauthorized access even if primary credentials are compromised. Furthermore, establish a comprehensive security awareness training program for all new employees, covering essential topics such as phishing, social engineering, and data handling best practices, to build a strong security culture from day one.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization faces significant cybersecurity risks due to outdated operating systems, insecure network services, and critical gaps in access control policies, particularly the lack of MFA for key systems. While some foundational policies are in place, the current readiness is low given the severity of the identified vulnerabilities. Addressing these issues promptly through system upgrades, policy enforcement, and enhanced training is crucial to prevent potential data breaches, system compromises, and maintain a robust security posture."
