        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network includes an FTP server running vsftpd 2.3.4, which was found to allow anonymous login. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is mandated for email and computer logins, it is notably absent for access to sensitive data systems. An acceptable use policy is in place, and annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees. However, new employees do not receive initial security awareness training. Furthermore, several workstations are operating on Windows 7, an end-of-life operating system.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Anonymous FTP Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nmap scan identified an open FTP service (vsftpd 2.3.4) on port 21, which allows anonymous login. This poses a significant risk as unauthorized users could potentially upload or download files, leading to data breaches, data integrity issues, or the introduction of malicious content. vsftpd 2.3.4 is also an outdated version, potentially having other known vulnerabilities.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>FTP Server (vsftpd 2.3.4)</li><li>Port 21</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or other means. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant full access to sensitive data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive Data Systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate New Employee Security Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. This means new hires may not be immediately aware of critical security policies, best practices, and common threats (e.g., phishing, social engineering), making them more susceptible to falling victim to attacks and potentially introducing vulnerabilities into the network.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New Employees</li><li>Organizational Security Posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Windows Policy - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Computers are running Windows 7. Windows 7 has reached its end-of-life, meaning it no longer receives security updates from Microsoft. This leaves systems vulnerable to newly discovered exploits and malware, significantly increasing the risk of compromise and making them a prime target for attackers.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediate action is required to disable anonymous FTP access and, if FTP functionality is essential, transition to secure protocols like SFTP or FTPS with strong authentication, while also upgrading the vsftpd server to a current, supported version. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be implemented without delay for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access. A mandatory security awareness training program should be established for all new employees as part of their onboarding process to ensure they are aware of critical security policies and threats from day one. Furthermore, all workstations running Windows 7 must be upgraded to a currently supported operating system, such as Windows 10 or 11, to ensure they receive vital security updates and mitigate the risk of exploitation.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization faces several critical vulnerabilities, including an anonymously accessible and outdated FTP server, a lack of MFA for sensitive data systems, and the continued use of end-of-life Windows 7 on workstations. While annual security training is commendable, the absence of initial training for new employees presents a significant gap. These issues collectively indicate a moderate to high-risk security posture, necessitating urgent remediation to protect sensitive data and maintain operational integrity.</p>
