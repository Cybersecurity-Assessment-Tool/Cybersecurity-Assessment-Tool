        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network shows an open FTP service running an outdated version of vsftpd (2.3.4) with anonymous login enabled, posing a critical data breach risk. Internally, several critical policy and training gaps exist, including the absence of MFA for email access, no employee acceptable use policy, and a complete lack of security awareness training for both new and existing employees. Furthermore, workstations are running outdated Windows 7, which is past its end-of-life and highly vulnerable.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Anonymous FTP Access & Outdated vsftpd - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The network scan identified an open FTP service (port 21) running vsftpd version 2.3.4. This version is significantly outdated (released in 2011) and known to have multiple vulnerabilities. Critically, the service allows anonymous FTP login, which means unauthorized users can access and potentially modify files on the FTP server without credentials. This could lead to data exposure, unauthorized data modification, or even system compromise.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>FTP Server (vsftpd 2.3.4)</li><li>Network Port 21</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or stolen credentials. If an attacker gains access to an employee's email, it can be used for further internal phishing, data exfiltration, or to reset passwords for other services.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email System</li><li>Employee Accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without a clear AUP, employees may not understand their responsibilities regarding company assets, data handling, and internet usage. This can lead to unintentional security breaches, misuse of company resources, and non-compliance with industry regulations.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Organizational Policy</li><li>Employee Conduct</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees, nor does it provide annual training for all employees. This leaves the workforce vulnerable to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, vishing), malware, and other common cyber threats. A lack of training significantly increases the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All Employees</li><li>Organizational Security Culture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Windows Operating Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Computers within the organization are running Windows 7. Windows 7 reached its end-of-life in January 2020, meaning it no longer receives security updates or technical support from Microsoft. This leaves systems highly vulnerable to known and newly discovered exploits, making them easy targets for malware and attackers.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediately disable anonymous FTP access and update or decommission the vsftpd service (version 2.3.4) on port 21. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts to significantly reduce the risk of account compromise. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy (AUP) to guide employee behavior regarding company assets and data. Establish mandatory security awareness training for all new hires and conduct annual refresher training for all employees to educate them on current cyber threats and best practices. Prioritize upgrading all workstations running Windows 7 to a currently supported operating system like Windows 10 or 11 to ensure they receive critical security updates.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks stemming from both technical vulnerabilities and critical policy/training gaps. The presence of an outdated FTP server with anonymous access, coupled with the use of end-of-life Windows 7 workstations, creates immediate and severe technical exposure. Furthermore, the absence of MFA for email, an acceptable use policy, and any form of security awareness training leaves the organization highly susceptible to social engineering and human error. Addressing these fundamental issues is paramount to improving the overall security posture and readiness against cyber threats.</p>
