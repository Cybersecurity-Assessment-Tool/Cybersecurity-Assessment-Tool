        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, and maintaining an acceptable use policy. Annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees. However, a critical gap exists in the absence of MFA for email access, which is a common vector for initial compromise. Furthermore, new employees are not provided with initial security awareness training, leaving them vulnerable to social engineering attacks during their onboarding period. The network scan data indicates no immediately apparent open ports, suggesting a basic level of perimeter security, though this is a limited view.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. Compromised email accounts can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and further lateral movement within the network. This was identified from the organizational data stating 'Do you require MFA to access email?':'No'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee email accounts</li><li>Email server/service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) as they may be less familiar with organizational security policies, common attack vectors, and how to identify suspicious activities. This lack of initial training leaves the organization vulnerable to human-factor risks from the moment a new employee joins. This was identified from the organizational data stating 'Does your organization do security awareness training for new employees?':'No'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure (via potential compromise through new employees)</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access. This is a critical control to prevent unauthorized access to email accounts, which are frequently targeted. Additionally, a comprehensive security awareness training program should be established for all new employees as part of their onboarding process. This training should cover common threats like phishing, social engineering tactics, and the organization's specific security policies and reporting procedures. While annual training is beneficial, the initial period for new hires is a high-risk window that needs to be addressed proactively.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization has a mixed security posture, demonstrating strengths in some areas like MFA for sensitive systems and annual security training, but exhibiting significant vulnerabilities in email security and new employee onboarding. The absence of MFA for email access represents a high-severity risk that could lead to severe business disruption and data breaches. The lack of initial security awareness training for new hires also creates an unnecessary exposure to human-factor risks. Addressing these specific gaps is crucial for enhancing the overall cybersecurity readiness and resilience of the organization.</p>
