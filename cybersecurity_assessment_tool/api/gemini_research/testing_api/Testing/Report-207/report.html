        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes a MySQL database on port 3306, indicating a potential direct access vulnerability. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for email and computer logins, a critical gap exists as MFA is not required for accessing sensitive data systems. The organization has an acceptable use policy and conducts security awareness training for new employees, which are positive steps. However, there is a significant oversight in not providing annual security awareness training for all employees, leaving the workforce potentially susceptible to evolving threats.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network, which could allow unauthorized access to the database if not properly secured with strong authentication and access controls. This direct exposure increases the attack surface and the risk of data breaches or unauthorized data manipulation. The vulnerability was identified through network scanning data showing an open port.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if user credentials are compromised, as a single factor (password) would be sufficient for authentication. This gap was identified through organizational policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This leaves the workforce vulnerable to evolving social engineering attacks, phishing, and other human-factor exploits. Without regular updates on current threats and best practices, employees are more likely to fall victim to attacks, potentially leading to data breaches or system compromises. This deficiency was identified through organizational policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted IP addresses or via a secure VPN. For sensitive data systems, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be enforced without delay to significantly enhance access security. Furthermore, a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees should be established to ensure continuous education on current cybersecurity threats and best practices, thereby strengthening the human firewall.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational level of security readiness with MFA for email and computer logins, an acceptable use policy, and new employee security training. However, critical vulnerabilities exist, including an exposed MySQL database, the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems, and a lack of annual security awareness training for all employees. Addressing these high and medium severity risks is paramount to improving the overall security posture and reducing the likelihood of a successful cyberattack or data breach.</p>
