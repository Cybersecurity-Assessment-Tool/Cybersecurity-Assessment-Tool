        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) on port 3389, which is a critical vulnerability. While the organization implements security awareness training for all employees annually and requires MFA for computer logins, there are significant gaps in its security posture. Specifically, MFA is not required for accessing email or sensitive data systems, and there is no employee acceptable use policy in place. These factors collectively increase the organization's attack surface and overall risk.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>RDP Exposure - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed to the internet via an open port (3389), allowing potential attackers to attempt brute-force attacks or exploit vulnerabilities in the RDP service. This can lead to unauthorized access to internal systems, data breaches, and potential network compromise. This vulnerability was identified through a network scan showing port 3389 as open.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified RDP exposure, it is strongly recommended to immediately close port 3389 to the internet. For secure remote access, implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution. Additionally, enhance the organization's security posture by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and sensitive data systems. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to define expected behavior and reduce insider threats.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces a critical vulnerability due to an exposed RDP service, significantly increasing the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches. While security awareness training is a positive step, the absence of MFA for critical systems like email and sensitive data, coupled with the lack of an acceptable use policy, indicates substantial gaps in the overall security posture. Addressing these issues is paramount to improving the organization's cybersecurity readiness and reducing its attack surface.</p>
