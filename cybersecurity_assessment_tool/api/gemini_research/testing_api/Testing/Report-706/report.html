        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, and conducting annual security awareness training for all employees. An acceptable use policy is also in place. However, two significant gaps were identified: the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems and the lack of dedicated security awareness training for new employees. These areas represent potential entry points for attackers and could lead to data compromise or operational disruption.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Access Control for Sensitive Data - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if credentials are compromised through phishing, malware, or other means. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to sensitive data. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data provided, specifically the response indicating no MFA for sensitive data systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Onboarding Security Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. This leaves new hires vulnerable to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) and unaware of critical security policies and best practices from the start of their employment. This can lead to accidental data breaches, malware infections, or policy violations. While annual training is conducted, the initial onboarding period is a critical gap where employees are most susceptible. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data provided, specifically the response indicating no security awareness training for new employees.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems. This should be a priority to protect critical information from unauthorized access and significantly reduce the impact of compromised credentials. Furthermore, a comprehensive security awareness training program specifically for new employees must be established. This training should cover essential security policies, common threat vectors like phishing, and best practices from day one of employment to build a strong security culture from the outset. Regular reviews of security policies and training content are also advised to ensure they remain current and effective.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has some robust security controls in place, particularly regarding MFA for general access and annual security training, the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems and the lack of initial security awareness training for new employees represent critical vulnerabilities. Addressing these gaps is essential to enhance the overall security posture, reduce the risk of data breaches, and ensure a more resilient defense against evolving cyber threats. Proactive measures in these areas will significantly improve the organization's readiness against potential attacks.</p>
