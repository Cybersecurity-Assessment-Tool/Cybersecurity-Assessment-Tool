        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed a critical exposure: an open port 8080 hosting a service titled 'TOP SECRET DB'. This indicates a direct and severe risk of sensitive data exposure. Furthermore, an assessment of organizational policies identified significant security gaps, including the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins, which increases the risk of unauthorized access through compromised credentials. The lack of an employee acceptable use policy also presents a foundational weakness, as it leaves employees without clear guidelines for secure IT resource usage. While security awareness training is conducted, these fundamental vulnerabilities significantly undermine the organization's overall security posture.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed 'TOP SECRET DB' on Open Port 8080 - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Port 8080 was found to be open and hosting a service with the title 'TOP SECRET DB'. This directly exposes what appears to be a highly sensitive database or application to the network, potentially to the internet if not properly firewalled. The presence of 'TOP SECRET DB' in the title suggests critical data is at risk of unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or manipulation. This vulnerability was identified via an Nmap scan that detected the open port and the HTTP title.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li><li>TOP SECRET DB application/database</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This means that a single factor (typically a password) is sufficient for authentication, making systems highly vulnerable to credential theft, phishing attacks, and brute-force attempts. If an attacker obtains an employee's password, they can gain unauthorized access to internal systems without an additional layer of security. This policy gap was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network access points</li><li>Authentication systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines, employees may engage in activities that inadvertently introduce security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive data. This absence creates a significant governance gap, increasing the likelihood of insider threats, malware infections, and data breaches due to unapproved or insecure practices. This policy gap was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediate action is required to address the critical exposure of the 'TOP SECRET DB' on port 8080. This involves thoroughly investigating the service, implementing strict access controls, closing the port if not essential, or placing it behind a robust firewall with strong authentication and encryption. Concurrently, the organization must implement mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to significantly enhance protection against credential-based attacks. Furthermore, a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy should be developed, communicated, and enforced to establish clear guidelines for secure IT resource usage and mitigate risks associated with employee behavior. Regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing should be conducted to proactively identify and remediate similar exposures.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization is currently operating with critical security vulnerabilities, most notably the direct exposure of a 'TOP SECRET DB' on an open network port and the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for computer logins. These issues present immediate and severe risks of unauthorized access and data compromise. The lack of an acceptable use policy further weakens the overall security posture by failing to establish clear behavioral guidelines for employees. While security awareness training is in place, these fundamental gaps require urgent attention and remediation to elevate the organization's cybersecurity readiness and protect its sensitive assets from potential threats.</p>
