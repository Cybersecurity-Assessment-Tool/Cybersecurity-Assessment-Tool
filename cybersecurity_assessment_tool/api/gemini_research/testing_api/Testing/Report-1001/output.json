            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to security fundamentals by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, security awareness training is consistently provided for new employees and conducted annually for all staff, which are commendable practices. However, a critical vulnerability was identified with an open Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) port (3389), posing a significant external attack surface. Additionally, a notable gap exists in the absence of an employee acceptable use policy, which could lead to inconsistent security practices and increased risk exposure.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "RDP Exposure",
                        "Overview": "Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) port 3389 was found to be open and accessible from the internet. This exposes the organization to potential brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, and unauthorized access attempts, which could lead to system compromise, data breaches, or ransomware infections. This vulnerability was identified through an Nmap network scan.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Port 3389",
                            "ms-wbt-server"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Missing Acceptable Use Policy",
                        "Overview": "The organization currently lacks a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy. This absence creates a significant risk as it leaves employees without clear guidelines regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, data handling, and internet usage. This can lead to increased exposure to malware, data leakage, and non-compliance issues, as well as potential legal liabilities. This was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Organizational Policy",
                            "Employee Conduct",
                            "IT Resources"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately close port 3389 if RDP access is not absolutely essential. If remote access is required, implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) for secure access to internal resources, ensuring RDP is only accessible via the VPN tunnel. Additionally, enforce strong, unique passwords and multi-factor authentication for all RDP accounts. Concurrently, develop and implement a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy that clearly outlines expectations for IT resource usage, data handling, and security best practices. Ensure all employees review and acknowledge this policy, and integrate it into new employee onboarding and annual security awareness training.",
            "Conclusion": "While the organization has established a solid foundation with MFA implementation and regular security awareness training, the presence of an open RDP port represents a critical and immediate threat that requires urgent attention. The absence of an acceptable use policy also presents a significant policy gap that could lead to various security incidents. Addressing these vulnerabilities is crucial for improving the overall security posture and reducing the organization's attack surface."
