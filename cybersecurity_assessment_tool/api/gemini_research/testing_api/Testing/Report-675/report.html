        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes a MySQL database (version 5.7.33) on port 3306. Furthermore, the organization lacks multi-factor authentication (MFA) for email access and computer logins, although it is implemented for sensitive data systems. There is an acceptable use policy in place, but security awareness training for both new and existing employees is not conducted. This indicates significant gaps in both network perimeter security and internal security practices.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network. This exposes the database to potential unauthorized access and exploitation, which could lead to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service. The vulnerability was identified through a network port scan showing an open MySQL port.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for email access. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing or brute-force attacks, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive communications and internal systems. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for computer logins. This makes it easier for attackers to gain unauthorized access to employee workstations and internal networks if credentials are compromised, increasing the risk of lateral movement and data exfiltration. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Internal network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or annually for all employees. This leaves employees vulnerable to social engineering attacks, phishing, and other common threats, increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data and systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is recommended to immediately implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306 to only trusted internal IP addresses or specific application servers. For long-term security, consider placing the database behind a VPN or implementing a more robust access control mechanism. Furthermore, multi-factor authentication should be mandated for all email accounts and computer logins across the organization to significantly reduce the risk of credential compromise. A comprehensive security awareness training program for all new hires and annual refresher training for all employees should be established, covering topics such as phishing, social engineering, password hygiene, and data handling best practices. Regular review and updates of security policies and configurations are also crucial to ensure alignment with current threat landscapes.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to an exposed MySQL database and critical gaps in its internal security posture, specifically the lack of multi-factor authentication for email and computer logins, and the complete absence of security awareness training for employees. While an acceptable use policy is in place and MFA is used for sensitive data systems, these measures are insufficient to protect against the identified vulnerabilities. Addressing these issues promptly through network segmentation, MFA implementation, and comprehensive employee training is crucial to enhance the organization's overall security readiness and reduce its attack surface.</p>
