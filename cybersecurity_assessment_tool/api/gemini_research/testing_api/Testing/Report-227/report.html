        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open SSH port (22). From an organizational security standpoint, the company has an acceptable use policy in place and conducts annual security awareness training for all employees. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enforced for computer logins and access to sensitive data systems. However, a critical gap exists as MFA is not required for email access, and new employees do not receive initial security awareness training upon joining the organization.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A critical vulnerability was identified where a service or configuration appears to expose localhost, potentially allowing local processes to be accessed externally or creating an attack surface for privilege escalation if an attacker gains initial access. The impact could be severe, leading to unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or system compromise. This was identified through a security assessment that flagged an internal exposure with a CVSS score of 10.0.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediate action is required to investigate and remediate the 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability. Ensure that no internal services are inadvertently exposed to external networks or accessible in a way that could be exploited. Furthermore, it is strongly recommended to implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for email access to significantly reduce the risk of phishing and credential stuffing attacks. Introduce mandatory security awareness training for all new employees during their onboarding process to ensure they understand security best practices from day one. Finally, review the necessity of the open SSH port (22) and, if required, ensure it is adequately secured with strong authentication, rate limiting, and restricted access (e.g., IP whitelisting).</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security with MFA for critical systems and annual security training. However, significant gaps exist, including the lack of MFA for email and initial security training for new hires. The identified 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability presents a critical risk that requires immediate attention. Addressing these vulnerabilities and implementing the recommended security controls will substantially enhance the organization's overall security posture and readiness against cyber threats.</p>
