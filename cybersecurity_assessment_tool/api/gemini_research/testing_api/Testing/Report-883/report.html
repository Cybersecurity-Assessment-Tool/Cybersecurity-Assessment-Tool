        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open SSH port (22) on at least one host, indicating potential remote access capabilities that require robust security measures. From an organizational policy standpoint, the company demonstrates good practice by requiring MFA for email and computer logins. However, critical gaps exist in securing sensitive data systems, as MFA is not mandated for these. Furthermore, the absence of an employee acceptable use policy and the lack of annual security awareness training for all employees represent significant human-factor vulnerabilities that could lead to data breaches or misuse of company resources.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or other means. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access, leading to potential data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and reputational damage. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on sensitive data systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). This means there are no clear guidelines for employees regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, internet, email, and data. The absence of an AUP can lead to misuse of company assets, increased exposure to malware, data breaches, and legal liabilities, as employees may unknowingly engage in risky behaviors or fail to report suspicious activities. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for an AUP.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Network infrastructure</li><li>Organizational data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Recurring Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual or regular security awareness training for all employees. This leads to a degradation of security knowledge over time, making employees more susceptible to evolving social engineering tactics, phishing attacks, and other cyber threats. A lack of continuous education leaves the organization vulnerable to human error, which is a common vector for breaches. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for annual security awareness training.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network security</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port (Port 22) - <span class="severity-Low">Low</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An Nmap scan revealed that port 22 (SSH) is open on a host within the network. While SSH is a legitimate service for remote administration, an open port 22, if not properly secured with strong authentication (e.g., key-based authentication, MFA), rate limiting, and restricted access, can be a target for brute-force attacks or other exploits. This increases the attack surface of the network and could potentially allow unauthorized remote access if not adequately protected. This was identified via the Nmap scan data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with open port 22</li><li>Network perimeter</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access. Concurrently, develop and enforce a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) that clearly outlines expectations for IT resource usage and data handling. This policy should be communicated to all employees and acknowledged. Furthermore, establish a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees to ensure continuous education on current cyber threats and best security practices. For the open SSH port, review its necessity and ensure it is secured with strong, key-based authentication, disabled password authentication, IP-based access restrictions, and regular patching.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently exhibits a mixed security posture. While some foundational security controls like MFA for email and computer logins are in place, significant vulnerabilities exist concerning sensitive data access, employee conduct, and ongoing security education. The presence of an open SSH port also warrants immediate attention to prevent potential exploitation. Addressing these critical gaps is essential to enhance the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and reduce its exposure to common cyber threats.</p>
