        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization operates a web server running Nginx version 1.18.0, accessible via HTTPS on port 443. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for email access, it is notably absent for computer logins and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization lacks fundamental security practices such as an employee acceptable use policy and any form of security awareness training for both new and existing employees. This indicates significant gaps in both technical and human-centric security controls, leaving the organization vulnerable to various cyber threats.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Nginx Server Version - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nginx web server is running version 1.18.0. This version was released in April 2020 and is no longer actively maintained, meaning it does not receive security updates. Running outdated software exposes the organization to known vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers, leading to data breaches, denial of service, or unauthorized access. This was identified through the network scan data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Nginx 1.18.0 (port 443)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or malware. A single factor (password) is insufficient to protect against modern threats. This was identified from the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee computer login systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk, as compromised credentials could grant attackers direct access to confidential information, leading to severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and reputational damage. This was identified from the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without a clear AUP, employees may be unaware of their responsibilities regarding the use of company IT resources, data handling, and internet usage. This can lead to risky behaviors, increased exposure to malware, and potential data leaks, as there are no defined guidelines for secure conduct. This was identified from the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>IT systems</li><li>Organizational data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or on an annual basis for all employees. This leaves the workforce vulnerable to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting), malware, and other human-centric threats. Employees are often the first line of defense, and a lack of training significantly weakens the overall security posture, increasing the likelihood of successful attacks. This was identified from the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>IT infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, the organization should immediately upgrade the Nginx web server to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities and ensure ongoing security support. It is critical to mandate Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and, especially, for access to all sensitive data systems to protect against credential compromise. Furthermore, the organization must establish and enforce a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) that clearly outlines expectations for secure behavior, data handling, and IT resource usage. Finally, implementing mandatory security awareness training for all new employees during onboarding and conducting annual refresher training for all staff is essential to build a human firewall against social engineering and other human-centric threats.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks stemming from both technical vulnerabilities and critical gaps in security policies and employee training. The use of an outdated Nginx server poses an immediate technical threat, while the absence of MFA for computer and sensitive data access leaves core systems highly susceptible to credential-based attacks. Furthermore, the lack of an acceptable use policy and any form of security awareness training indicates a low state of readiness against human-centric threats, which are often the most common attack vectors. Addressing these fundamental issues is crucial for improving the organization's overall security posture and reducing its exposure to potential breaches.</p>
