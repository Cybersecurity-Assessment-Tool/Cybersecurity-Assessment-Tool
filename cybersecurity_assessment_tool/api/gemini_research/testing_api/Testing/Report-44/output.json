            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network scan data indicates an active host with port 80 (HTTP) open, suggesting a potential web service. Analysis of the organizational data reveals critical gaps in identity and access management, as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for email access or computer logins, although it is utilized for sensitive data systems. While an acceptable use policy is in place and annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees, new hires do not receive specific security awareness training upon onboarding. This mixed security posture highlights significant areas for improvement in protecting user credentials and educating new personnel.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Email Access",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing, as a single compromised password would grant full access. This vulnerability was identified from the organizational data.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Email system",
                            "Employee email accounts"
                        ]

                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Computer Login",
                        "Overview": "Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for logging into computers within the organization. This leaves computer systems vulnerable to unauthorized access if employee credentials are stolen or guessed. Without a second factor, attackers can gain direct access to internal systems and data once a password is compromised. This vulnerability was identified from the organizational data.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All organizational computers",
                            "Employee workstations",

                    {
                        "Risk": "No Security Awareness Training for New Employees",
                        "Overview": "While the organization conducts annual security awareness training for all employees, new employees do not receive specific training upon onboarding. This creates a period where new hires may be unaware of critical security policies, common threats (like phishing), and best practices, making them more susceptible to social engineering attacks and potentially introducing vulnerabilities into the network. This vulnerability was identified from the organizational data.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "New employees",

                            "Potential for social engineering"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Open HTTP Port (80)",
                        "Overview": "A network scan revealed that port 80 (HTTP) is open on an active host. While not a vulnerability in itself, an open HTTP port indicates that a web server is likely running and potentially serving unencrypted traffic. This could expose sensitive information transmitted over the network to eavesdropping if HTTPS is not enforced or if the web service is outdated and contains known vulnerabilities. This was identified from the network scan data.",
                        "Severity": "Low",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Host with open port 80",
                            "Web server",
                            "Network traffic"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, the organization should immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and computer logins to significantly enhance identity and access management security. A comprehensive security awareness training program should be established for all new employees as part of their onboarding process, covering essential security policies and threat recognition. Furthermore, the organization should review the service running on port 80, ensuring that HTTPS is enforced for all web traffic, that the web server software is fully patched and up-to-date, and that unnecessary services are disabled to reduce the attack surface. Regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing should also be conducted to proactively identify and address potential weaknesses.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces significant security vulnerabilities primarily related to identity and access management, specifically the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for email and computer logins. The absence of dedicated security awareness training for new employees also presents a notable risk. While some foundational security practices like an acceptable use policy and annual training are in place, these gaps leave the organization susceptible to common attack vectors such as credential compromise and social engineering. Addressing these critical areas will substantially improve the organization's overall security posture and readiness against cyber threats."
