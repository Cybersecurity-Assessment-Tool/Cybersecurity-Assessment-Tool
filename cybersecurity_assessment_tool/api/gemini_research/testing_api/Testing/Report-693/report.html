        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization has implemented multi-factor authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, indicating a strong baseline for access control. An employee acceptable use policy is also in place. However, a critical vulnerability was identified during the network scan, and a significant gap exists in the security awareness training program for new employees, which could expose the organization to increased human-factor risks.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Database - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A network scan revealed an open port 8080, which is hosting a service explicitly titled 'TOP SECRET DB'. This indicates that a database containing highly sensitive information is directly exposed to the network, potentially without adequate authentication, authorization, or encryption. Direct exposure of such a critical asset poses an extreme risk of unauthorized access, data exfiltration, and severe data breaches, leading to significant financial, reputational, and legal consequences.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li><li>Service 'TOP SECRET DB'</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently does not provide security awareness training for new employees. This leaves new hires vulnerable to social engineering attacks, phishing attempts, and other human-centric exploits from the outset. Without proper initial training, new employees may inadvertently introduce malware, disclose sensitive information, or violate security policies, thereby increasing the overall risk of security incidents and breaches.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified critical risks, immediate action is required. The 'TOP SECRET DB' exposed on port 8080 must be secured without delay. This involves implementing robust network segmentation, strong authentication mechanisms, encryption for data in transit and at rest, and restricting access to only authorized personnel and systems. Ideally, the database should be moved behind a secure firewall and accessed only through a secure application layer. Furthermore, a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees must be established and integrated into the onboarding process. This training should cover essential topics such as phishing identification, social engineering tactics, secure data handling, password hygiene, and adherence to the organization's acceptable use policy. Regular refresher training for all employees should also be maintained and enhanced to address evolving threat landscapes.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has a commendable foundation with MFA implementation and an acceptable use policy, its overall cybersecurity readiness is significantly compromised by the critical exposure of a 'TOP SECRET DB' and the complete absence of initial security awareness training for new employees. These vulnerabilities represent substantial attack surfaces that could lead to severe data breaches, operational disruptions, and reputational damage. Addressing these critical gaps is paramount to enhancing the organization's security posture and effectively managing its risk profile.</p>
