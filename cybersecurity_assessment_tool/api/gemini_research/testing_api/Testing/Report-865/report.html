        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed a single active host with an open HTTPS port (443) running Nginx version 1.18.0. This indicates a web server is operational and accessible. Organizational data indicates strong MFA adoption across critical systems but highlights gaps in security policies and ongoing employee training.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Web Server Software - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nginx web server identified is running version 1.18.0. This version was released in April 2020 and is no longer actively maintained, meaning it does not receive security updates. Running outdated software exposes the organization to known vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers, leading to data breaches, denial of service, or unauthorized access. This was identified via network scanning.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Nginx 1.18.0 on port 443</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This policy is crucial for defining expected employee behavior regarding company assets, data, and network usage. Without clear guidelines, employees may inadvertently engage in risky activities, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive data, increasing the risk of security incidents and legal liabilities. This was identified through organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual training for all employees. Cybersecurity threats evolve rapidly, and regular training is essential to keep employees informed about new attack vectors (e.g., phishing techniques, social engineering), best practices, and their role in maintaining security. The absence of ongoing training increases the likelihood of employees falling victim to sophisticated attacks, potentially compromising systems and data. This was identified through organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately upgrade the Nginx web server to the latest stable and supported version to address known vulnerabilities and ensure ongoing security updates. Furthermore, the organization should develop and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy, clearly outlining expectations for secure behavior and technology usage. Finally, a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees must be established and regularly updated to educate staff on evolving cyber threats and reinforce secure practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a strong posture regarding multi-factor authentication for critical systems, which is a commendable security control. However, significant vulnerabilities exist due to an outdated web server and critical gaps in foundational security policies and ongoing employee education. Addressing the outdated Nginx server and implementing both an acceptable use policy and annual security awareness training are paramount to enhancing the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and reducing its attack surface.</p>
