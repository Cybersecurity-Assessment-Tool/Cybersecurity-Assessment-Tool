        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed a single active host with an open HTTPS service running Nginx version 1.18.0. While this version is stable, it is not the latest, suggesting potential for outdated software. Organizational data indicates strong MFA implementation for computer logins and sensitive data systems. However, critical gaps exist in security posture, specifically the absence of MFA for email access, a lack of an employee acceptable use policy, and no security awareness training for new employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. Email accounts are frequently targeted by phishing attacks and credential stuffing. Without MFA, a compromised password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's email, leading to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and further lateral movement within the network. This was identified through the organizational survey data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>All employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). An AUP defines the proper and acceptable use of organizational IT resources, including computers, networks, and data. Without clear guidelines, employees may inadvertently engage in risky behaviors, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive information, increasing the risk of security incidents, data breaches, and compliance violations. This was identified through the organizational survey data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational IT resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not provide security awareness training for new employees. While annual training is conducted for all employees, new hires are particularly vulnerable as they may not be immediately aware of the organization's specific security policies, common threats (e.g., phishing, social engineering), or best practices for handling sensitive information. This gap increases the likelihood of new employees falling victim to attacks, potentially compromising organizational systems or data from the outset of their employment. This was identified through the organizational survey data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational data and systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Nginx Web Server - <span class="severity-Low">Low</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The web server identified on port 443 is running Nginx version 1.18.0. While Nginx 1.18.0 is a stable release, it was published in 2020 and may contain known vulnerabilities that have been patched in newer versions. Running outdated software increases the attack surface, as attackers can exploit publicly known CVEs to gain unauthorized access, disrupt services, or compromise the server. This was identified via network scanning.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Web server (Nginx 1.18.0)</li><li>Port 443</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, the following actions are recommended: 1. Implement MFA for Email Access: Immediately enforce Multi-Factor Authentication for all email accounts. This significantly reduces the risk of account compromise from phishing and credential stuffing attacks. 2. Develop and Enforce an Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP): Create a comprehensive AUP that clearly outlines acceptable use of IT resources. Distribute it to all employees, ensure they acknowledge understanding, and integrate it into onboarding processes. 3. Introduce Security Awareness Training for New Employees: Establish a mandatory security awareness training program for all new hires as part of their onboarding process. This should cover common threats, organizational policies, and best practices from day one. 4. Update Nginx Web Server: Plan and execute an upgrade of the Nginx web server to the latest stable version. Regularly review and apply security patches and updates to all software components to minimize exposure to known vulnerabilities. 5. Regular Software Patching and Vulnerability Management: Implement a robust patch management program for all network devices and software, ensuring timely application of security updates. Conduct regular vulnerability scans and penetration tests to proactively identify and address security weaknesses.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing MFA for sensitive systems and computers, and conducting annual security awareness training. However, significant vulnerabilities exist, particularly the absence of MFA for email, a critical lack of an acceptable use policy, and no security awareness training for new employees. Additionally, an outdated web server poses a potential risk. Addressing these gaps is crucial to enhancing the overall security posture, reducing the attack surface, and protecting against common cyber threats. Proactive implementation of the recommended mitigations will significantly improve the organization's readiness against cyberattacks.</p>
