        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open port 8080 with a title indicating 'TOP SECRET DB'. While a provided risk assessment marked this as a false positive, the presence of such a title on an open port warrants attention. The organization currently employs Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and conducts security awareness training for both new and all employees annually, which are positive security practices. However, critical gaps exist in the security posture, including the absence of MFA for email access and sensitive data systems, and a lack of an employee acceptable use policy. These deficiencies significantly increase the organization's exposure to various cyber threats.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Port 8080 Secured (False Positive) - <span class="severity-Info">Info</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Port 8080 was identified as open during the network scan, displaying the title 'TOP SECRET DB'. However, a subsequent assessment indicated this as a false positive and confirmed the port as secure. Despite this, the presence of such a descriptive title on an open port could be misleading or indicate a misconfiguration if not properly secured.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of email account compromise through credential stuffing, phishing, or brute-force attacks. A compromised email account can serve as a gateway for attackers to gain further access to internal systems, sensitive information, or launch business email compromise (BEC) attacks.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee email accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Sensitive data systems within the organization do not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for login. This poses a critical risk, as a single compromised set of credentials could grant unauthorized users direct access to highly sensitive information, leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and severe reputational damage. The absence of this crucial security layer makes these systems highly vulnerable.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases storing sensitive information</li><li>Critical applications</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines on appropriate use of company IT resources, employees may unknowingly engage in risky behaviors such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive data. This increases the overall attack surface, makes it difficult to enforce security best practices, and can lead to accidental data exposure or malware infections.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee workstations</li><li>Network infrastructure</li><li>Company data</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and, critically, for all sensitive data systems. This will significantly enhance protection against credential-based attacks. Furthermore, the organization should develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy, clearly outlining expectations for IT resource usage and data handling. Regular security awareness training should reinforce these policies. While the 'TOP SECRET DB' on port 8080 was deemed a false positive, it is prudent to ensure proper labeling and access controls are in place for all publicly exposed services to avoid confusion and potential misinterpretation.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security through MFA for computer logins and regular security awareness training. However, the absence of MFA for email and sensitive data systems, coupled with the lack of an acceptable use policy, represents significant vulnerabilities that could lead to severe security incidents. Addressing these critical gaps is paramount to improving the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and protecting its valuable assets.</p>
