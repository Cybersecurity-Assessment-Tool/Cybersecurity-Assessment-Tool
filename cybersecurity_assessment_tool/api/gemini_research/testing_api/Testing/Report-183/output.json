            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network infrastructure includes an exposed MySQL database (version 5.7.33) accessible via port 3306. From an organizational security standpoint, while Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enforced for email and computer logins, it is notably absent for sensitive data systems. An acceptable use policy is established, however, there is a lack of security awareness training for both new hires and existing employees on an annual basis.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Database Exposure",
                        "Overview": "MySQL port 3306 is open to the network. This exposure allows potential attackers to attempt to access the database, which could lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. The vulnerability was identified through a network port scan revealing an open MySQL service.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Port 3306 (MySQL)"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement robust firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted IP addresses or internal networks. For long-term security, consider placing the database behind a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or implementing a more secure access control mechanism. Furthermore, the organization should immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access. Establishing mandatory security awareness training for all new employees and conducting annual refresher training for all staff is crucial to foster a security-conscious culture and reduce human-factor risks.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization demonstrates a foundational level of security with MFA for email and computer logins, but significant vulnerabilities remain. The exposed MySQL database presents a critical attack vector, and the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems, coupled with a complete lack of security awareness training, indicates a low overall readiness against common cyber threats. Addressing these gaps is paramount to improving the organization's security posture."
