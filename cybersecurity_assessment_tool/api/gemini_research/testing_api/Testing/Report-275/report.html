        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open SSH port (22) on an unspecified host. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is used for email access, it is not enforced for computer logins or sensitive data systems. The organization conducts security awareness training for new employees but lacks an acceptable use policy and annual security training for all staff.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Critical Service Exposure (SSH) - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH port (port 22) was identified during the network scan. This exposure allows potential attackers to attempt brute-force attacks, exploit SSH vulnerabilities, or gain unauthorized access if weak credentials are used. The high severity is due to the potential for complete system compromise and data exfiltration if access is gained. This was identified via Nmap scan data showing port 22 as open.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP address of exposed host</li><li>Port 22 (SSH service)</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and access to sensitive data systems. The organization should develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy and establish a program for annual security awareness training for all employees. Regarding the critical service exposure, immediate action should be taken to secure the open SSH port (22). This includes restricting access to trusted IP addresses, implementing strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., key-based authentication), disabling password authentication, ensuring SSH server software is up-to-date, and disabling the service if it is not essential.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant security risks, primarily due to critical service exposure (an open SSH port) and gaps in foundational security practices. While some security measures are in place, the absence of MFA for critical systems, an acceptable use policy, and regular security training leaves the organization vulnerable to unauthorized access and data breaches. Addressing these vulnerabilities is crucial for improving the overall security posture.</p>
