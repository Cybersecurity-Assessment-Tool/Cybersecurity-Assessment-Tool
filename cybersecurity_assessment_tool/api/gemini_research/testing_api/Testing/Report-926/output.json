            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network currently presents several critical security vulnerabilities. A network scan identified an outdated vsftpd 2.3.4 FTP server allowing anonymous login, posing a significant risk of unauthorized access and data exposure. Furthermore, the organization lacks fundamental security controls, including the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, which drastically increases the risk of credential compromise. Policy and training deficiencies are also prevalent, with no employee acceptable use policy or security awareness training for new or existing employees. Compounding these issues, a significant portion of workstations are running Windows 7, an end-of-life operating system, leaving them highly susceptible to known exploits and malware.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Anonymous FTP Access & Outdated FTP Server",
                        "Overview": "The FTP server (vsftpd 2.3.4) is configured to allow anonymous login, enabling unauthorized users to access, and potentially modify or exfiltrate, files without authentication. Additionally, vsftpd version 2.3.4 is an outdated software version with known vulnerabilities, making the server susceptible to various exploits, including backdoors and denial-of-service attacks. This was identified via an Nmap scan with the 'ftp-anon' script.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "FTP server (port 21)",
                            "vsftpd 2.3.4"

                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email, logging into computers, or accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access in the event of credential theft or compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or malware. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to critical organizational resources.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                    {
                        "Risk": "Absence of Security Policies and Training",
                        "Overview": "The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or annually for all employees. This absence of foundational security practices increases the likelihood of human error, successful social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing), and non-compliance with security best practices, making the organization more vulnerable to various cyber threats.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                    {
                        "Risk": "Outdated Windows Operating System",
                        "Overview": "Computers within the organization are running Windows 7, which is an end-of-life operating system. This means it no longer receives security updates, patches, or technical support from Microsoft. Consequently, these workstations are highly vulnerable to known exploits, malware, and zero-day attacks, posing a severe risk to data integrity, confidentiality, and system availability.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Workstations running Windows 7"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, immediate action is required across several fronts. Firstly, the outdated vsftpd FTP server should be updated to a current, supported version, and anonymous access must be disabled immediately. For enhanced security, consider replacing FTP with a more secure file transfer protocol like SFTP or FTPS. Secondly, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be implemented across all critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, to significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access from compromised credentials. Thirdly, foundational security hygiene must be established by developing and enforcing an employee acceptable use policy and implementing mandatory, regular security awareness training for all employees. Finally, all workstations running Windows 7 must be upgraded to a currently supported operating system (e.g., Windows 10 or 11) to ensure they receive critical security updates and patches.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces a critical cybersecurity posture due to a combination of outdated software, a severe lack of fundamental security controls (MFA, policies, training), and the continued use of end-of-life operating systems. These vulnerabilities collectively expose the organization to a high risk of data breaches, unauthorized access, and system compromise. Without immediate and comprehensive remediation, the organization's readiness to defend against modern cyber threats remains critically low, necessitating urgent strategic investment in security upgrades and employee education."
