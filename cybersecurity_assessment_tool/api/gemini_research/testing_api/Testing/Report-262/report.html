        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network was assessed, and while no technical vulnerabilities were identified through the provided scan data, several critical gaps in security policies and employee training were found. The organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and sensitive data systems, which is a positive step. However, the absence of MFA for email access and a complete lack of security awareness training for both new and existing employees represent significant areas of concern that could expose the organization to various cyber threats.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Email Security - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts if credentials are compromised through phishing or other means. Email accounts often contain sensitive information and can be used as a pivot point for further attacks, leading to data breaches or business email compromise. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on email access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee email accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Onboarding Security Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees are not provided with security awareness training upon joining the organization. This leaves new hires vulnerable to common social engineering attacks, phishing attempts, and unaware of organizational security policies and best practices from the start. This oversight increases the overall human risk factor and makes the organization more susceptible to initial compromise. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for security awareness training for new employees.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Ongoing Security Awareness - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. Regular training is crucial to keep employees informed about evolving threats, reinforce security best practices, and maintain a strong security culture. Without it, employees may forget previous training or be unaware of new attack vectors, increasing the likelihood of successful social engineering or malware attacks over time. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for annual security awareness training.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access. This will significantly enhance protection against credential theft and unauthorized access. Furthermore, a comprehensive security awareness training program should be established. This program must include mandatory training for all new employees during their onboarding process and annual refresher training for all existing employees. The training should cover topics such as phishing recognition, strong password practices, social engineering awareness, and adherence to the acceptable use policy. Regular training will foster a stronger security culture and reduce the likelihood of human-factor related incidents.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has some foundational security controls in place, such as MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, and an acceptable use policy, there are critical vulnerabilities related to email security and employee awareness training. The absence of MFA for email and the complete lack of security awareness training for both new and existing staff represent significant gaps that could be exploited by attackers. Addressing these policy and training deficiencies is paramount to improving the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and reducing its exposure to common and evolving cyber threats.</p>
