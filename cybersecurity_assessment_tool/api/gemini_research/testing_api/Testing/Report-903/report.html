        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes a MySQL database service (version 5.7.33) on port 3306, making it accessible from the network. Furthermore, the organization exhibits significant deficiencies in its security posture regarding access control and foundational security policies. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is not required for critical access points such as email, computer logins, or sensitive data systems. There is also an absence of an employee acceptable use policy and no regular security awareness training for new or existing employees, indicating a substantial reliance on unguided employee behavior for security.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network. This exposes the database service to potential unauthorized access and attacks, especially if not properly secured with strong credentials and access controls. The identified version is MySQL 5.7.33, which may contain known vulnerabilities if not regularly patched.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li><li>MySQL 5.7.33 service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for email access, computer logins, or sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to critical systems, leading to data breaches, system compromise, and significant operational disruption.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email access</li><li>Computer logins</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This means there are no formal guidelines for employees regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, data, and internet access. This can lead to misuse of company assets, increased risk of data breaches due to inappropriate data handling, and potential legal liabilities arising from unmanaged employee behavior.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee behavior</li><li>IT resource usage</li><li>Data handling practices</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or annual training for all employees. This leaves employees vulnerable to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) and unaware of best practices for data protection, password hygiene, and identifying suspicious activities. Human error is a leading cause of security incidents, and the lack of training significantly exacerbates this risk, making the organization susceptible to various attacks that exploit human vulnerabilities.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li><li>Data protection practices</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, the organization should immediately implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306 to only authorized internal IP addresses or services. For long-term security, consider placing the database behind a VPN or within a segmented network accessible only via secure channels. Crucially, multi-factor authentication (MFA) must be implemented across all critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, to significantly enhance credential security. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to guide appropriate behavior regarding IT resources and data. Furthermore, establish and regularly conduct mandatory security awareness training for all employees, including new hires and annual refreshers, to educate them on cybersecurity best practices and threat identification.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The current cybersecurity assessment reveals a critical state of readiness for the organization. Key vulnerabilities include an exposed MySQL database service and, more significantly, a complete absence of multi-factor authentication for critical access points. These technical weaknesses are compounded by fundamental gaps in security policies and employee training, specifically the lack of an acceptable use policy and any form of security awareness training. Without immediate and comprehensive remediation efforts, the organization remains highly susceptible to unauthorized access, data breaches, and various cyberattacks that could lead to significant operational, financial, and reputational damage.</p>
