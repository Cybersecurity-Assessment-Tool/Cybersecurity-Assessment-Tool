        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open SSH port (22), indicating potential remote access capabilities. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is utilized for email access, it is notably absent for computer logins and sensitive data systems, representing a significant security gap. Furthermore, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct security awareness training for new or existing employees, suggesting a low level of security maturity in terms of user education and policy enforcement.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A critical vulnerability was identified where internal services, potentially including sensitive data or administrative interfaces, are exposed to an untrusted network segment. This exposure, indicated by a CVSS score of 10.0, allows unauthorized access to internal resources, leading to potential data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service. The specific mechanism of exposure was identified through network scanning, revealing an accessible internal IP address.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Internal IP Address</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is critical to immediately implement strict firewall rules and review network segmentation to prevent unauthorized access to internal services, particularly those identified as 'Localhost Exposed'. For any services requiring external access, robust authentication and authorization mechanisms must be deployed. Furthermore, the organization should prioritize implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and sensitive data systems to enhance access control. A comprehensive employee acceptable use policy needs to be developed and enforced. Finally, mandatory security awareness training for all new employees and annual refresher training for all staff should be established to cultivate a security-conscious culture and reduce human-factor risks.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In conclusion, the organization faces critical security vulnerabilities, primarily stemming from an exposed internal service and significant gaps in its security posture related to access control and employee education. The absence of MFA for critical systems, lack of an acceptable use policy, and no security awareness training collectively indicate a low level of readiness against modern cyber threats. Addressing these issues through technical controls and policy implementation is paramount to improving the organization's overall cybersecurity resilience.</p>
