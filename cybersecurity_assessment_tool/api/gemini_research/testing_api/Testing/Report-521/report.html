        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) port (3389), which is a significant security concern. Internally, while Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is used for computer logins, it is notably absent for email access and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct security awareness training for new employees, although annual training is provided for existing staff.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>RDP Exposure - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed to the internet, allowing potential attackers to attempt brute-force attacks or exploit RDP vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to internal systems. This was identified through a network scan showing port 3389 as open.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP Address of the RDP server</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately close the exposed RDP port (3389) to the internet. For remote access, implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution with strong authentication. Furthermore, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) should be implemented for all email access and sensitive data systems to significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access. The organization should also develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy and establish mandatory security awareness training for all new employees, in addition to the existing annual training for all staff.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In conclusion, the organization faces critical security vulnerabilities primarily due to an exposed RDP service and significant gaps in MFA implementation for email and sensitive data systems. The absence of an acceptable use policy and new employee security training further exacerbates the risk posture. While annual security training is a positive step, addressing these critical technical and policy deficiencies is paramount to enhancing the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and protecting against potential breaches.</p>
