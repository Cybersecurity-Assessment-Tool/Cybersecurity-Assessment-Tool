        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an active host with an open HTTPS service (port 443) running Nginx version 1.18.0. While the organization requires MFA for computer logins and conducts annual security awareness training for all employees, significant gaps exist in its security posture. Specifically, MFA is not mandated for email access or sensitive data systems, and new employees do not receive immediate security awareness training. The use of an outdated Nginx web server also presents a critical vulnerability.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access through credential stuffing, phishing, or brute-force attacks. A compromised email account can serve as a gateway for business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and further internal network penetration. This vulnerability was identified through the organization's self-reported security practices.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>User email accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Access to systems containing sensitive data is not protected by Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if user credentials are stolen, guessed, or compromised through other means. A breach of these systems could lead to severe data loss, regulatory non-compliance, financial penalties, and significant reputational damage. This vulnerability was identified through the organization's self-reported security practices.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not provide security awareness training specifically for new employees upon onboarding. New hires are often the most susceptible to social engineering tactics, such as phishing and pretexting, due to unfamiliarity with organizational security policies and common threat vectors. This oversight creates an initial point of vulnerability that attackers can exploit to gain unauthorized access or introduce malware. This vulnerability was identified through the organization's self-reported security practices.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Web Server Software (Nginx) - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nginx web server identified on port 443 is running version 1.18.0. This version was released in April 2020 and is no longer actively maintained or receiving security updates. Outdated software is prone to known vulnerabilities (CVEs) that can be exploited by attackers for various malicious purposes, including remote code execution, denial-of-service attacks, or unauthorized information disclosure. Running an unsupported version significantly increases the attack surface and risk of compromise. This vulnerability was identified via network scan data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Web server (Nginx 1.18.0)</li><li>Web application hosted on Nginx</li><li>Port 443</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access. A mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees should be established and completed during their onboarding process to educate them on common threats and internal security protocols. Furthermore, the Nginx web server should be updated to the latest stable and supported version to patch known vulnerabilities and ensure ongoing security updates. Regular software patching and vulnerability management should become a standard operational procedure across all systems.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several significant cybersecurity risks, primarily stemming from a lack of comprehensive MFA implementation for critical services like email and sensitive data systems, an absence of initial security awareness training for new employees, and the use of outdated web server software. While some security measures are in place, these identified vulnerabilities represent considerable gaps that could be exploited by malicious actors. Addressing these issues promptly is crucial to enhancing the organization's overall security posture and readiness against cyber threats.</p>
