        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and sensitive data systems, maintaining an employee acceptable use policy, and conducting annual security awareness training for all employees. However, critical gaps exist, specifically the lack of MFA for email access and the absence of security awareness training for new employees. While network scans indicate port 80 is currently closed, a potential vulnerability related to an unencrypted web server was identified, suggesting a need for vigilance regarding web service configurations.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unencrypted Web Server - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An unencrypted web server was identified as a potential risk, with port 80 potentially configured for unencrypted HTTP traffic. Although current scans show port 80 as closed, the identification of this risk suggests a past or potential configuration that would allow for unencrypted data transmission. If active, this would make any data transmitted vulnerable to interception and eavesdropping, posing a risk of data exposure and compromise of user privacy. This was identified through a review of potential system configurations.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through various attack vectors such as phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. A compromised email account can serve as a gateway for attackers to launch further attacks, access sensitive information, or impersonate employees, leading to severe business disruption and data breaches. This was identified through an assessment of organizational security policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee Email Accounts</li><li>Email System</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive dedicated security awareness training upon onboarding. This leaves them vulnerable to common social engineering tactics, phishing attempts, and other cybersecurity threats from their first day. A lack of initial training can lead to inadvertent security breaches, data leaks, or the introduction of malware into the network, as new hires may not be aware of organizational security policies and best practices. This was identified through an assessment of employee onboarding procedures.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New Employees</li><li>Organizational Security Posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all employee email accounts immediately. For the unencrypted web server risk, ensure that port 80 remains closed if no HTTP service is intended. If an HTTP service is required, implement HTTPS by obtaining and configuring an SSL/TLS certificate to encrypt all web traffic, protecting data in transit. Furthermore, establish a mandatory security awareness training program for all new hires as part of their onboarding process, covering common threats, organizational policies, and best practices. Regularly review and update security policies and conduct periodic vulnerability assessments and penetration testing to identify and remediate new risks proactively.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization exhibits a mixed security posture, with commendable efforts in securing computer logins and sensitive data systems with MFA, alongside an acceptable use policy and annual security training. However, the absence of MFA for email and initial security training for new employees represents significant vulnerabilities that could be exploited. Addressing these critical gaps, along with ensuring secure web server configurations, is paramount to enhancing the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and resilience against evolving threats.</p>
