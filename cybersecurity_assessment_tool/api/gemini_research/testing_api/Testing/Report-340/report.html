        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The network scan data indicates no immediately apparent open ports or network-level vulnerabilities, suggesting a basic level of network perimeter hygiene. However, an assessment of the organizational security posture reveals critical gaps in foundational security practices. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for computer logins and sensitive data systems, it is notably absent for email access. Furthermore, security awareness training, though provided to new employees, is not conducted annually for the entire workforce, leaving the organization vulnerable to evolving human-centric threats.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Email Security - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. Compromised email accounts can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and further internal network penetration. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'Do you require MFA to access email?':'No'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li><li>Organizational data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Ongoing Security Awareness - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This leaves the workforce susceptible to evolving social engineering tactics, phishing attempts, and general cybersecurity threats. Without regular refreshers, employees may forget best practices, increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'Does your organization do security awareness training for all employees at least once per year?':'No'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network security</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access. This critical step will significantly reduce the risk of email account compromise. Additionally, a comprehensive and mandatory annual security awareness training program should be established for all employees to ensure continuous education on current threats, phishing recognition, and secure computing practices. Regular training will empower employees to be the first line of defense against social engineering attacks.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently exhibits a mixed state of cybersecurity readiness. While basic network scanning did not reveal immediate external vulnerabilities and some MFA is in place, the lack of MFA for email and the absence of annual security awareness training represent significant, high-impact risks. Addressing these human and access control vulnerabilities is paramount to improving the overall security posture and reducing the likelihood of successful cyberattacks.</p>
