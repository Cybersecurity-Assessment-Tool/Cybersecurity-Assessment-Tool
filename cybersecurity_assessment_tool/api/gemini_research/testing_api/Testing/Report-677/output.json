                "Summary": "The organization's network scan revealed an open RDP port (3389), indicating potential external exposure. Internally, while Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is used for computer logins and sensitive data systems, it is not enforced for email access. Furthermore, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct security awareness training for new or existing employees, highlighting significant gaps in foundational security practices.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "RDP Exposure",
                        "Overview": "Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed externally on port 3389. This allows potential attackers to attempt brute-force attacks or exploit vulnerabilities in the RDP service to gain unauthorized access to internal systems. The impact could range from unauthorized access to data exfiltration or system compromise. This was identified via a network scan showing an open RDP port.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Email",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing or credential stuffing attacks. If an attacker gains access to an employee's email, it can lead to further attacks, data breaches, or impersonation. This was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Email system",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy",
                        "Overview": "The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines, employees may engage in activities that inadvertently introduce security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling company data. This increases the likelihood of malware infections, data loss, and compliance issues. This was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Organizational policies",

                    {
                        "Risk": "No Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or annually for all employees. This leaves employees vulnerable to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) and unaware of best practices for data protection and incident reporting. Human error is a leading cause of security breaches, and a lack of training exacerbates this risk. This was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Employees",
                            "Organizational security posture"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "Immediate action should be taken to mitigate the critical RDP exposure by closing port 3389 externally and implementing a VPN for secure remote access. Furthermore, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be enforced for all email accounts to prevent unauthorized access. The organization should develop and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to guide employee behavior and reduce internal risks. Crucially, a robust security awareness training program should be established for all new hires and conducted annually for all employees to educate them on current threats and best security practices.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks, primarily due to an externally exposed RDP service and critical gaps in foundational security practices. The absence of MFA for email, an acceptable use policy, and regular security awareness training leaves the organization highly vulnerable to various attack vectors, including external exploitation, account compromise, and social engineering. While MFA is in place for computer logins and sensitive data, these strengths are overshadowed by the identified weaknesses, indicating a low overall security readiness. Addressing these vulnerabilities is paramount to improving the organization's security posture and protecting its assets."
