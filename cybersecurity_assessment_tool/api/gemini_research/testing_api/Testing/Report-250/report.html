        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network environment, based on the provided data, indicates a foundational reliance on basic security measures, particularly regarding access control and employee awareness. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for email and sensitive data systems, a significant gap exists in its application for computer logins. Furthermore, critical elements of a robust security culture, such as an acceptable use policy and comprehensive security awareness training for both new and existing employees, are currently absent. No technical vulnerabilities were identified through network scans, suggesting the primary risks lie within policy and human factors.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Authentication for Workstations - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee workstations</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This means there are no formal guidelines for employees regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, data, and internet access. This can lead to misuse of resources, increased risk of data breaches, and legal liabilities. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Organizational data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Onboarding Security Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training. This leaves new hires vulnerable to social engineering attacks (phishing, pretexting) and unaware of organizational security best practices, potentially introducing new vectors for attacks. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Ongoing Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This results in a stale understanding of current threats, evolving attack techniques, and updated security policies among staff, making them more susceptible to social engineering and other human-centric attacks. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization implement Multi-Factor Authentication for all computer logins to enhance endpoint security and prevent unauthorized access from compromised credentials. A comprehensive employee acceptable use policy should be developed and enforced to clearly define guidelines for IT resource usage, thereby reducing misuse and potential data exposure. Furthermore, a mandatory security awareness training program must be established, including initial training for all new employees and annual refresher training for all staff. These training programs should cover topics such as phishing, social engineering, password hygiene, and data handling best practices to cultivate a strong security-conscious culture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently exhibits a mixed security posture. While critical systems like email and sensitive data access benefit from MFA, the absence of MFA for computer logins represents a significant vulnerability. More critically, the lack of an acceptable use policy and comprehensive, ongoing security awareness training for all employees indicates a substantial gap in the organization's human firewall and overall security culture. Addressing these policy and training deficiencies is paramount to improving the organization's readiness against common cyber threats and reducing the likelihood of successful social engineering attacks and internal misuse.</p>
