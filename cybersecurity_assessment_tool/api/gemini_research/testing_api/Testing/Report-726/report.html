        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's security posture presents a blend of established controls and notable vulnerabilities. While an acceptable use policy is in effect and annual security awareness training is provided to all employees, along with multi-factor authentication (MFA) for computer logins, critical security gaps remain. These include the absence of MFA for email access and sensitive data systems, and a lack of initial security awareness training for new employees. Although a limited network scan indicated port 80 as closed on a host, a separate assessment identified an unencrypted web server, suggesting potential inconsistencies or a broader network scope not fully covered by the provided scan data.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unencrypted Web Server - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An unencrypted web server was identified, exposing potential data in transit to interception. This risk was identified through a vulnerability assessment, despite a limited network scan indicating port 80 as closed. The presence of an unencrypted web server can lead to sensitive information disclosure and compromise user privacy.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To enhance the organization's security posture, several key recommendations are provided. Firstly, address the identified unencrypted web server by either closing port 80 if it is not intended for public access, or by implementing SSL/TLS encryption for all web traffic if a web service is required. Secondly, immediately implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and sensitive data systems to significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access. Thirdly, establish a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees to ensure they are equipped with foundational security knowledge from day one. Finally, regularly review and update the employee acceptable use policy and conduct periodic security audits to identify and mitigate emerging threats.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In conclusion, the organization exhibits a foundational understanding of cybersecurity with existing policies and training, but its readiness is significantly hampered by critical vulnerabilities and policy gaps. The lack of MFA for email and sensitive data, coupled with the absence of new employee security training and the presence of an unencrypted web server, represents considerable attack vectors. Addressing these issues proactively is crucial for strengthening the overall security posture and protecting organizational assets from potential cyber threats.</p>
