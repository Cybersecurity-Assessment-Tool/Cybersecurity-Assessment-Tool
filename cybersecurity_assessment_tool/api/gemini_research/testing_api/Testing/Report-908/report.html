        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open port 80, indicating a potential web service exposure. Internally, the organization has some foundational security practices, including an acceptable use policy and annual security awareness training for all employees. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is implemented for sensitive data systems, which is a positive step. However, critical gaps exist, particularly the absence of MFA for email and computer logins, and a lack of security awareness training for new employees. These deficiencies significantly increase the organization's attack surface and susceptibility to common cyber threats.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for email access. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks. If an attacker gains access to an employee's email, they could launch further attacks, impersonate the employee, or access sensitive information, leading to data breaches or financial loss.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>All employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for logging into computers. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or guessed. An attacker gaining access to a computer could potentially access internal networks, sensitive data, deploy malware, or move laterally within the network, escalating the impact of a breach.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers</li><li>Internal network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open Port 80 (HTTP) Exposure - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A web server is exposed on port 80 (HTTP). While this is common for web services, it represents a potential attack surface. Without knowing the specific service, it could be vulnerable to web application attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, directory traversal), or the underlying web server software might be outdated and contain known vulnerabilities. Unencrypted HTTP traffic also poses a risk for data interception if sensitive information is transmitted.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Network perimeter</li><li>Web server on port 80</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often less familiar with organizational security policies and common threats, making them prime targets for social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting). This oversight increases the likelihood of successful attacks leveraging human factors, potentially leading to initial access for attackers.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Overall organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and computer logins across the organization. This single measure will significantly enhance protection against credential theft and unauthorized access. For the exposed port 80, a thorough assessment of the hosted web service is crucial to identify and patch any vulnerabilities, ensure the use of HTTPS for all traffic, and consider restricting access if the service is not intended for public use. Furthermore, establishing a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees upon onboarding is essential to educate them on current threats and organizational security policies from day one, complementing the existing annual training.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of cybersecurity with an acceptable use policy and annual security training. However, critical vulnerabilities related to MFA implementation for email and computer access, coupled with an exposed web service and a gap in new employee security training, indicate a moderate to high-risk posture. Addressing these key areas will significantly improve the organization's overall security readiness and resilience against common cyber threats.</p>
