        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The network scan identified an open port 8080 with the HTTP title 'TOP SECRET DB', indicating a critical exposure of a potentially sensitive database interface. Organizational data reveals that while Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is used for email and computer logins, it is not required for accessing sensitive data systems. Additionally, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Security awareness training is conducted for both new and existing employees annually, which is a positive aspect of the human factor security.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed Sensitive Database Interface - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An Nmap scan revealed an open port 8080 with an HTTP title 'TOP SECRET DB'. This indicates that a potentially sensitive database interface is directly exposed to the network, which could allow unauthorized access to critical data. The explicit mention of 'TOP SECRET DB' in the title highlights the severe confidentiality implications if this system is compromised.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li><li>System hosting 'TOP SECRET DB'</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if user credentials are compromised, as a single factor (password) is insufficient to provide robust protection against modern cyber threats.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User authentication mechanisms</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks an employee acceptable use policy (AUP). Without a formal AUP, employees may not be fully aware of their responsibilities regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, data handling, and security protocols. This gap can lead to increased risks of misuse, data leakage, and non-compliance, creating a significant governance and human factor vulnerability.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Organizational policies</li><li>Employee behavior</li><li>IT resource usage</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediate action is required to secure the exposed 'TOP SECRET DB' interface on port 8080; it should be removed from direct network exposure, placed behind a robust firewall, and protected with strong authentication and access controls. Furthermore, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be implemented across all sensitive data systems to significantly enhance protection against unauthorized access. The organization should also develop, implement, and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy (AUP) to clearly define employee responsibilities and expectations regarding IT resource usage and data security. Regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing are recommended to proactively identify and remediate further security weaknesses.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization faces critical and high-severity vulnerabilities primarily due to an exposed sensitive database interface and the absence of crucial security controls such as MFA for sensitive data systems and a formal acceptable use policy. While security awareness training is a positive step, these fundamental gaps severely compromise the organization's overall security posture and readiness against cyber threats. Addressing these identified risks promptly is paramount to safeguard sensitive information and mitigate the potential for a significant data breach.</p>
