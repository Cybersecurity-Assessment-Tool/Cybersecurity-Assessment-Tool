        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan data indicates that port 80 is closed, however, an unencrypted web server vulnerability has been identified. The organization currently lacks multi-factor authentication for email and computer logins, which are critical access points. An acceptable use policy is not in place, and annual security awareness training for all employees is not conducted, indicating gaps in foundational security practices. While new employees receive security awareness training and MFA is used for sensitive data systems, these measures are not comprehensive across the organization.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unencrypted Web Server - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Port 80 is open, exposing an unencrypted web server. This allows for data interception and potential compromise of information transmitted over the network. This vulnerability was identified through a security assessment.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate identified risks and improve overall security posture, it is recommended to implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all email and computer login access. The unencrypted web server on Port 80 should be secured, ideally by implementing SSL/TLS encryption, or by closing the port if it's not intended for public access. Furthermore, the organization should develop and enforce an employee acceptable use policy and establish a program for mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees to foster a strong security culture and reduce human-related risks.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several security challenges, including an unencrypted web server and significant gaps in multi-factor authentication implementation for critical access points like email and computer logins. The absence of an acceptable use policy and annual security awareness training for all employees further exacerbates the risk profile. While some security measures are in place, such as MFA for sensitive data systems and training for new employees, the overall readiness is compromised by these fundamental deficiencies, leaving the organization vulnerable to various cyber threats. Addressing these areas is crucial for enhancing the organization's cybersecurity posture.</p>
