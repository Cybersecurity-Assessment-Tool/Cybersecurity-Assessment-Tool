        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network, based on the provided Nmap scan, shows a single host online with port 80 identified as closed. No other open ports were detected. From an organizational policy perspective, the company demonstrates strengths in requiring Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and conducting regular security awareness training for both new and existing employees. However, significant vulnerabilities exist due to the absence of MFA for email access and sensitive data systems, as well as the lack of an employee acceptable use policy.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts if credentials are compromised, potentially leading to phishing attacks, data breaches, and business email compromise (BEC). This vulnerability was identified through a review of organizational security policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to log into sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are stolen or guessed, increasing the risk of data exfiltration, tampering, or destruction. This vulnerability was identified through a review of organizational security policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy (AUP). Without a clear AUP, employees may be unaware of their responsibilities regarding company IT resources, data handling, and internet usage, leading to potential misuse, security incidents, and compliance violations. This vulnerability was identified through a review of organizational security policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>IT systems</li><li>Data handling procedures</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and for all sensitive data systems. This will significantly enhance account security and protect critical information. Furthermore, the organization should develop, disseminate, and enforce a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy to clearly define expected behavior regarding IT resource usage and data handling. While the organization currently conducts security awareness training, it should continue these efforts and ensure the new policies are integrated into the training curriculum. Regular reviews of security policies and their enforcement are also advised.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security through its use of MFA for computer logins and consistent security awareness training. However, critical gaps exist in the protection of email and sensitive data systems due to the absence of MFA, and a lack of a formal acceptable use policy introduces operational risks. Addressing these key vulnerabilities is paramount to improving the overall security posture and readiness against modern cyber threats.</p>
