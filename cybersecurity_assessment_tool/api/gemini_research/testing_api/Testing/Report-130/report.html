        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for sensitive data systems and providing initial security awareness training for new employees. However, significant vulnerabilities exist due to the lack of MFA for email and computer logins, the absence of an employee acceptable use policy, and the failure to conduct annual security awareness training for all staff. The provided network scan data did not reveal specific network-level vulnerabilities, suggesting the current risks are primarily policy and access control related.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for accessing employee email accounts. This significantly elevates the risk of unauthorized access to email through credential theft, phishing, or brute-force attacks. A compromised email account can serve as a gateway for further attacks, including business email compromise (BEC) and data exfiltration.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee email accounts</li><li>Email servers/services</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not mandate MFA for logging into computers. This exposes endpoints to unauthorized access if user credentials are stolen or guessed, potentially enabling attackers to gain initial access, move laterally within the network, deploy malware, or exfiltrate sensitive data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee workstations</li><li>Servers requiring direct login</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. Without a clear AUP, employees may not fully understand their responsibilities regarding the use of company IT resources, data handling, and internet browsing. This can lead to increased risks of data leakage, malware infections, and non-compliance with regulatory requirements due to inappropriate or insecure employee behavior.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Organizational data assets</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Recurring Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive initial security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual training for all employees. This practice leaves the workforce susceptible to evolving cyber threats, as employees may not be updated on the latest phishing techniques, social engineering tactics, or company security policies. Human error remains a significant factor in security incidents.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all email accounts and computer logins. Furthermore, develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to clearly define expectations for IT resource usage and data handling. Establish a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees to ensure continuous education on current threats, best practices, and policy updates. Regularly review and update security policies and training content to adapt to the evolving threat landscape and maintain a proactive defense.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several critical security vulnerabilities, primarily stemming from insufficient implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication and gaps in foundational security policies and training. While some positive security measures are in place, the absence of MFA for key access points, a formal acceptable use policy, and recurring security awareness training leaves the organization exposed to common and impactful attack vectors. Addressing these identified risks is paramount to improving overall cybersecurity readiness and mitigating the potential for significant security incidents.</p>
