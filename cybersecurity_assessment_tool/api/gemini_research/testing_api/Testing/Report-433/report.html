        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The network scan identified a single open port, 443, running Nginx version 1.18.0, indicating a web server is operational. From an organizational standpoint, the company demonstrates strong adherence to multi-factor authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. An employee acceptable use policy is also in place, and annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees. However, a critical gap was identified: new employees do not receive security awareness training upon onboarding.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of New Employee Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently does not provide security awareness training to new employees. This poses a significant risk as new hires may not be aware of the organization's specific security policies, common social engineering tactics (e.g., phishing, pretexting), or best practices for handling sensitive information. This lack of initial training increases the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents, data breaches, or successful phishing attacks, potentially compromising the organization's systems and data. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>Organizational data and systems</li><li>Overall security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>It is strongly recommended that the organization implement mandatory security awareness training for all new employees as part of their onboarding process. This training should cover essential topics such as phishing recognition, password hygiene, data handling policies, acceptable use of company resources, and incident reporting procedures. Regular, interactive training sessions, coupled with simulated phishing exercises, will help reinforce these concepts and build a stronger security culture from day one. Additionally, ensure that the Nginx server on port 443 is kept up-to-date with the latest security patches to mitigate any potential vulnerabilities in the web server software.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization exhibits a commendable commitment to security through its widespread use of MFA and annual security training. However, the absence of security awareness training for new employees represents a critical vulnerability that could undermine these existing controls. Addressing this gap by implementing comprehensive onboarding security training is paramount to enhancing the organization's overall readiness against human-factor risks and maintaining a robust security posture.</p>
