        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed at least one host with an open SSH port (22). While SSH is a secure protocol, an exposed port can be a target for various attacks if not properly secured. Furthermore, the organization currently lacks critical security controls, specifically Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and sensitive data systems. There is also a significant gap in employee security awareness, as no regular training is conducted for new or existing employees. Although an acceptable use policy is in place, its effectiveness is limited without accompanying training and enforcement.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unsecured SSH Access - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH port (22) was identified on a host within the network. While SSH is a secure protocol, an exposed port can be a target for brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or exploitation of unpatched SSH server vulnerabilities if not properly secured (e.g., with strong passwords, key-based authentication, rate limiting, and up-to-date software). This could lead to unauthorized access to the system.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host(s) with open port 22</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of email account compromise through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks. Compromised email accounts can lead to business email compromise (BEC) scams, data exfiltration, and further lateral movement within the network.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee email accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to log into sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk, as a single compromised credential could grant an attacker direct access to confidential information, leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and severe reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Increased Susceptibility to Social Engineering - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or for all employees at least once per year. This leaves employees vulnerable to social engineering attacks, phishing, malware, and other human-centric threats. A lack of awareness can lead to employees inadvertently compromising systems or data, acting as an easy entry point for attackers.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement strong security measures for SSH, including using key-based authentication, disabling password authentication where possible, implementing rate limiting, ensuring SSH servers are patched, and restricting access to trusted IPs. Mandate and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and sensitive data systems. Establish a comprehensive security awareness training program for all new employees and conduct mandatory refresher training for all employees at least annually. This training should cover phishing, social engineering, password hygiene, and data handling best practices. Finally, ensure the existing acceptable use policy is regularly reviewed, communicated, and enforced.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to critical gaps in access control mechanisms (lack of MFA for email and sensitive data systems) and human-factor vulnerabilities (absence of regular security awareness training). The presence of an open SSH port also presents a potential entry point if not properly secured. While an acceptable use policy is in place, its effectiveness is diminished without accompanying training. Addressing these fundamental issues is crucial to improving the overall security posture and reducing the likelihood of a successful cyberattack or data breach.</p>
