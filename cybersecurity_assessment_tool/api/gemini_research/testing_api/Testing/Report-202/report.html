        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's current security posture reveals critical gaps primarily in its policy and training frameworks, rather than immediate technical vulnerabilities identified through network scans, which were empty. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is utilized for email access, it is notably absent for computer logins and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization lacks fundamental security controls such as an employee acceptable use policy and comprehensive security awareness training for both new hires and existing employees on an annual basis. These deficiencies indicate a significant reliance on single-factor authentication for critical access points and a potential for human-factor risks due to a lack of defined security behaviors and ongoing education.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for employees to log into their computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised through phishing, malware, or brute-force attacks. Without a second factor, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's workstation and potentially the internal network.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Internal network access</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk, as compromised credentials could allow unauthorized individuals direct access to confidential information, leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and severe reputational damage. The absence of MFA on these critical systems makes them a prime target for attackers.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Confidential information</li><li>Organizational data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not have an employee acceptable use policy (AUP). An AUP is crucial for defining the proper and acceptable use of company IT resources, including computers, networks, and data. Without clear guidelines, employees may inadvertently engage in risky behaviors, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or misusing company assets, increasing the attack surface and potential for security incidents.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often unfamiliar with an organization's specific security protocols, threats, and best practices. This lack of initial training leaves them vulnerable to common social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) and increases the likelihood of them making security mistakes, thereby exposing the organization to risks from day one.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li><li>Susceptibility to social engineering</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not provide annual security awareness training for all employees. Regular training is essential to keep employees informed about evolving threats, reinforce security best practices, and maintain a strong security culture. Without ongoing education, employees may forget previous training, become complacent, or fail to recognize new attack vectors, making the organization more susceptible to human-factor risks.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li><li>Susceptibility to evolving threats</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and access to sensitive data systems. This critical step will add a vital layer of defense against credential theft. Concurrently, the organization must develop and enforce an employee acceptable use policy to clearly define expected behavior regarding IT resource usage. Furthermore, establishing comprehensive security awareness training programs is paramount. This includes mandatory training for all new employees upon onboarding and annual refresher training for all staff to ensure continuous education on current threats and best practices. These measures will collectively reduce the risk of unauthorized access, human error, and policy violations.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently exhibits significant vulnerabilities primarily stemming from gaps in its security policies and employee training programs, despite having MFA for email. The absence of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, coupled with a lack of an acceptable use policy and both initial and recurring security awareness training, exposes the organization to a high risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and human-factor security incidents. Addressing these foundational security posture weaknesses is crucial for improving overall readiness against cyber threats.</p>
