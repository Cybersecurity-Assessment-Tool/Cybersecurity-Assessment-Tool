            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and computer logins, and by having an employee acceptable use policy. New employees also receive security awareness training. However, critical gaps exist, including the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems and a lack of annual security awareness training for all employees. A network scan also revealed an open SSH port (port 22), which, if not properly secured, could pose a risk for unauthorized remote access.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or other means. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to sensitive data, leading to potential data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and reputational damage. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'Do you require MFA to access sensitive data systems?': 'No'.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Inadequate Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. While new employees receive training, the lack of recurring training leaves the workforce vulnerable to evolving social engineering tactics, phishing attempts, and other human-centric attacks. Employees may not be up-to-date on the latest threats, increasing the likelihood of successful attacks that could lead to data breaches, malware infections, or credential compromise. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'Does your organization do security awareness training for all employees at least once per year?': 'No'.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Open SSH Port (Port 22)",
                        "Overview": "A network scan identified an open SSH (Secure Shell) port (port 22). While SSH is a legitimate protocol for secure remote access, an open port presents a potential attack surface if not properly secured. Without strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., key-based authentication, MFA), robust access controls, and regular patching, this port could be exploited by attackers attempting brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or exploiting SSH vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized remote access to the system. This was identified through the network scan data showing an open port 22.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "System with open port 22",
                            "Network perimeter"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access even if primary credentials are compromised. Furthermore, a comprehensive and mandatory annual security awareness training program should be established for all employees to ensure they are continuously updated on the latest cyber threats and best practices. Regarding the open SSH port (port 22), a thorough review of its configuration is necessary. This should include restricting access to only authorized IP addresses, enforcing strong authentication methods such as key-based authentication (disabling password authentication where possible), implementing rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks, and ensuring the SSH server software is regularly patched and configured securely.",
            "Conclusion": "While the organization has taken positive steps in implementing MFA for email and computer logins, and providing initial security awareness training, significant vulnerabilities remain. The absence of MFA for sensitive data systems, the lack of ongoing security awareness training, and the presence of an open SSH port collectively indicate a moderate to high-risk posture. Addressing these critical areas will substantially enhance the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and reduce its susceptibility to common attack vectors."
