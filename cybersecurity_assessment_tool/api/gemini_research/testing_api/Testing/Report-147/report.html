        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes a MySQL database port (3306) to the network, indicating a potential direct attack vector. While the organization requires MFA for email and computer logins, a critical gap exists as MFA is not mandated for accessing sensitive data systems. Furthermore, there is a significant deficiency in security awareness training, with no programs for new employees or annual refreshers for all staff. This combination of technical exposure and human factor vulnerabilities suggests a moderate to high-risk security posture.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network. This exposes the database to potential unauthorized access, data breaches, and denial-of-service attacks if not properly secured. This vulnerability was identified via an Nmap scan showing open port 3306.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical data if credentials are compromised, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication. This was identified from organizational policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive Data Systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of New Employee Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. This leaves new hires vulnerable to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) and unaware of organizational security policies and best practices, potentially introducing human error vulnerabilities from day one. This was identified from organizational policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New Employees</li><li>Organizational Security Posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. This results in employees potentially forgetting best practices, not being updated on new threats, and a general degradation of the human firewall over time, increasing susceptibility to various cyberattacks. This was identified from organizational policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All Employees</li><li>Organizational Security Posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from authorized internal IP addresses or secure bastion hosts. For long-term security, consider placing the database behind a VPN. Furthermore, mandate Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to significantly enhance protection against credential theft. Crucially, establish a comprehensive security awareness training program for all new employees upon onboarding and implement mandatory annual security awareness training for all staff to foster a strong security culture and educate employees on current threats and best practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks stemming from an exposed database service, a lack of MFA for sensitive data access, and a complete absence of regular security awareness training for its workforce. While MFA is in place for email and computer logins, these critical gaps leave the organization vulnerable to data breaches, unauthorized access, and social engineering attacks. Addressing these vulnerabilities through technical controls and robust employee education is paramount to improving the overall security posture and readiness.</p>
