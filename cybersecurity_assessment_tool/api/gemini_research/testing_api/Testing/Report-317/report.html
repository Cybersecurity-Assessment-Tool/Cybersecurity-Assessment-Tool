        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization has implemented multi-factor authentication (MFA) for critical access points including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, indicating a strong foundational security measure. An acceptable use policy is in place, and annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees. However, a significant vulnerability has been identified: an open Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) port (3389) on the network, which exposes internal systems to potential external threats. Additionally, there is a gap in security awareness training for new employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>RDP Exposure - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed to the internet via an open port (3389). This allows external attackers to attempt to gain unauthorized access to internal systems, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or ransomware attacks. This was identified through network scanning which revealed port 3389 as open and accessible.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP address with open port 3389</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediately close port 3389 to prevent external RDP access. For legitimate remote access needs, implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution to secure connections, ensuring all RDP traffic is tunneled through the VPN. Furthermore, it is recommended to implement comprehensive security awareness training for all new employees to ensure they are aware of cybersecurity best practices and organizational policies from day one, complementing the existing annual training for all staff.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a commendable commitment to security through its widespread use of MFA and consistent annual security awareness training. However, the critical vulnerability of an exposed RDP port presents a significant and immediate risk that requires urgent remediation. Addressing this, along with implementing security awareness training for new hires, will further strengthen the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and readiness against external threats, moving towards a more robust and resilient security environment.</p>
