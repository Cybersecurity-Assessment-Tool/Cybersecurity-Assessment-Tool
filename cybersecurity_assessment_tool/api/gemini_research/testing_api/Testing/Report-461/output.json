            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network scan revealed an open RDP port (3389), which presents a critical security vulnerability. While the organization has some foundational security measures in place, such as requiring MFA for computer logins, an acceptable use policy, and security awareness training for new employees, there are notable gaps. Specifically, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for accessing email or sensitive data systems, and annual security awareness training for all employees is not consistently conducted. These areas represent significant risks to the organization's overall security posture.",

                        "Risk": "RDP Exposure",
                        "Overview": "Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed to the internet via an open port 3389. This allows potential attackers to attempt brute-force attacks or exploit known vulnerabilities in the RDP service. This critical vulnerability was identified through a network scan. Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to internal systems, data exfiltration, or further network compromise.",

                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Email Access",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, credential stuffing, or other password-based attacks. If an employee's email password is compromised, an attacker could gain unauthorized access to sensitive communications and potentially pivot to other systems. This was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "High",

                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems",
                        "Overview": "Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not enforced for access to sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if a user's primary credentials are compromised. A breach in such systems could lead to significant data loss, regulatory non-compliance, and severe reputational damage. This was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "High",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. This leads to a reduced understanding of current cybersecurity threats, best practices, and organizational policies among employees over time. A lack of regular training increases the likelihood of successful social engineering attacks, phishing, and other human-factor vulnerabilities. This was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "Organizational security posture"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "Immediate action is required to mitigate the critical RDP exposure by closing port 3389 to the internet. For secure remote access, a Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution should be implemented and enforced. It is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and sensitive data systems to significantly enhance account security and prevent unauthorized access. Furthermore, the organization must establish and enforce a policy for mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees to ensure a consistent and up-to-date understanding of cybersecurity best practices and emerging threats.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces critical and high-severity risks primarily due to an exposed RDP service and a lack of comprehensive MFA implementation for key systems like email and sensitive data access. While some foundational security measures are in place, the absence of annual security training and full MFA coverage leaves significant vulnerabilities. Addressing these identified risks is paramount to improving the overall security posture, protecting sensitive data, and reducing the likelihood of a successful cyberattack."
