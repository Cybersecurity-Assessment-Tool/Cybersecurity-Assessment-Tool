        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open SSH port (22) on an unspecified host, indicating a potential network exposure. From an organizational policy standpoint, the company has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and computer logins, and conducts regular security awareness training for all employees. However, critical gaps exist, including the lack of MFA for sensitive data systems and the absence of an employee acceptable use policy, which collectively increase the organization's attack surface and operational risk.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed SSH Service - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An Nmap scan identified an open SSH port (22) on a network host. If this service is exposed to the internet or an untrusted network segment without robust security configurations (e.g., strong passwords, key-based authentication, rate limiting, or IP restrictions), it presents a critical entry point for attackers. Unauthorized access via SSH could lead to full system compromise, data exfiltration, or lateral movement within the network. The specific host details were not provided in the scan data, but any such exposure warrants immediate investigation and remediation.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host(s) with open port 22</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to systems containing sensitive data. This leaves critical information vulnerable to credential compromise. If an attacker obtains a user's password through phishing, malware, or other means, they can gain direct access to sensitive data without an additional layer of authentication, significantly increasing the risk of a data breach.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive Data Systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy (AUP). Without a clear AUP, employees may not be fully aware of their responsibilities regarding the use of company IT resources, data handling, and internet browsing. This absence can lead to inconsistent security practices, increased risk of accidental data exposure, malware infections from unapproved software or websites, and makes it challenging to enforce security standards and address policy violations effectively.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All Employees</li><li>Organizational Security Posture</li><li>IT Resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately review and secure all exposed network services, particularly the identified open SSH port (22). Ensure that SSH access is restricted to trusted IP addresses, uses key-based authentication, and is regularly patched and monitored. Furthermore, implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all sensitive data systems to significantly enhance protection against credential theft. Develop and formally implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy (AUP) to clearly define expected behavior for IT resource usage and data handling, followed by mandatory training for all staff. While the organization has positive security practices such as MFA for email and computer logins, and regular security awareness training, addressing these critical gaps will significantly strengthen the overall security posture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a mixed security posture. While strong foundational elements like MFA for general access and consistent security awareness training are in place, critical vulnerabilities remain. The exposure of network services like SSH and the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems pose immediate and high-impact risks that could lead to unauthorized access and data breaches. Additionally, the lack of an acceptable use policy introduces significant operational and compliance risks. Proactive and immediate action on the outlined recommendations is crucial to elevate the organization's readiness against cyber threats and protect its valuable assets.</p>
