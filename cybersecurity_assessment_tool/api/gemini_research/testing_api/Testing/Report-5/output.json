            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network scan data indicates an open RDP port (3389) on at least one host. From an organizational policy standpoint, MFA is required for email and sensitive data systems, but not for computer logins. The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct security awareness training for new employees, although annual training is provided for all employees.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "RDP Exposure",
                        "Overview": "Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed directly to the internet. This allows potential attackers to attempt brute-force attacks or exploit vulnerabilities in the RDP service to gain unauthorized access to internal systems. The impact could range from unauthorized access to data exfiltration or system compromise. This was identified through network scanning showing port 3389 open.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "IP"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "It is strongly recommended to immediately close the exposed RDP port (3389) to the internet. For necessary remote access, implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution to secure connections. Furthermore, the organization should implement MFA for computer logins to enhance authentication security. Developing and enforcing an employee acceptable use policy is crucial for setting clear expectations regarding system usage. Finally, initiating security awareness training for all new employees is essential to establish a baseline understanding of security best practices from the start.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization faces a critical vulnerability due to an exposed RDP port, which significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access. While MFA is in place for email and sensitive data, its absence for computer logins, coupled with the lack of an acceptable use policy and new employee security training, indicates a need for immediate and comprehensive security enhancements to improve overall readiness."
