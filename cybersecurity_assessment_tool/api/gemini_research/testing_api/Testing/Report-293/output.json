            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization demonstrates a proactive approach to security awareness training for both new and existing employees, and has an acceptable use policy in place. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is utilized for email and sensitive data systems. However, a critical vulnerability was identified with an exposed Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) service, and a significant policy gap exists as MFA is not required for computer logins, increasing the risk of unauthorized access.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "RDP Exposure",
                        "Overview": "Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed to the internet on at least one host. This allows potential attackers to attempt to brute-force login credentials or exploit vulnerabilities in the RDP service to gain unauthorized access to internal systems. The impact could be full system compromise, data exfiltration, or ransomware deployment. This was identified via a network scan showing port 3389 open.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "IP address with RDP service (Port 3389)"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Computer Logins",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if an employee's credentials are stolen or compromised through phishing or other means. Without MFA, a single factor (password) is sufficient for access, making systems vulnerable to credential stuffing and brute-force attacks, potentially leading to lateral movement within the network. This was identified through the organizational security policy questionnaire.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employee workstations and servers requiring login"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately close port 3389 to external access and implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) for secure remote access to internal resources, including RDP. Furthermore, mandating Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins across the organization is crucial to enhance credential security. Regular security audits, penetration testing, and continuous employee training on phishing awareness should also be conducted to maintain a robust security posture.",
            "Conclusion": "While the organization has a solid foundation in security awareness and policy, the presence of an exposed RDP service and the absence of MFA for computer logins represent critical vulnerabilities. Addressing these technical and policy gaps is paramount to significantly reduce the attack surface and improve the overall cybersecurity readiness against sophisticated threats."
