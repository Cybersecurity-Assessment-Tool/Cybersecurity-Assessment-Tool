        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an Nginx web server (version 1.18.0) running on port 443 (HTTPS). This server is publicly accessible. Organizational data indicates a significant lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA) implementation across critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. While an acceptable use policy is in place and annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees, there is a gap in providing security awareness training for new employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. A successful compromise could lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, or further network penetration. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if user credentials are stolen or guessed. An attacker gaining access to a computer could potentially move laterally within the network, access sensitive data, or deploy malware. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Domain controllers</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This is a critical vulnerability as it provides a single point of failure for protecting the most valuable organizational assets. If an attacker obtains credentials for these systems, they can directly access, modify, or exfiltrate sensitive data without an additional layer of security. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>Cloud storage</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Nginx Web Server - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nginx web server running on port 443 is version 1.18.0. This version is significantly outdated and is likely to contain known vulnerabilities that have been patched in newer releases. Running outdated software exposes the organization to various risks, including remote code execution, denial-of-service attacks, information disclosure, and other exploits that could compromise the web server or the underlying system. This was identified via the network scan data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Nginx 1.18.0 web server</li><li>Port 443</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering and phishing attacks due to their unfamiliarity with organizational security policies and common threats. This lack of initial training increases the likelihood of new employees falling victim to attacks, potentially introducing malware or compromising credentials from the outset of their employment. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, including email systems, computer logins, and especially sensitive data systems. This will significantly enhance protection against credential-based attacks. Furthermore, the Nginx web server should be updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities and improve overall security. A robust patch management process should be established for all public-facing services. Finally, a comprehensive security awareness training program must be introduced for all new employees as part of their onboarding process, in addition to the existing annual training, to ensure that all personnel are equipped to identify and respond to cybersecurity threats from day one.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to the widespread absence of Multi-Factor Authentication across critical systems and the use of an outdated web server. While some foundational security practices like an acceptable use policy and annual training are in place, the lack of initial security awareness training for new employees also presents a notable vulnerability. Addressing these issues, particularly the MFA implementation and software patching, is crucial for improving the organization's overall security posture and readiness against common cyber threats.</p>
