        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to cybersecurity through established practices such as an employee acceptable use policy and regular security awareness training for all employees, including new hires. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is implemented for sensitive data systems, indicating an understanding of protecting critical assets. However, a significant gap exists in the broader application of MFA across other crucial access points.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. A compromised email account can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and further internal network penetration. This was identified through the organizational data indicating "Do you require MFA to access email?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee email accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if user credentials are stolen or guessed. Without a second factor, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to a workstation, potentially leading to lateral movement within the network, data theft, or malware deployment. This was identified through the organizational data indicating "Do you require MFA to log into computers?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee workstations/computers</li><li>Identity management system (e.g., Active Directory)</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points. Specifically, MFA should be mandated for email access to protect against account compromise and for all computer logins to secure endpoints from unauthorized access. Additionally, regular reviews of existing security policies and training programs should be conducted to ensure they remain current and effective against evolving threats. While MFA is in place for sensitive data systems, expanding its use to email and computer logins will create a more robust defense-in-depth strategy.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization has a commendable foundation in security awareness and policy implementation, including MFA for sensitive data systems. However, the absence of MFA for email access and computer logins represents critical vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. Addressing these gaps by implementing MFA across these vectors is paramount to achieving a more mature and resilient cybersecurity posture, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.</p>
