        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed a critical vulnerability: an open port 8080 hosting a service titled 'TOP SECRET DB', indicating direct exposure of a potentially highly sensitive database. Furthermore, the organization's internal policies show significant gaps in foundational security practices. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not enforced for email access or for sensitive data systems, leaving critical accounts and data vulnerable to credential-based attacks. While new employees receive security awareness training, there is no annual training for all employees, which can lead to a decline in security posture over time. An acceptable use policy is in place, and MFA is used for computer logins, which are positive aspects, but these are overshadowed by the critical vulnerabilities identified.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed Sensitive Database on Port 8080 - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A network scan identified an open port 8080 with the HTTP title 'TOP SECRET DB'. This indicates a potentially sensitive database or application is directly accessible from the network, likely without adequate authentication or encryption. This poses a critical risk of unauthorized access to highly confidential information, leading to severe data breaches, intellectual property theft, and significant reputational damage. The previous assessment of this port being a false positive is contradicted by the explicit 'TOP SECRET DB' title.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li><li>TOP SECRET DB application/database</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of email account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or stolen credentials. A compromised email account can serve as a pivot point for further attacks, data exfiltration, and Business Email Compromise (BEC) scams, leading to financial loss and reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee email accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised. The impact could include severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, significant financial losses, and a profound loss of customer trust.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This leads to a degradation of security knowledge over time, making employees more susceptible to social engineering attacks, phishing, and poor security practices. This increases the overall human risk factor and weakens the organization's defense against evolving cyber threats.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediately address the critical exposure of the 'TOP SECRET DB' on port 8080 by implementing strong access controls, network segmentation, and robust authentication mechanisms, or by removing it from direct network exposure if not essential. Implement mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and sensitive data systems to significantly reduce the risk of credential compromise. Establish and enforce a program for mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees to ensure up-to-date knowledge of current threats and best practices. Regularly review and update the acceptable use policy to reflect current security standards.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces critical security vulnerabilities, primarily due to an exposed sensitive database and a lack of MFA for key systems like email and sensitive data access. While some foundational elements like an acceptable use policy and MFA for computer logins are present, the absence of comprehensive MFA and ongoing security training for all employees creates significant attack vectors. Urgent action is required to mitigate these high-severity risks and improve the overall cybersecurity posture to protect sensitive information and maintain operational integrity.</p>
