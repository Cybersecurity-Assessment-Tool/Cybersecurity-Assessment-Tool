        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open port 8080, which appears to host a "TOP SECRET DB". This indicates a critical potential exposure of sensitive data. Furthermore, the organization lacks fundamental security controls such as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, an acceptable use policy, and regular security awareness training for employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed "TOP SECRET DB" on Port 8080 - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open port 8080 was identified, hosting a service titled "TOP SECRET DB". This indicates a critical exposure of potentially highly sensitive data to the network, possibly the internet, depending on firewall configurations. Unauthorized access to this database could lead to severe data breaches, intellectual property theft, and significant reputational damage. The service was identified via an Nmap scan.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li><li>TOP SECRET DB service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing, as a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to an employee's email.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for logging into computers. This leaves employee workstations vulnerable to unauthorized access if passwords are stolen or guessed, potentially allowing attackers to gain a foothold within the internal network.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network access</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without a clear AUP, employees may not understand their responsibilities regarding company assets, data handling, and internet usage, leading to increased risks of data leakage, malware infections, and non-compliance.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employees</li><li>Company assets</li><li>Data handling practices</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or annually for all employees. This leaves the workforce unprepared to identify and respond to common cyber threats like phishing, social engineering, and malware, making them potential weak links in the security posture.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security culture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediately investigate the "TOP SECRET DB" service on port 8080. Determine if it is intentionally exposed, and if so, implement robust access controls, strong authentication, and encryption. If it's not intended to be exposed, block access to port 8080 from external networks and restrict internal access to only authorized personnel. Mandate Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and computer logins. This is a critical step to significantly enhance protection against credential-based attacks. Create and implement a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) that clearly outlines expectations for secure behavior, data handling, and use of company resources. Ensure all employees acknowledge and understand this policy. Develop and implement a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees and conduct annual refresher training for all staff. This training should cover topics such as phishing, social engineering, password hygiene, and data protection best practices. Conduct regular vulnerability scans and penetration tests to identify and remediate new exposures proactively.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks, primarily due to an exposed "TOP SECRET DB" service and a lack of fundamental security controls and employee awareness programs. The absence of MFA for email and computer logins, coupled with no acceptable use policy or regular security training, creates a highly vulnerable environment. Addressing these critical and high-severity risks immediately is paramount to protecting sensitive data, preventing unauthorized access, and improving the overall security posture. The organization's readiness is currently low, requiring urgent attention to these identified areas.</p>
