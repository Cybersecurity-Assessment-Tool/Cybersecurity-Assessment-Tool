        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open MySQL port (3306), indicating a potential database exposure. Furthermore, the organization currently does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access, computer logins, or sensitive data systems. There is no employee acceptable use policy in place, and while new employees receive security awareness training, annual training for all employees is not conducted. These factors collectively point to significant security gaps.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network. This exposes the database to potential unauthorized access, data exfiltration, and service disruption if exploited. The vulnerability was identified through a network scan showing an open MySQL port with MySQL version 5.7.33.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted IP addresses or internal networks. For long-term security, consider implementing a Virtual Private Network (VPN) for secure remote access to the database. Additionally, it is crucial to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, to significantly enhance account security. Develop and enforce an employee acceptable use policy (AUP) to define expected behavior and security responsibilities. Finally, establish a program for annual security awareness training for all employees to ensure ongoing education on current threats and best practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces a high-severity risk due to an exposed MySQL database port, which could lead to unauthorized data access. The lack of MFA across critical systems, absence of an acceptable use policy, and infrequent security awareness training further exacerbate the overall risk posture. While new employee training is a positive step, the organization's current readiness against sophisticated cyber threats is low, necessitating immediate action to implement recommended security controls and policies.</p>
