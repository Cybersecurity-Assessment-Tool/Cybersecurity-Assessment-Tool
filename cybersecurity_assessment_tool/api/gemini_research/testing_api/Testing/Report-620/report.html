        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open HTTP port (80). Furthermore, the organization lacks critical security controls such as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems. There is also an absence of fundamental security policies and training, including an employee acceptable use policy and regular security awareness training for all employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open HTTP Port (80) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open HTTP port (80) was identified during the network scan. This typically indicates that a web server or other service is running and accessible over unencrypted HTTP. Without encryption (HTTPS), data transmitted over this port is vulnerable to eavesdropping and interception, potentially exposing sensitive information.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li><li>Web server/service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing, as a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to an employee's email.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee email accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not enforced for access to sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if an attacker obtains a user's password. The absence of an additional authentication factor makes these systems a prime target for data breaches.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not have an employee acceptable use policy (AUP). Without an AUP, employees may be unaware of their responsibilities regarding the use of company IT resources, leading to potential misuse, security breaches, or non-compliance with regulations. This lack of clear guidelines can introduce various human-factor risks.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training. This means new hires may not be equipped with the necessary knowledge to identify and avoid common cyber threats (e.g., phishing, social engineering) from day one, making them potential weak links in the organization's security posture.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. Regular training is crucial to keep employees updated on evolving threats and best practices. The absence of annual training leads to a decay in security knowledge and an increased susceptibility to cyberattacks over time.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, the organization should immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and sensitive data systems to significantly enhance credential security. It is crucial to establish and enforce an employee acceptable use policy to guide responsible IT resource usage. Furthermore, a comprehensive security awareness training program must be developed and deployed, ensuring all new employees receive initial training and all staff undergo annual refresher courses to stay informed about current cyber threats and best practices. For the open HTTP port 80, it is recommended to assess the service running on it, ensure it's necessary, and ideally migrate to HTTPS for encrypted communication, or restrict access if it's an internal-only service.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks due to a combination of technical vulnerabilities, such as an open HTTP port, and critical gaps in its security policies and employee training. The lack of MFA for email and sensitive data systems, coupled with the absence of an acceptable use policy and regular security awareness training, creates a highly vulnerable environment. Addressing these deficiencies through the recommended actions is paramount to improving the organization's overall security posture and reducing its susceptibility to cyberattacks and data breaches.</p>
