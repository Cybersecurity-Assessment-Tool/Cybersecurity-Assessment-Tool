        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open SSH port (22), indicating a potential entry point that requires secure configuration. Positively, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enforced for email access and computer logins. However, a critical security gap exists as MFA is not required for sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization lacks essential security awareness training for both new employees and annual refreshers for all staff, significantly increasing human-related risks. An acceptable use policy is in place, but its effectiveness is diminished without accompanying training.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if primary credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. Without MFA, a single compromised password can lead to a data breach, impacting data confidentiality and integrity.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of New Employee Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. This leaves new hires vulnerable to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) and unaware of organizational security policies and best practices from the outset. Untrained employees are more likely to make mistakes that could compromise security, leading to potential data loss or system breaches.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. Regular training is crucial to keep employees updated on evolving threats, reinforce security best practices, and maintain a strong security culture. Without it, employees may forget previous training, become complacent, or be unaware of new attack vectors, increasing the risk of human error-induced security incidents.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An Nmap scan identified an open SSH (port 22) service. While SSH is a legitimate and secure protocol for remote access, an open port always represents a potential attack surface. If not properly secured with strong authentication (e.g., key-based authentication, MFA if possible) and restricted access (e.g., firewall rules, IP whitelisting), it can be targeted by brute-force attacks or exploited if vulnerabilities exist in the SSH server software, potentially leading to unauthorized system access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Network perimeter</li><li>Systems accessible via SSH (port 22)</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, the organization should immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access. A comprehensive security awareness training program must be established, including mandatory training for all new employees upon onboarding and annual refresher training for all staff. This training should cover topics such as phishing, social engineering, password hygiene, and data handling best practices. Furthermore, the security of the open SSH port (port 22) should be reviewed. It is recommended to restrict access to trusted IP addresses, enforce strong authentication methods (e.g., SSH keys), disable password authentication if possible, and ensure the SSH server software is regularly patched and configured securely.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing MFA for email and computer logins and having an acceptable use policy. However, significant vulnerabilities exist, particularly the lack of MFA for sensitive data systems and the complete absence of security awareness training for both new and existing employees. The presence of an open SSH port also warrants attention. Addressing these critical gaps through the immediate implementation of MFA for sensitive systems, establishing robust and recurring security awareness training, and securing remote access points is paramount to enhancing the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and reducing its susceptibility to data breaches and other security incidents.</p>
