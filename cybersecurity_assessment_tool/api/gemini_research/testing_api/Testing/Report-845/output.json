            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network shows an active host with an open RDP port (3389). While the organization has implemented MFA for email and sensitive data systems, it does not require MFA for computer logins. Security awareness training is conducted for new and all employees annually, which is a positive, but there is no documented employee acceptable use policy in place.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "RDP Exposure",
                        "Overview": "Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed directly to the internet. This allows potential attackers to attempt brute-force attacks or exploit vulnerabilities in the RDP service to gain unauthorized access to internal systems. This was identified via a network scan showing port 3389 open.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "IP"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "It is strongly recommended to immediately close the exposed RDP port (3389) to prevent unauthorized access attempts. For necessary remote access, implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution to secure the connection. Furthermore, the organization should implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to add an essential layer of security against credential theft. Finally, developing and enforcing an employee acceptable use policy is crucial to define expected behavior and minimize internal risks.",
            "Conclusion": "The assessment identified a critical vulnerability with an exposed RDP port, posing a significant risk of unauthorized system access. While the organization has strengths in MFA for email and sensitive data, and regular security awareness training, the lack of MFA for computer logins and an employee acceptable use policy represents notable security gaps. Addressing these issues is crucial for enhancing the overall security posture and reducing the attack surface."
