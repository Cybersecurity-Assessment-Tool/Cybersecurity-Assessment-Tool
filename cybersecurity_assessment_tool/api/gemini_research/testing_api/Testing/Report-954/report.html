        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization has implemented multi-factor authentication (MFA) for computer logins and access to sensitive data systems, and provides security awareness training for new employees. However, MFA is not required for email access, there is no employee acceptable use policy, and annual security awareness training for all employees is not conducted. A recent network scan indicates that port 80 is closed, suggesting no unencrypted web server is directly exposed on this port.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2><p>No specific vulnerabilities were identified.</p><h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>It is strongly recommended to implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for email access to significantly enhance protection against unauthorized access and phishing attempts. The organization should also develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to clearly define expected security behaviors and responsibilities. Furthermore, establishing a program for annual security awareness training for all employees is crucial to ensure ongoing vigilance against evolving cyber threats and to reinforce secure practices across the organization.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization has a mixed security posture, with some critical controls like MFA for sensitive systems in place, but significant gaps in foundational areas such as email MFA, acceptable use policies, and recurring security awareness training. While the provided network scan did not identify an open unencrypted web server, these policy and training deficiencies represent substantial internal risks that could be exploited through social engineering or other internal vectors. Addressing these areas is paramount to improving the overall cybersecurity readiness and resilience of the organization.</p>
