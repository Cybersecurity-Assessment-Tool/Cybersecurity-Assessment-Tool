        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network assessment reveals a mixed security posture. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for email and sensitive data systems, a critical gap exists as MFA is not required for computer logins. Furthermore, the organization lacks fundamental security policies, specifically an employee acceptable use policy, and does not conduct essential security awareness training for new or existing employees. Network scanning identified an open SSH port (22), which, if not properly secured, presents a potential attack vector. An additional critical vulnerability, 'Localhost Exposed', was also noted, indicating a severe internal exposure.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH port (22) was detected on a host within the network. While SSH is a legitimate service for remote access, an open port without stringent security controls (e.g., strong authentication, restricted access, up-to-date daemon) can be exploited by attackers for brute-force attempts, credential stuffing, or to leverage vulnerabilities in the SSH server software. This was identified through network scanning.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 22</li><li>Host IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Authentication for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly elevates the risk of unauthorized access to employee workstations and the internal network. In the event of compromised credentials (e.g., via phishing, malware, or weak passwords), an attacker can gain full access without an additional layer of verification, leading to potential data breaches, system compromise, and lateral movement within the network. This was identified from organizational policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee Workstations</li><li>Login Systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks an employee acceptable use policy (AUP). Without a formal AUP, there are no clear guidelines or rules defining the appropriate use of company IT resources, data, and internet access by employees. This absence can lead to misuse of company assets, increased risk of malware introduction, data leakage, and potential legal liabilities due to employees engaging in unauthorized or risky activities without clear boundaries. This was identified from organizational policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All Employees</li><li>Company IT Resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees, nor does it provide annual training for all employees. This leaves the workforce vulnerable to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting), unaware of best practices for data handling, password security, and identifying malicious activities. Human error is a primary factor in many security incidents, and a lack of training significantly increases this risk, making the organization more susceptible to breaches and compliance failures. This was identified from organizational policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All Employees</li><li>Organizational Security Posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This vulnerability indicates a critical exposure, potentially allowing unauthorized access to internal services or data. The high severity suggests a direct and severe impact if exploited, potentially leading to full system compromise or data exfiltration. The specific nature of the exposure requires immediate investigation and remediation.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement robust security measures. For the open SSH port, ensure strong authentication (e.g., SSH keys, disable password authentication), restrict access via firewall rules, and keep the SSH daemon updated. Immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to enhance endpoint security. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy (AUP) to establish clear guidelines for IT resource usage. Furthermore, establish mandatory security awareness training for all new hires and conduct annual refresher training for all employees to educate them on cybersecurity best practices and threat identification. The 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability requires immediate investigation to understand its root cause and implement specific remediation, such as network segmentation, access controls, or service configuration changes, to eliminate the critical exposure.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization exhibits a foundational understanding of security by implementing MFA for email and sensitive data. However, significant vulnerabilities exist, particularly the lack of MFA for computer logins, the absence of an acceptable use policy, and a complete lack of security awareness training. These gaps, combined with an open SSH port and a critical 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability, indicate a low overall security readiness. Addressing these critical and high-severity risks through policy implementation, technical controls, and employee education is paramount to improving the organization's cybersecurity posture and reducing its susceptibility to attacks.</p>
