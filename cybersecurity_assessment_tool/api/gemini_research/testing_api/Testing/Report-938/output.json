                "Summary": "The organization's network includes an FTP server running vsftpd 2.3.4, which currently allows anonymous login. Internally, while Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required for email and computer logins, it is notably absent for sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization lacks fundamental security policies and training, specifically an employee acceptable use policy and any form of security awareness training for both new and existing employees. A significant number of workstations are still operating on Windows 7, an end-of-life operating system.",

New hires may be unaware of common cyber threats (phishing, social engineering) and best security practices, making them more susceptible to attacks and potentially introducing vulnerabilities into the network.

Regular training is crucial to keep employees updated on evolving threats and reinforce secure behaviors.

                        "Risk": "Outdated Windows Policy",
                        "Overview": "Computers are running Windows 7, an operating system that has reached its end-of-life and no longer receives security updates from Microsoft. This exposes the workstations to known and unpatched vulnerabilities, making them highly susceptible to malware, exploits, and other cyberattacks. This was identified through current risk assessment data.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "Immediate action is required to disable anonymous FTP access and configure the FTP server to require authentication, considering an upgrade or replacement of the vsftpd service if outdated. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be implemented for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access. The organization should develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy, clearly outlining expected behavior regarding company assets and data. Mandatory security awareness training for all new employees during onboarding, as well as annual training for all employees, is crucial to foster a strong security culture. Finally, a project to upgrade all workstations from Windows 7 to a currently supported operating system like Windows 10 or 11 should be initiated, which may involve hardware upgrades or replacements.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization faces several critical and high-severity vulnerabilities, primarily stemming from an outdated operating system on workstations, an insecurely configured FTP server, and a significant gap in access control for sensitive data systems due to the lack of MFA. Compounding these technical issues is a weak security culture, evidenced by the absence of essential policies and security awareness training. While some MFA is in place, the overall readiness is low, leaving the organization highly susceptible to data breaches, malware infections, and unauthorized access. Immediate action is required to address these fundamental security weaknesses."
