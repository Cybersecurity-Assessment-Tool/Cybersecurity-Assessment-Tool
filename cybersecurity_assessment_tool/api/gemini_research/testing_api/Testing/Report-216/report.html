        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization currently employs Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access, which is a positive security measure. However, significant gaps exist in their security posture, particularly concerning MFA implementation for computer logins and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the absence of an employee acceptable use policy and dedicated security awareness training for new employees indicates a lack of foundational security controls and human element preparedness. While annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees, the initial onboarding period for new hires remains a vulnerability.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for computer logins. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee workstations and the internal network if credentials are stolen or compromised. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access, potentially leading to lateral movement within the network and further breaches.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee workstations</li><li>Internal network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA to access sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk, as compromised credentials could lead to direct access to confidential information, intellectual property, or customer data. Such a breach could result in severe data loss, regulatory non-compliance, significant financial penalties, and severe reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All sensitive data systems (e.g., CRM, ERP, HR systems, financial databases)</li><li>Confidential data repositories</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal acceptable use policy (AUP). Without a clear AUP, employees may be unaware of their responsibilities regarding company IT resources, data handling, internet usage, and security best practices. This absence can lead to misuse of company assets, increased exposure to malware, unintentional data leakage, and potential compliance issues due to inconsistent employee behavior.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Data handling procedures</li><li>Network usage</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct mandatory security awareness training for new employees during their onboarding process. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering attacks, such as phishing, as they may not be familiar with company-specific security protocols, common threats, or how to identify malicious attempts. This oversight leaves the organization vulnerable during a critical period when employees are most susceptible to manipulation.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Email systems</li><li>Internal network</li><li>Overall security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and, critically, for all sensitive data systems. This will significantly enhance protection against credential theft. Furthermore, the organization should immediately develop and enforce a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) to clearly define employee responsibilities and expected behaviors regarding IT asset usage and data handling. Finally, a mandatory security awareness training program must be established for all new employees as part of their onboarding process, complementing the existing annual training to ensure a consistent and robust security culture from day one.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing MFA for email. However, the absence of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, coupled with the lack of an acceptable use policy and new employee security training, indicates significant vulnerabilities in both technical controls and human element preparedness. While annual training is a positive step, these critical gaps leave the organization exposed to a range of cyber threats, including unauthorized access, data breaches, and compliance failures. Addressing these areas is paramount to improving the overall cybersecurity readiness and resilience.</p>
