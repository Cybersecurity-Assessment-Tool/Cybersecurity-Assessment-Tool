            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network scan indicates a host is operational. While the scan data suggests port 80 is closed, a specific vulnerability assessment identified a potential unencrypted web server with port 80 being open. On the organizational policy front, the company has robust multi-factor authentication (MFA) in place for email access, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. However, there is a notable absence of an employee acceptable use policy and security awareness training for new employees, although annual security awareness training is conducted for all existing employees.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Unencrypted Web Server",
                        "Overview": "This risk indicates the presence of an unencrypted web server, with port 80 identified as open. An unencrypted web server transmits data in plain text, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping and data interception by malicious actors. This can lead to the compromise of sensitive information exchanged over the network. The vulnerability was identified through a security assessment.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Port 80"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is recommended to immediately address the unencrypted web server by ensuring port 80 is properly secured or closed if not required. For long-term security, implement SSL/TLS encryption for all web services to protect data in transit. Furthermore, the organization should develop and implement an employee acceptable use policy to clearly define expected behavior and security responsibilities. It is also crucial to introduce security awareness training for all new employees during their onboarding process to establish a foundational understanding of cybersecurity best practices from day one, complementing the existing annual training.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization demonstrates a good foundation in access control with widespread MFA implementation. However, the presence of a potentially unencrypted web server poses a direct risk to data confidentiality. Additionally, the absence of an acceptable use policy and initial security awareness training for new hires indicates gaps in foundational security governance and human element defenses. Addressing these vulnerabilities and policy gaps is crucial for enhancing the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and reducing its attack surface."
