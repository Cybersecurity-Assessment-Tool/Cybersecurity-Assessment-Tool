            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network scan revealed an open port 80, indicating an active web server that could be a potential entry point for attackers if not properly secured. While the organization has good practices in place for security awareness training and an acceptable use policy, there are significant gaps in multi-factor authentication (MFA) implementation. Specifically, MFA is not required for logging into computers or accessing sensitive data systems, which poses a substantial risk to overall security.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Unsecured Web Server (Open Port 80)",
                        "Overview": "An open port 80 indicates a web server is running, potentially exposing the organization to web-based vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, or directory traversal if the web application is not properly secured and patched. This was identified via Nmap scan data.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require MFA for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if user credentials are stolen or guessed, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication. This was identified from the organizational data.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employee computers",
                            "User authentication systems"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require MFA to access sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk for data breaches, as compromised credentials could grant direct access to sensitive information without an additional layer of security. This was identified from the organizational data.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Sensitive data systems",
                            "User authentication for sensitive data systems"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and for accessing all sensitive data systems. This will significantly enhance security by requiring an additional verification step beyond just a password. For the web server operating on port 80, a thorough security audit should be conducted to ensure all applications are patched, securely configured, and protected against common web vulnerabilities. Consider enforcing HTTPS (port 443) and redirecting all HTTP traffic, or placing the web server behind a Web Application Firewall (WAF). Regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing should also be performed on the web server.",
            "Conclusion": "While the organization demonstrates good foundational security practices with employee acceptable use policies and regular security awareness training, the absence of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems represents critical vulnerabilities. The presence of an open web server on port 80 also requires immediate attention to prevent potential exploitation. Addressing these MFA gaps and securing the web infrastructure are paramount to improving the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and readiness against modern threats."
