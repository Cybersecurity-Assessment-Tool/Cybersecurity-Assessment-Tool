        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes an Nginx web server (version 1.18.0) on port 443 (HTTPS). While security awareness training is conducted for new and existing employees annually, several critical security controls are missing. Specifically, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for email access or computer logins, significantly increasing the risk of unauthorized access. Furthermore, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy, which can lead to inconsistent security practices and increased insider threats.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This leaves email accounts vulnerable to credential stuffing, phishing, and brute-force attacks. A compromised email account can serve as a gateway for business email compromise (BEC) scams, data exfiltration, and further penetration into the organization's network. This was identified from the organizational data indicating no MFA for email.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>User accounts</li><li>Organizational data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not enforced for logging into computers. This means that if an attacker obtains a user's password through phishing, malware, or other means, they can gain direct access to the employee's workstation. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access, lateral movement within the network, data theft, and the deployment of malicious software. This was identified from the organizational data indicating no MFA for computer login.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee workstations</li><li>Network access points</li><li>Internal systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without a clear AUP, employees may engage in activities that pose security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling company data, without clear guidelines or consequences. This can lead to increased exposure to malware, data breaches, and potential legal liabilities. This was identified from the organizational data indicating no acceptable use policy.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network resources</li><li>IT infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Nginx Web Server - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nginx web server running on port 443 is version 1.18.0. This version is End-of-Life (EOL) and no longer receives security updates or patches. Running EOL software exposes the web server to known and newly discovered vulnerabilities, which can be exploited for remote code execution, denial of service attacks, information disclosure, or defacement. This was identified during the network scan.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Web server (nginx 1.18.0)</li><li>Port 443</li><li>Hosted web applications</li><li>Public-facing services</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and computer logins across the organization. This critical step will significantly enhance protection against credential-based attacks. Furthermore, develop and enforce a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) to clearly define acceptable behavior regarding company IT resources and data, ensuring all employees are aware of their responsibilities. Finally, the Nginx web server should be updated to a currently supported and patched version to address known vulnerabilities and ensure ongoing security updates. Regular vulnerability scanning and patch management should be integrated into the security operations.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security through its regular security awareness training. However, significant vulnerabilities exist due to the absence of MFA for email and computer logins, the lack of an acceptable use policy, and the use of an outdated Nginx web server. Addressing these high-severity risks is paramount to improving the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and readiness against common attack vectors.</p>
