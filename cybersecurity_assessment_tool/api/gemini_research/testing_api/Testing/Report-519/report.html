        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes a MySQL database (version 5.7.33) via port 3306. In terms of organizational security practices, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is mandated for email and sensitive data systems but is not required for computer logins. The organization has an acceptable use policy and provides security awareness training for new employees, but annual security awareness training for all employees is not conducted.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is openly accessible on the network, running version 5.7.33. This direct exposure of a database service to the network without additional layers of security (like a VPN or strict firewall rules) presents a significant attack surface. An attacker could exploit known vulnerabilities in this specific MySQL version or attempt brute-force attacks to gain unauthorized access to the database and its contents.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li><li>MySQL Database Server (version 5.7.33)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Authentication for Workstations - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for employee computer logins. This means that a single factor (username and password) is sufficient to gain access to an employee's workstation. If an attacker obtains these credentials through phishing, malware, or other means, they can easily bypass security and gain unauthorized access to internal systems and data, leading to potential data breaches, system compromise, or lateral movement within the network.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee workstations</li><li>Internal network access points</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Ongoing Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive initial security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This lack of continuous education means that employees' knowledge of current threats, best practices, and organizational policies can degrade over time. This increases the susceptibility to social engineering attacks (e.g., sophisticated phishing campaigns), malware infections, and unintentional policy violations, thereby weakening the overall human firewall.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network security</li><li>Incident response capabilities</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement strict firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted internal IP addresses or specific application servers. For long-term security, consider placing the database behind a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or within a segmented network zone, accessible only via secure tunnels. Furthermore, it is critical to enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to significantly enhance workstation security and prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised. Finally, establish and regularly conduct mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees to ensure continuous education on evolving cyber threats, best practices, and organizational security policies, thereby strengthening the human element of defense.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant security risks primarily due to an exposed MySQL database and a lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for computer logins. While some foundational security practices like MFA for email and sensitive data, and initial employee training are in place, the absence of MFA for workstations and ongoing annual security awareness training leaves critical gaps. Addressing these vulnerabilities is crucial for improving the overall security posture and readiness against potential cyber threats.</p>
