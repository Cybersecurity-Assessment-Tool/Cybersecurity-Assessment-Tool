        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network assessment revealed critical vulnerabilities, primarily the direct exposure of a 'TOP SECRET DB' on an open port 8080. Furthermore, significant gaps exist in the organization's security posture regarding authentication and employee policies. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is used for email, it is notably absent for computer logins and access to sensitive data systems. The organization also lacks an acceptable use policy and does not provide security awareness training for new employees, although annual training is conducted for existing staff. These findings indicate a low state of readiness against common cyber threats, particularly those targeting data confidentiality and access control.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed Sensitive Database - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Port 8080 was found to be open and hosting a service titled 'TOP SECRET DB'. This direct exposure of what appears to be a highly sensitive database to the network presents a critical risk of unauthorized access, data exfiltration, and potential compromise of confidential information. The presence of such a service on an open port without apparent strong access controls is a severe security misconfiguration.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li><li>TOP SECRET DB service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly weakens endpoint security, making systems highly vulnerable to credential stuffing, phishing, and brute-force attacks. If an attacker obtains a single set of credentials, they can gain unauthorized access to an employee's workstation and potentially pivot to other systems within the network.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers</li><li>Network endpoints</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access sensitive data systems. This is a critical security gap, especially in light of the 'TOP SECRET DB' found exposed on port 8080. Without MFA, sensitive data systems are protected only by a single factor (e.g., password), making them highly susceptible to unauthorized access if credentials are compromised, directly impacting data confidentiality and integrity.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All sensitive data systems</li><li>TOP SECRET DB on port 8080</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This absence means there are no formal guidelines or rules for employees regarding the proper and secure use of company IT resources, including hardware, software, and network access. This increases the risk of misuse of company assets, inadvertent data breaches, and non-compliance with industry regulations, as employees may not understand their responsibilities.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training upon joining the organization. This leaves new hires unprepared for common cyber threats, such as phishing, social engineering, and malware, from their first day. Without foundational security knowledge, new employees are more likely to make mistakes that could compromise organizational security, increasing the overall human risk factor.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security culture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediate action is required to address the critical vulnerabilities identified. Firstly, the service on port 8080, identified as 'TOP SECRET DB', must be immediately secured or taken offline, and a thorough investigation into its purpose, data sensitivity, and exposure history should be conducted. Secondly, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) should be implemented across all computer logins and, most critically, for all sensitive data systems to significantly enhance access control. Furthermore, the organization must develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to establish clear guidelines for IT resource usage. Mandatory security awareness training should be introduced for all new employees, complementing the existing annual training, to ensure a consistent baseline of security knowledge across the workforce. Finally, a comprehensive penetration test is recommended to identify any other potential exposures and validate the effectiveness of implemented security controls.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks, primarily due to the direct exposure of a sensitive database and critical gaps in authentication protocols and employee security policies. The absence of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, coupled with the lack of an acceptable use policy and new employee security training, creates a highly vulnerable environment. While annual security awareness training is a positive step, the identified deficiencies indicate a low overall security readiness. Addressing these vulnerabilities with urgency is paramount to protect sensitive data, maintain operational integrity, and enhance the organization's resilience against cyber threats.</p>
