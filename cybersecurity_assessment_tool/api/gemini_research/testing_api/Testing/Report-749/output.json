            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network has an open RDP port (3389). While multi-factor authentication (MFA) is used for email and computer logins, it is notably absent for sensitive data systems. The organization maintains an acceptable use policy and conducts regular security awareness training for all employees.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "RDP Exposure",
                        "Overview": "Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed to the internet, which can allow attackers to attempt brute-force attacks or exploit vulnerabilities in the RDP service to gain unauthorized access to internal systems. This was identified by an open port 3389 during network scanning.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Port 3389",
                            "Remote Desktop Protocol service"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "It is strongly recommended to immediately close the exposed RDP port (3389) to the internet. For necessary remote access, implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution to secure connections. Furthermore, implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to enhance access control and prevent unauthorized access, aligning with the existing MFA practices for email and computer logins.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces a critical risk due to an exposed RDP port, which presents a significant attack vector. A notable gap exists in the application of multi-factor authentication for sensitive data systems, despite its use for other critical access points. While the organization demonstrates good practices in employee training and policy, these technical vulnerabilities require immediate attention to improve overall security readiness."
