        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates some foundational security practices, such as requiring MFA for computer logins and having an acceptable use policy. However, significant gaps exist in critical areas. The provided network scan data indicates no open ports on the scanned host, suggesting a potentially hardened external network perimeter, though the scope of this scan is limited and does not provide a comprehensive view of internal network security or application-level vulnerabilities. The primary risks identified stem from a lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems, as well as a complete absence of security awareness training for both new and existing employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts through credential stuffing, phishing, or brute-force attacks. A compromised email account can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and serve as an initial access point for broader network penetration.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee email accounts</li><li>Email server/service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Access to systems containing sensitive data does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). This poses a critical risk, as stolen or weak credentials could grant attackers direct access to confidential information, intellectual property, or personal data, leading to severe data breaches, regulatory fines, and reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts with access to sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering and phishing attacks due to their unfamiliarity with organizational security policies, common threats, and internal procedures. This lack of initial training leaves them vulnerable and can inadvertently introduce significant risks to the organization's security posture.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Regular Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not provide security awareness training to all employees at least once per year. Without regular, updated training, employees may not be aware of evolving cyber threats, new attack vectors, or changes in organizational security policies and best practices. This increases the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents, such as clicking malicious links, falling for social engineering scams, or mishandling sensitive information.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all email services and sensitive data systems immediately. This is a critical step to protect against credential-based attacks. Furthermore, a comprehensive security awareness training program should be established. This program must include mandatory training for all new employees during their onboarding process, covering essential security practices and common threats. Additionally, annual refresher training should be provided to all employees to keep them informed about the latest cyber threats, organizational policies, and best practices. Regular training helps foster a security-conscious culture and reduces the risk of human-factor vulnerabilities. While the network scan was limited, it is advisable to conduct more in-depth vulnerability assessments and penetration testing on the internal network and critical applications to identify any hidden technical vulnerabilities.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to the absence of MFA for critical services like email and sensitive data systems, coupled with a complete lack of security awareness training for its workforce. While some basic security controls are in place, these gaps leave the organization highly susceptible to various cyberattacks, including data breaches and unauthorized access. Addressing these fundamental human and access control vulnerabilities is paramount to improving the organization's overall security posture and readiness against modern cyber threats.</p>
