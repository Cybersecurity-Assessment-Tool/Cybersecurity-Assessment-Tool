        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The network scan identified at least one active host with an open SSH (port 22) service, indicating potential remote access capabilities. Organizational data reveals critical gaps in security posture, specifically concerning Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, and the absence of essential employee security awareness training and policy enforcement. While MFA is utilized for computer logins and sensitive data systems, these other areas represent significant vulnerabilities.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unsecured Remote Access (Open SSH Port) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH port (22) was detected on at least one host. While SSH is a secure protocol, an open port represents an attack surface. If not properly secured with strong authentication (e.g., key-based authentication, MFA) and regularly patched, it can be exploited for unauthorized remote access, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. This was identified via an Nmap scan.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host(s) with open port 22</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of email account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. A compromised email account can lead to data breaches, business email compromise (BEC) scams, and further lateral movement within the network. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee email accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without a clear AUP, employees may engage in activities that introduce security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive data, without understanding the consequences or proper guidelines. This increases the likelihood of malware infections, data leakage, and compliance violations. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training. This leaves them vulnerable to common social engineering attacks, phishing attempts, and unaware of organizational security best practices from the start of their employment. Untrained new hires can inadvertently introduce malware, expose credentials, or violate data handling policies. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Annual Security Awareness Training for All Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. Without regular training, employees' knowledge of evolving cyber threats, new attack vectors, and updated security policies can become outdated. This increases the overall risk of human error leading to security incidents, as employees may not recognize current threats like advanced phishing techniques or new malware strains. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts. For the open SSH port, ensure strong authentication methods like key-based authentication are used, restrict access to trusted IP ranges, and maintain regular patching. Develop and implement a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) that clearly outlines expectations for secure behavior and data handling, ensuring all employees acknowledge and understand it. Furthermore, establish a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees upon onboarding and implement annual refresher training for all employees to keep them informed about current threats, best practices, and organizational policies, covering topics such as phishing, social engineering, password hygiene, and data protection.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to a lack of fundamental security controls and employee awareness programs. The absence of MFA for email, a critical defense against account compromise, combined with no formal acceptable use policy or regular security awareness training, creates a substantial attack surface. While MFA is in place for computer logins and sensitive data systems, these gaps in email and employee education leave the organization highly susceptible to social engineering, phishing, and insider threats. Addressing these foundational issues is paramount to improving the overall security posture and readiness against common cyberattacks.</p>
