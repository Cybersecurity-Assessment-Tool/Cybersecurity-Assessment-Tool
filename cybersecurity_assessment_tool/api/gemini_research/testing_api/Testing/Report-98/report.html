        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an active FTP server (vsftpd 2.3.4) with anonymous login enabled on port 21, posing a significant data exposure risk. Furthermore, an assessment of organizational policies indicates several critical gaps in security posture. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not enforced for email access or sensitive data systems, leaving these crucial assets vulnerable to credential-based attacks. The absence of an employee acceptable use policy creates ambiguity regarding the secure and appropriate use of IT resources. Additionally, a previously identified risk highlights that workstations are running an outdated and unsupported operating system, Windows 7, which is highly susceptible to known vulnerabilities. While security awareness training for new and existing employees is in place, these fundamental policy and system vulnerabilities severely undermine the overall security readiness.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Anonymous FTP Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The FTP server (vsftpd 2.3.4) allows anonymous login, which can lead to unauthorized access to files, data leakage, or even server compromise if write permissions are misconfigured. This was identified via an Nmap scan on port 21.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>FTP Server (vsftpd 2.3.4 on port 21)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing or credential stuffing, as a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to an employee's email, potentially leading to further system breaches.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email System</li><li>Employee Accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are compromised, increasing the risk of data breaches and regulatory non-compliance.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive Data Systems</li><li>Employee Accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This means there are no clear guidelines for employees on the proper and secure use of company IT resources, potentially leading to misuse, security incidents, and legal liabilities due to unmanaged employee behavior.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All Employees</li><li>IT Resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Windows Policy - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Computers are running Windows 7. This operating system is past its end-of-life and no longer receives security updates, making systems highly vulnerable to known exploits and malware. Continued use poses a severe risk of system compromise and data loss.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediate action is required to address the identified vulnerabilities. For the anonymous FTP access, disable anonymous login and ensure only authenticated, authorized users can access the server. Review and restrict permissions on the FTP server to the absolute minimum necessary. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical systems, starting with email and sensitive data systems, to significantly enhance credential security. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy that clearly outlines expectations for secure IT resource usage. Regarding the outdated Windows 7 workstations, prioritize upgrading these systems to a currently supported operating system like Windows 10 or 11. This can be achieved through a phased upgrade plan (easy fix) or a complete hardware refresh (long-term fix) if current hardware is incompatible. Regularly review and update security policies and conduct vulnerability scans to proactively identify and mitigate new risks.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization faces significant cybersecurity risks due to critical vulnerabilities in both its technical infrastructure and security policies. The presence of anonymous FTP access, lack of MFA for key systems, absence of an acceptable use policy, and the continued use of an unsupported operating system (Windows 7) collectively create a highly exploitable environment. While security awareness training is a positive step, it is insufficient to counteract these fundamental weaknesses. Addressing these issues with urgency is paramount to improving the organization's security posture and protecting its assets from potential cyber threats.</p>
