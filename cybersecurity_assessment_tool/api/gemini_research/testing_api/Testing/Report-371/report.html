        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open SSH port (22), indicating a potential entry point for attackers. Furthermore, an analysis of organizational data highlighted significant security posture weaknesses, including the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems, and a complete lack of security awareness training for both new and existing employees. A critical internal service exposure was also identified, suggesting a severe misconfiguration or lack of proper network segmentation. While an acceptable use policy is in place, these fundamental gaps expose the organization to various cyber threats.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An Nmap scan identified an open SSH port (22) on a host within the network. While SSH is a legitimate service, an open port presents a potential attack surface for brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or exploitation of SSH vulnerabilities if not properly secured. This was identified via network scanning.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with open port 22</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inconsistent MFA Implementation - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email or sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication. This was identified through organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email systems</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees and does not provide annual training for all employees. This leaves employees vulnerable to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) and makes them less likely to identify and report security threats, increasing the overall human risk factor. This was identified through organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Critical Internal Service Exposure - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A critical vulnerability was identified where a service, potentially intended for localhost or a restricted internal network segment, is exposed to a broader network, possibly externally. This misconfiguration allows unauthorized access to critical internal services, leading to severe data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service. The exact service and scope of exposure require further investigation, but the initial assessment indicates a critical risk.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Internal network services</li><li>Affected IP(s)</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately secure the open SSH port by implementing strong authentication methods (e.g., SSH keys, disabling password authentication), disabling root login, configuring rate limiting, and ensuring robust firewall rules are in place. Furthermore, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be promptly implemented for all email access and sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access from compromised credentials. A comprehensive security awareness training program should be established, including mandatory training for all new hires and annual refreshers for all employees, to educate staff on identifying and responding to cyber threats. Finally, the critical internal service exposure requires immediate investigation and remediation to ensure services are correctly bound to intended interfaces and proper network segmentation is enforced to prevent unauthorized access.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity vulnerabilities, including an exposed SSH port, critical gaps in Multi-Factor Authentication implementation for key systems, and a complete absence of security awareness training. These issues, compounded by a critical internal service exposure, indicate a low state of readiness against common cyber threats. Urgent action is required to address these fundamental security weaknesses and significantly improve the organization's overall security posture.</p>
