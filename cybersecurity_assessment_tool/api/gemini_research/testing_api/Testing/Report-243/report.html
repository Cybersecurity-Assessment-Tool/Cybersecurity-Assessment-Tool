        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open MySQL port (3306) running version 5.7.33, indicating a potential database exposure. Regarding organizational security practices, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for email access, although it is implemented for computer logins and sensitive data systems. The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees, despite providing it for new hires.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network, exposing the database service. This allows potential attackers to attempt to connect to the database directly, increasing the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, or service disruption. The vulnerability was identified through a network port scan.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted IP addresses or internal systems. For a more robust long-term solution, consider placing the database behind a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or within a segmented network accessible only via secure channels. Furthermore, the organization should immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access to enhance account security. Developing and enforcing a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy is crucial for setting clear expectations regarding secure behavior. Finally, establishing a program for annual security awareness training for all employees will help reinforce best practices and reduce human-factor risks.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In conclusion, the organization faces a significant risk due to an exposed MySQL database port, which could lead to unauthorized access and data compromise. While MFA is in place for some critical systems, the absence of MFA for email access presents a notable vulnerability. Additionally, the lack of an employee acceptable use policy and annual security awareness training indicates gaps in foundational security hygiene and employee education. Addressing these vulnerabilities and implementing the recommended controls is essential to improve the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and readiness against potential threats.</p>
