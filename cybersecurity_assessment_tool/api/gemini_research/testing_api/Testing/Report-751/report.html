        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed at least one host with an open SSH port (22), indicating a potential remote access point. Critically, the organizational data highlights significant security deficiencies, including a complete lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, there is no security awareness training for new employees, nor is there annual training for all employees, leaving the workforce vulnerable to social engineering and other human-centric attacks. While an acceptable use policy is in place, the absence of foundational security controls and employee education creates a high-risk environment.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing, as a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's email, potentially leading to further internal network access or data exfiltration.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li><li>Organizational data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This leaves employee workstations vulnerable to unauthorized access if passwords are stolen or guessed, potentially enabling an attacker to gain a foothold within the internal network, perform lateral movement, and access sensitive resources.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network access points</li><li>Internal systems</li></ul>

                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This is a critical vulnerability, as it means that a compromised password could directly lead to unauthorized access to confidential information, potentially resulting in severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and significant reputational and financial damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>Confidential information repositories</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training. This means they may not be aware of common cyber threats (e.g., phishing, social engineering, malware) or organizational security policies, making them more susceptible to attacks and potentially introducing vulnerabilities into the organization from their first day.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li><li>Internal network users</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Regular Security Awareness Training for All Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. Without regular training, employees' knowledge of evolving cyber threats and best practices can become outdated, increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents, such as clicking malicious links or falling for social engineering tactics.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li><li>Human element of security</li></ul>

            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port (22) without Hardening Details - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH port (22) was detected on a host. While SSH is a legitimate service for secure remote access, an exposed SSH port without proper hardening (e.g., strong passwords, key-based authentication, rate limiting, disabling root login, MFA integration) can be a target for brute-force attacks or exploitation if the SSH server software is vulnerable. Without further details on its configuration, it represents a potential attack surface.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with open port 22</li><li>Network perimeter</li><li>Remote access services</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's cybersecurity posture, immediate implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is paramount across all critical access points, including email systems, computer logins, and especially sensitive data systems. Concurrently, a robust security awareness training program must be established, encompassing mandatory training for all new hires and annual refresher courses for all employees to educate them on current cyber threats and best practices. For the identified open SSH port, a comprehensive hardening strategy should be applied, including the use of key-based authentication, disabling root login, implementing strong password policies, and considering IP-based access restrictions. Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments should also be conducted to proactively identify and address emerging risks.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to a widespread lack of Multi-Factor Authentication across critical access points and an absence of crucial security awareness training for both new and existing employees. An open SSH port also presents a potential attack surface if not properly secured. These deficiencies create a high susceptibility to credential-based attacks, social engineering, and human error, significantly increasing the likelihood of unauthorized access and data breaches. While an acceptable use policy is in place, its effectiveness is undermined by the absence of foundational security controls and employee education. Addressing these fundamental gaps is paramount to improving the organization's overall security posture and readiness against modern cyber threats.</p>
