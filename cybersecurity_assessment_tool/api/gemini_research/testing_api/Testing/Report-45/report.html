        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The network scan identified an open port 8080 hosting a service labeled 'TOP SECRET DB'. Furthermore, the organization's policies indicate a critical lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA) for accessing email, logging into computers, and accessing sensitive data systems. While an acceptable use policy is in place and new employees receive initial security awareness training, there is no annual recurring security awareness training for all employees, leaving the organization vulnerable to evolving threats.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed Sensitive Database - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An Nmap scan revealed an open port 8080, which is hosting a service identified as 'TOP SECRET DB'. Exposing a database, especially one labeled 'TOP SECRET', on an open port without apparent authentication or encryption mechanisms is a critical security flaw. This could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, data manipulation, and significant reputational and financial damage. The service title itself indicates the sensitive nature of the data it likely contains.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li><li>TOP SECRET DB service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. If an attacker gains access to an employee's email, they could use it for further internal phishing, impersonation, or to reset passwords for other services.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for logging into computers. This leaves employee workstations vulnerable to unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or guessed. Compromised workstations can serve as a pivot point for attackers to move laterally within the network, access internal resources, and deploy malware.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network access points</li></ul>

                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for accessing sensitive data systems. This is a critical vulnerability, as it means that a single compromised password could grant an attacker access to the organization's most valuable and protected information. The impact of such a breach could be severe, including regulatory fines, loss of intellectual property, and severe reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Critical business applications</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Recurring Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual training for all employees. Security threats evolve constantly, and without regular updates, employees may become complacent or unaware of new attack vectors (e.g., advanced phishing techniques, social engineering). This increases the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediate action is required to address the critical vulnerability of the exposed 'TOP SECRET DB' on port 8080; this service should be immediately secured, moved behind a firewall, or taken offline until proper security controls are implemented. The organization must implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, including email systems, computer logins, and especially sensitive data systems, to significantly enhance credential security. Furthermore, a comprehensive and recurring security awareness training program should be established for all employees, conducted at least annually, to ensure they are continuously updated on evolving cyber threats and best practices. Regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing should also be performed to identify and remediate other potential weaknesses.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant security risks, primarily due to an exposed sensitive database and a pervasive lack of multi-factor authentication across critical access points. While some foundational security practices like an acceptable use policy and new employee training are in place, the absence of recurring security awareness training and robust authentication mechanisms leaves the organization highly susceptible to data breaches and unauthorized access. Addressing these critical and high-severity vulnerabilities is paramount to improving the overall security posture and protecting sensitive assets.</p>
