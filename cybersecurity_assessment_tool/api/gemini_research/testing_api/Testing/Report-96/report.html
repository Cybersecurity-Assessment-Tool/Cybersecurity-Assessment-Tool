        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's current security posture indicates significant vulnerabilities, primarily due to a lack of fundamental security controls and policies. There is no Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) required for critical access points such as email, computer logins, or sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy, which is crucial for guiding employee behavior regarding IT resource usage. While new employees receive security awareness training, there is no annual training for all employees, leading to potential degradation of security knowledge over time. These gaps expose the organization to a high risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and operational disruptions.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access, computer login, or sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or malware. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to critical systems and data, leading to data breaches, financial loss, and reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email systems</li><li>User login accounts (computers)</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This means there are no formal guidelines or rules for employees regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, internet, email, and data. This absence can lead to misuse of company assets, exposure to malware, data leakage, and non-compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, as employees may unknowingly or knowingly engage in risky behaviors.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Network infrastructure</li><li>Data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Infrequent Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, all employees do not receive it at least once per year. This infrequent training schedule means employees may not be up-to-date on the latest threats, best practices, and company policies. Over time, security knowledge degrades, increasing susceptibility to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing), malware, and other human-factor vulnerabilities, thereby weakening the organization's overall security posture.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li><li>Data integrity</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, as a top priority. Concurrently, develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy that clearly outlines guidelines for the appropriate use of company IT resources and data. Furthermore, establish a mandatory, annual security awareness training program for all employees to ensure continuous education on current threats and best practices, reinforcing a strong security culture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces critical and high-severity vulnerabilities due to the absence of MFA, a formal acceptable use policy, and insufficient security awareness training. Its readiness against common cyber threats is low, making it highly susceptible to unauthorized access and data breaches. Immediate action on the recommended security controls is essential to mitigate these risks and improve the overall cybersecurity posture.</p>
