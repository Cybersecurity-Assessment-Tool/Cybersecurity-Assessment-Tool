        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, and by having an acceptable use policy and initial security awareness training for new employees. However, critical gaps exist in the protection of sensitive data systems and the ongoing education of its workforce. The absence of MFA for sensitive data systems and the lack of annual security awareness training for all employees represent significant vulnerabilities that could be exploited, leading to potential data breaches and compromised security posture.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Multi-Factor Authentication for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or other means. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to sensitive data, leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Recurring Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. While new employees receive training, the lack of recurring training means that existing employees may not be updated on the latest threats, best practices, and organizational policies. This oversight can lead to a decline in security posture over time, making employees more susceptible to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting), malware, and other human-factor vulnerabilities.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li><li>Data integrity</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems. This critical step will add an essential layer of security, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access even if primary credentials are compromised. Furthermore, the organization must establish and enforce a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees. This recurring training should cover current threat landscapes, social engineering tactics, data handling best practices, and organizational security policies to ensure that the entire workforce remains vigilant and informed against evolving cyber threats. Regular updates to the training content are also advised to reflect new risks and technologies.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently exhibits a mixed security readiness posture. While some essential security controls like MFA for email and computer logins, and initial employee training are in place, the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems and the lack of annual security awareness training for the entire workforce present critical vulnerabilities. Addressing these specific areas is paramount to enhancing the overall security posture, protecting sensitive information, and reducing the likelihood of successful cyberattacks. Proactive implementation of the recommended measures will significantly improve the organization's resilience against current and future threats.</p>
