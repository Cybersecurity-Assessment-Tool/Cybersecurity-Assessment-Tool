            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The network scan data provided was minimal, indicating no open ports on the scanned hosts, which suggests either a highly secured external perimeter or an incomplete scan. However, the organizational data reveals significant procedural and policy gaps that pose substantial cybersecurity risks. The organization currently does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access, computer logins, or sensitive data systems. Furthermore, there is no employee acceptable use policy in place, and while new employees receive security awareness training, there is no annual training for all employees.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for critical access points including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or malware. A single compromised password could grant an attacker access to critical organizational resources, leading to data breaches, system compromise, and potential financial and reputational damage.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Email systems",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)",
                        "Overview": "The organization lacks a formal Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) for employees. Without clear guidelines on the appropriate use of company IT resources, internet access, and data handling, employees may inadvertently or intentionally engage in activities that pose security risks. This can include installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive information, increasing the organization's exposure to malware, data leakage, and compliance issues.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Insufficient Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "While new employees receive security awareness training, there is no mandatory annual training for all employees. This leaves the organization vulnerable to evolving cyber threats as employees may not be updated on the latest phishing techniques, social engineering tactics, or best practices for data protection. A lack of ongoing training increases the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents, such as clicking malicious links, falling for social engineering scams, or mishandling sensitive information.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "Email systems",
                            "Internal network"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, including email systems, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. A comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) should be developed, communicated, and enforced for all employees to establish clear guidelines for IT resource usage and data handling. Furthermore, a mandatory annual security awareness training program must be established for all employees to ensure they are continuously updated on current cyber threats and best practices. Regular, comprehensive network vulnerability scans and penetration tests should also be conducted to identify and address any technical weaknesses.",
            "Conclusion": "While the provided network scan data did not reveal immediate technical vulnerabilities, the assessment of organizational policies and practices highlights significant security gaps. The absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for critical systems, lack of an Acceptable Use Policy, and insufficient ongoing security awareness training collectively place the organization at a high risk of data breaches and system compromise. The organization's current readiness is low due to these fundamental security control deficiencies, necessitating urgent action to implement robust procedural and technical safeguards."
