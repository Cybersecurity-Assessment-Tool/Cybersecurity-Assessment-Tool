        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and access to sensitive data systems. However, a significant gap exists in securing email access, as MFA is not required. Furthermore, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees, which are critical components of a robust security posture. The network scan data provided indicates no open ports on the scanned hosts, suggesting a basic level of external network hygiene, though this is a limited view.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Email is a primary vector for phishing and account compromise. Without MFA, a stolen or phished password is sufficient for an attacker to gain access to an employee's email account. This can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and serve as a pivot point for further attacks within the organization's network. This vulnerability was identified through the organization's self-reported security practices.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>User accounts</li><li>Organizational data accessible via email</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Without a formal acceptable use policy, employees may not be aware of the organization's expectations regarding the use of IT resources, data handling, and internet browsing. This lack of clear guidelines increases the risk of employees unknowingly engaging in activities that could introduce malware, expose sensitive data, or violate compliance requirements. This vulnerability was identified through the organization's self-reported security practices.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network resources</li><li>IT systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the absence of regular, annual training means that employees may not be updated on evolving threats, new organizational policies, or best practices. This increases the organization's susceptibility to social engineering attacks, phishing campaigns, and other human-centric security incidents over time, as initial training knowledge may degrade or become outdated. This vulnerability was identified through the organization's self-reported security practices.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network security</li><li>Incident response readiness</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts to significantly reduce the risk of account compromise. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy that clearly outlines expectations for IT resource usage, data handling, and security protocols. Furthermore, establish a program for mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees to ensure they remain informed about current threats and best practices, reinforcing a strong security culture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization has made progress in securing access to computers and sensitive data systems with MFA. However, critical vulnerabilities exist concerning email security, employee policy, and ongoing security awareness training. Addressing these areas is paramount to enhancing the overall security posture, reducing the attack surface, and building a more resilient defense against common cyber threats.</p>
