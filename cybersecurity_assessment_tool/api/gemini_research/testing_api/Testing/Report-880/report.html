        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a strong foundational security posture with no open ports identified during the network scan, indicating a well-secured perimeter. Internally, the organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, significantly enhancing access control. Furthermore, regular security awareness training for both new and existing employees is in place, which is crucial for fostering a security-conscious culture. However, a notable gap exists in the absence of an employee acceptable use policy.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Missing Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy. This absence creates a significant risk as it leaves employees without clear guidelines regarding the appropriate use of company assets, networks, and data. Without an AUP, there is an increased likelihood of misuse of company resources, unauthorized data access or sharing, and engagement in activities that could expose the organization to legal liabilities, data breaches, or reputational damage. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data provided, which explicitly stated 'Does your organization have an employee acceptable use policy?':'No'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Company IT assets</li><li>Legal and compliance posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>It is strongly recommended that the organization develop and implement a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) without delay. This policy should clearly define acceptable and unacceptable uses of company IT resources, data, and networks, including guidelines on internet usage, email, software installation, data handling, and personal device usage. Once developed, the AUP must be formally communicated to all employees, and acknowledgment of understanding and compliance should be obtained. Regular reviews and updates to the AUP should also be scheduled to ensure it remains relevant with evolving technology and organizational needs. Integrating the AUP into existing security awareness training programs will reinforce its importance and ensure consistent understanding.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Overall, the organization exhibits a commendable level of security readiness, particularly with its robust MFA implementation across critical access points and consistent security awareness training. The absence of open network ports further strengthens its external defense. However, the lack of an Employee Acceptable Use Policy represents a significant internal vulnerability that could undermine these strengths by introducing human-factor risks. Addressing this policy gap is crucial for establishing clear behavioral boundaries and mitigating potential internal threats, thereby solidifying the organization's overall security posture.</p>
