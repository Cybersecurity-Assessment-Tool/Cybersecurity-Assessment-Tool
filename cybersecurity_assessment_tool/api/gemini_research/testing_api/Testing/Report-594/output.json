        {
            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to security with widespread Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) implementation for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. Regular security awareness training is conducted for all employees, including new hires. A notable area for improvement is the absence of an employee acceptable use policy. While network scans indicate that common web ports are closed, a specific vulnerability regarding an unencrypted web server has been identified through a security assessment.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Unencrypted Web Server",
                        "Overview": "Port 80 is open. This exposes unencrypted traffic, potentially allowing sensitive information to be intercepted. This vulnerability was identified through a security assessment.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Port 80"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "It is recommended to immediately address the unencrypted web server vulnerability by ensuring Port 80 is closed and implementing SSL/TLS encryption for all web traffic. Furthermore, the organization should develop and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to clearly define expected behavior and responsibilities regarding company assets and data.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization has a solid foundation in place with strong MFA adoption and consistent security awareness training. However, the absence of an employee acceptable use policy represents a significant governance gap. Additionally, the identified unencrypted web server poses a risk of data exposure, requiring immediate attention to secure web communications. Addressing these areas will further enhance the organization's overall security posture and readiness."
