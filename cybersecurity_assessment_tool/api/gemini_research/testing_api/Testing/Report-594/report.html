        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to security with widespread Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) implementation for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. Regular security awareness training is conducted for all employees, including new hires. A notable area for improvement is the absence of an employee acceptable use policy. While network scans indicate that common web ports are closed, a specific vulnerability regarding an unencrypted web server has been identified through a security assessment.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unencrypted Web Server - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Port 80 is open. This exposes unencrypted traffic, potentially allowing sensitive information to be intercepted. This vulnerability was identified through a security assessment.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>It is recommended to immediately address the unencrypted web server vulnerability by ensuring Port 80 is closed and implementing SSL/TLS encryption for all web traffic. Furthermore, the organization should develop and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to clearly define expected behavior and responsibilities regarding company assets and data.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization has a solid foundation in place with strong MFA adoption and consistent security awareness training. However, the absence of an employee acceptable use policy represents a significant governance gap. Additionally, the identified unencrypted web server poses a risk of data exposure, requiring immediate attention to secure web communications. Addressing these areas will further enhance the organization's overall security posture and readiness.</p>
