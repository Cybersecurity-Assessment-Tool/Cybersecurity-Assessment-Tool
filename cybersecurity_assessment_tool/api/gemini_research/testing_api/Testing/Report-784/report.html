        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Based on the provided Nmap scan, the network appears to have no immediately identifiable open ports, indicating a potentially locked-down external perimeter or a very basic internal scan. However, a comprehensive assessment of the organization's security posture reveals significant gaps in foundational security practices, particularly concerning multi-factor authentication (MFA), employee policies, and security awareness training. These deficiencies pose substantial internal and external risks to data integrity, confidentiality, and availability.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for employees to log into their computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen, phished, or brute-forced. Without a second factor, a compromised password is often sufficient for an attacker to gain access to an endpoint, potentially leading to lateral movement and data exfiltration. This was identified through the organizational data indicating "Do you require MFA to log into computers?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Servers</li><li>Network devices requiring login</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not mandated for accessing sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access should an attacker compromise a single set of credentials. Sensitive data systems often contain personally identifiable information (PII), financial records, or intellectual property, making them prime targets. The absence of MFA on these systems dramatically increases the potential impact of a breach. This was identified through the organizational data indicating "Do you require MFA to access sensitive data systems?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Databases</li><li>File shares</li><li>CRM systems</li><li>ERP systems</li><li>Cloud storage containing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy (AUP). An AUP is crucial for setting clear expectations for employees regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, data, and internet access. Without such a policy, employees may unknowingly engage in risky behaviors (e.g., visiting malicious websites, installing unauthorized software, sharing sensitive information inappropriately), leading to security incidents, data breaches, or compliance violations. This was identified through the organizational data indicating "Does your organization have an employee acceptable use policy?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT assets</li><li>Network resources</li><li>Data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training. This means that individuals new to the organization may not be aware of common cyber threats (e.g., phishing, social engineering), company security policies, or best practices for protecting sensitive information from day one. This oversight creates a significant window of vulnerability where new hires could inadvertently introduce risks or fall victim to attacks before they are properly educated. This was identified through the organizational data indicating "Does your organization do security awareness training for new employees?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Company data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. Regular training is essential to keep employees informed about evolving threats, reinforce security best practices, and ensure compliance with policies. Without annual training, employees' security knowledge can degrade over time, making them more susceptible to sophisticated attacks and increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents. This was identified through the organizational data indicating "Does your organization do security awareness training for all employees at least once per year?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and, critically, for access to all sensitive data systems. This will provide a robust layer of defense against credential theft. Furthermore, the organization must develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to guide appropriate behavior and mitigate insider risks. Concurrently, a mandatory security awareness training program should be established, including initial training for all new employees and annual refresher training for the entire workforce. These measures will foster a security-conscious culture and significantly reduce the likelihood and impact of human-factor related security incidents.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the provided network scan data did not reveal immediate technical vulnerabilities, the organizational data highlights a critical lack of foundational security controls and practices. The absence of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, coupled with the complete lack of an acceptable use policy and comprehensive security awareness training, indicates a low state of readiness against common cyber threats. The organization is highly vulnerable to credential-based attacks, social engineering, and insider threats due to these significant policy and training gaps. Addressing these areas is paramount to establishing a baseline level of cybersecurity resilience.</p>
