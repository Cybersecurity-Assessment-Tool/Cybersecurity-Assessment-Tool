        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open MySQL port (3306) running version 5.7.33, indicating a potential database exposure. From an organizational security posture perspective, the company has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems, and conducts annual security awareness training for all employees, along with having an acceptable use policy. However, there is a notable gap in requiring MFA for computer logins and providing security awareness training for new employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is openly accessible on the network. This exposure allows potential attackers to attempt to connect to the database, which could lead to unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or data manipulation if vulnerabilities are exploited or weak credentials are used. This was identified through a network port scan revealing the open port and service.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted IP addresses or internal networks. For a long-term solution, consider placing the database behind a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or implementing a more robust access control mechanism. Furthermore, enhance the organization's overall security posture by mandating Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised. Finally, establish and enforce a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees to ensure they are equipped with essential cybersecurity knowledge from day one.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces a significant vulnerability due to an openly exposed MySQL database port, which poses a high risk of unauthorized data access. While the organization demonstrates some maturity in security practices, such as MFA for email and sensitive data, and annual security training, the lack of MFA for computer logins and initial security training for new employees represents critical gaps. Addressing these vulnerabilities and implementing the recommended security controls is crucial to enhancing the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and protecting its sensitive assets.</p>
