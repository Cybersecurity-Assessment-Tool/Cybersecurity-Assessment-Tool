        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security awareness through regular training and an acceptable use policy. However, critical gaps exist in identity and access management, specifically the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins. While MFA is implemented for sensitive data systems, its lack in other key areas significantly elevates the risk of unauthorized access. Furthermore, the network scan identified an outdated Nginx web server, which poses a significant vulnerability due to unpatched security flaws.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for email access. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. Compromised email accounts can lead to further attacks, data breaches, and business email compromise (BEC) scams.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee email accounts</li><li>Email infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for logging into computers. This leaves employee workstations vulnerable to unauthorized access if login credentials are stolen or guessed. A compromised workstation can provide an attacker with access to internal networks, sensitive data, and the ability to launch further attacks.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Internal network access</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Nginx Web Server - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The network scan identified an Nginx web server running version 1.18.0. This version is outdated and has reached its end-of-life, meaning it no longer receives security updates or patches for newly discovered vulnerabilities. Running outdated software exposes the organization to known security flaws that attackers can exploit to gain unauthorized access, disrupt services, or compromise data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Web server (nginx 1.18.0)</li><li>Port 443</li><li>Associated web applications</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and computer logins across the organization. This will significantly enhance protection against credential-based attacks. Additionally, the Nginx web server running version 1.18.0 must be updated to a currently supported and patched version immediately to address known vulnerabilities and ensure ongoing security. Regular patch management and software lifecycle reviews should be established to prevent similar issues in the future.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has a good foundation in security awareness training and acceptable use policies, its current readiness is significantly hampered by critical vulnerabilities related to identity and access management and outdated software. The absence of MFA for email and computer logins, coupled with an end-of-life web server, presents substantial attack vectors that could lead to unauthorized access and data breaches. Addressing these high-severity risks is paramount to improving the organization's overall cybersecurity posture.</p>
