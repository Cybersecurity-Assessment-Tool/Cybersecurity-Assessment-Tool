        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, and providing initial security awareness training for new employees. However, critical gaps exist in protecting sensitive data systems, establishing clear employee conduct guidelines, and maintaining ongoing security awareness for all staff. Due to broken input data, a detailed network summary based on scan data is not available.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if credentials are compromised through phishing, malware, or other means. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to sensitive data, leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and reputational damage. This was identified through the organizational data indicating "Do you require MFA to access sensitive data systems?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy (AUP). An AUP is crucial for defining acceptable and unacceptable behavior regarding the use of organizational IT resources, data, and networks. Without a clear AUP, employees may inadvertently or intentionally engage in activities that pose security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive information. This absence can lead to increased exposure to malware, data leakage, and legal liabilities. This was identified through the organizational data indicating "Does your organization have an employee acceptable use policy?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational IT resources</li><li>Network infrastructure</li><li>Data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Recurring Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. Cybersecurity threats evolve rapidly, and without regular updates and reinforcement, employees' awareness of current threats (e.g., new phishing techniques, social engineering tactics) and best practices can diminish over time. This increases the likelihood of employees falling victim to attacks, thereby compromising organizational security. This was identified through the organizational data indicating "Does your organization do security awareness training for all employees at least once per year?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network security</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems immediately. This critical step will significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access even if user credentials are compromised. Concurrently, develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy (AUP) that clearly outlines expectations for IT resource usage, data handling, and online conduct. This policy should be communicated to all employees and acknowledged. Furthermore, establish a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees, ensuring that training content is updated regularly to reflect current threat landscapes and best practices. These measures will collectively strengthen the organization's defenses against common cyber threats and foster a more security-conscious culture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently exhibits a mixed security readiness level. While strong controls are in place for email and computer login MFA, and initial employee training is provided, significant vulnerabilities remain. The absence of MFA for sensitive data systems, the lack of an acceptable use policy, and the infrequent nature of security awareness training for the entire workforce expose the organization to considerable risks, including data breaches and operational disruptions. Addressing these identified gaps through the recommended actions is crucial for improving overall cybersecurity resilience and protecting critical assets.</p>
