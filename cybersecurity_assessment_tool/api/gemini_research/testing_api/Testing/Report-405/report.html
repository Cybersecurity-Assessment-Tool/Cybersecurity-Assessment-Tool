        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open port 8080, which was identified as a 'TOP SECRET DB'. However, further analysis indicated this was a false positive and the port is considered secure. Organizational data indicates that while Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required for email and sensitive data systems, it is not enforced for computer logins. Furthermore, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or annual training for all employees. These policy and training gaps represent significant areas of concern for the organization's overall security posture.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if employee credentials are stolen, phished, or brute-forced. Without a second factor, a compromised password alone grants an attacker access to the internal network and potentially sensitive systems, facilitating lateral movement and data exfiltration. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers</li><li>User accounts</li><li>Internal network access</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This absence means there are no formal guidelines or expectations for employees regarding the proper use of company IT resources, data, and network access. This can lead to inconsistent security practices, increased risk of data misuse or accidental exposure, and potential non-compliance with regulatory requirements. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT assets</li><li>Company data</li><li>Network resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) as they may be less familiar with company security protocols, common threats, and internal reporting procedures. This significantly increases the risk of a successful initial compromise through human error, potentially leading to malware infections, credential theft, or data breaches. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Company data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li><li>Email systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Ongoing Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not provide annual security awareness training for all employees. Without regular training, employees may not be kept up-to-date on evolving cyber threats, new company policies, and best practices for protecting sensitive information. This leads to a degradation of security knowledge over time, increasing the likelihood of human-factor incidents such as falling for phishing scams, mishandling sensitive data, or introducing malware into the environment. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li><li>Email systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to enhance access control and prevent unauthorized access from compromised credentials. A comprehensive employee acceptable use policy should be developed and formally communicated to all staff, outlining clear guidelines for IT resource usage and data handling. Furthermore, a mandatory security awareness training program must be established for all new employees upon onboarding, covering essential cybersecurity principles and company-specific protocols. This initial training should be supplemented with mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees to ensure ongoing vigilance against evolving threats and to reinforce best practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the network scan did not reveal any critical technical vulnerabilities, the organization's current readiness is significantly hampered by critical gaps in its security policies and employee training programs. The absence of MFA for computer logins, an acceptable use policy, and comprehensive security awareness training for both new and existing employees exposes the organization to a high risk of human-factor incidents, unauthorized access, and potential data breaches. Addressing these foundational security elements is paramount to improving the overall cybersecurity posture and reducing the attack surface.</p>
