        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Based on the provided data, the organization has an open SSH port (22) and several critical gaps in its security posture, particularly concerning Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), employee policies, and security awareness training. While MFA is used for email, it is absent for computer logins and sensitive data systems. The lack of an acceptable use policy and any form of security awareness training for employees significantly increases the organization's attack surface and risk of human-factor incidents.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port (22) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An Nmap scan identified an open SSH port (22) on a host within the network. While SSH is a legitimate service, an open port represents a potential entry point for attackers if not properly secured with strong authentication, rate limiting, and regular patching. Unauthorized access could lead to data breaches, system compromise, or lateral movement within the network.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with port 22 open</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if employee credentials are stolen or compromised through phishing, malware, or brute-force attacks. Without a second factor, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to a user's workstation and potentially the internal network.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers</li><li>User authentication systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk, as compromised credentials could allow unauthorized individuals direct access to confidential information, leading to severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and significant reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases storing sensitive information</li><li>Cloud storage for sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy (AUP). Without a clear AUP, employees may be unaware of their responsibilities regarding company assets, data handling, internet usage, and security best practices. This can lead to increased risks such as data leakage, malware infections from unapproved software or websites, and non-compliance with internal security standards.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li><li>Data handling procedures</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) as they may be less familiar with company policies, systems, and common threats. This lack of initial training leaves the organization vulnerable to human-factor exploits from the moment an employee joins.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational susceptibility to social engineering</li><li>Initial onboarding process</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Annual Security Awareness Training for All Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not provide annual security awareness training for all employees. Regular training is crucial to keep employees informed about evolving threats, reinforce security best practices, and maintain a strong security culture. Without it, employees may forget previous training, become complacent, or be unaware of new attack vectors, increasing the likelihood of successful phishing, malware, or social engineering attacks.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational susceptibility to social engineering</li><li>Ongoing security culture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, the organization should immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and, critically, for all sensitive data systems. This is a fundamental step to protect against credential compromise. Furthermore, a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy must be developed and enforced to clearly define expected behavior regarding company resources and data. Concurrently, a robust security awareness training program should be established, including mandatory training for all new employees during onboarding and annual refresher training for all staff. For the open SSH port, it is recommended to review its necessity, restrict access to only authorized IP addresses, enforce strong password policies or key-based authentication, and ensure the SSH server is regularly patched and configured with secure defaults (e.g., disabling root login, changing default port). Regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing should also be conducted to identify and address further weaknesses proactively.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to a lack of foundational security controls and employee awareness programs. While MFA is in place for email, its absence for computer logins and sensitive data systems, coupled with the complete lack of an acceptable use policy and security awareness training, creates a highly vulnerable environment. The presence of an open SSH port further highlights the need for a comprehensive review of network configurations. Addressing these critical gaps through the implementation of MFA, policy development, and ongoing security education is paramount to enhancing the organization's overall security posture and readiness against modern cyber threats.</p>
