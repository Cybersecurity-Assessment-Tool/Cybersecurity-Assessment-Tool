        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. An employee acceptable use policy is also in place, and new employees receive security awareness training. However, a network scan identified an open SSH port (22), and a critical gap was noted in the organization's security awareness program: annual training is not provided to all employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port Exposure - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An Nmap scan revealed that port 22 (SSH) is open on a host within the network. While SSH is a legitimate and often necessary service for remote administration, an open port increases the attack surface. Without proper hardening, such as strong authentication, IP restrictions, and up-to-date software, this port could be vulnerable to brute-force attacks, unauthorized access, or exploitation of known vulnerabilities in the SSH server software.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 22</li><li>Network host(s) with open SSH</li><li>Remote access infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. While new employees receive initial training, the lack of ongoing, annual education significantly increases the risk of successful social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting), malware infections, and data breaches due to human error. Employees who are not regularly updated on current threats and best practices are more susceptible to falling victim to sophisticated cyberattacks, making the human element a potential weak link in the security posture.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li><li>Overall security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization implement the following measures: For the open SSH port, ensure that strong authentication methods (e.g., key-based authentication, disabling password authentication) are enforced, implement rate limiting, restrict access to trusted IP addresses via firewall rules, and ensure the SSH server software is regularly updated and patched. Additionally, consider changing the default SSH port to a non-standard one to reduce automated scanning attempts. Critically, the organization must establish and enforce mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees. This training should cover current threat landscapes, including advanced phishing techniques, social engineering tactics, strong password practices, secure data handling, and incident reporting procedures, to significantly enhance the 'human firewall' against cyber threats.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization has established a commendable baseline with robust MFA implementation across critical systems and an acceptable use policy. However, the presence of an exposed SSH port and, more significantly, the absence of annual security awareness training for all employees represent notable vulnerabilities. Addressing these areas, particularly the human element through consistent training, is paramount to strengthening the overall cybersecurity posture, reducing the attack surface, and improving the organization's readiness against evolving cyber threats.</p>
