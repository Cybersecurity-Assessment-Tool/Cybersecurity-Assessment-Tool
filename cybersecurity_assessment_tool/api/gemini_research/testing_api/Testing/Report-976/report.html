        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization currently lacks fundamental security controls, particularly regarding Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across critical access points including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. While network scans did not reveal open ports, indicating a basic level of perimeter security, the internal security posture is significantly weakened by the absence of these crucial authentication mechanisms. Furthermore, the organization operates without an employee acceptable use policy and does not provide security awareness training for new employees, leaving it vulnerable to human-factor risks and internal policy gaps. Annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees, which is a positive step, but it is insufficient to cover the initial onboarding period for new hires or to compensate for the lack of foundational security policies and technical controls.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access significantly increases the risk of account compromise. Without MFA, a single stolen or guessed password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's email, leading to potential business email compromise (BEC), phishing attacks against other employees, data exfiltration, and further network penetration. This vulnerability was identified through the 'Org Data' indicating no MFA requirement for email.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee email accounts</li><li>Email server/service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This exposes employee workstations and potentially the internal network to unauthorized access if credentials are compromised through phishing, malware, or brute-force attacks. An attacker gaining access to a local machine can perform lateral movement, access local resources, and escalate privileges. This vulnerability was identified through the 'Org Data' indicating no MFA requirement for computer logins.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee workstations</li><li>Domain controllers (if applicable)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Access to systems containing sensitive data without Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) represents a critical security gap. A single compromised credential could allow an unauthorized individual to access, modify, or exfiltrate confidential information, leading to severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, significant financial penalties, and severe reputational damage. This vulnerability was identified through the 'Org Data' indicating no MFA requirement for sensitive data systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All systems storing or processing sensitive data (e.g., CRM, ERP, HR systems, databases)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines, employees may unknowingly engage in activities that pose security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, sharing sensitive information inappropriately, or mishandling company data. This absence increases the attack surface, introduces potential for insider threats, and makes it difficult to enforce security best practices. This vulnerability was identified through the 'Org Data' indicating no acceptable use policy.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees are not provided with initial security awareness training. This makes them particularly susceptible to social engineering attacks, such as phishing and pretexting, due to their unfamiliarity with organizational security protocols, common threats, and internal reporting procedures. A new employee falling victim to such an attack could inadvertently compromise the organization's security posture. This vulnerability was identified through the 'Org Data' indicating no security awareness training for new employees.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, immediate implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is strongly recommended for all email accounts, computer logins, and especially for access to sensitive data systems. This is the most critical step to mitigate credential-based attacks. Concurrently, a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy should be developed, communicated, and enforced to establish clear guidelines for secure behavior. Furthermore, a mandatory security awareness training program must be introduced for all new employees as part of their onboarding process, complementing the existing annual training for all staff. These measures will address the identified vulnerabilities by strengthening authentication, establishing clear behavioral expectations, and educating the workforce against common cyber threats.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant security risks primarily due to the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication across critical access points and a lack of foundational security policies and training for new employees. While external network scans show a closed perimeter, the internal security readiness is low, leaving the organization highly vulnerable to credential compromise, social engineering, and insider threats. Addressing these fundamental gaps through the implementation of MFA, an acceptable use policy, and comprehensive new employee security training is paramount to improving the overall cybersecurity posture and protecting organizational assets.</p>
