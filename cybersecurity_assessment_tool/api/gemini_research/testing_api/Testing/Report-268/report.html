        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Based on the provided network scan data, no active hosts or open ports were identified, suggesting either a highly secured external perimeter or an incomplete scan. Internally, the organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and conducts annual security awareness training for all employees, alongside having an acceptable use policy. However, there are notable gaps in security posture regarding MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, as well as a lack of security awareness training for new employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised through phishing, malware, or brute-force attacks. Without a second factor, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's workstation and potentially the internal network. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Internal network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk to data confidentiality and integrity. If an attacker gains access to credentials for these systems, they can directly access, exfiltrate, or tamper with sensitive organizational data without an additional layer of security. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>Cloud storage containing sensitive information</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees upon onboarding. This leaves new hires vulnerable to common social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) and unaware of organizational security policies and best practices from day one. This oversight can introduce significant human-factor vulnerabilities into the organization's security posture, as new employees are often targeted by attackers. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security culture</li><li>Overall human attack surface</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and, critically, for access to all sensitive data systems. This will significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access even if primary credentials are compromised. Furthermore, a comprehensive security awareness training program should be established for all new employees as part of their onboarding process, ensuring they are equipped with essential security knowledge and best practices from day one. Regular, engaging training should also continue for all employees annually, reinforcing a strong security culture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security with MFA for email, an acceptable use policy, and annual security awareness training. However, significant vulnerabilities exist due to the absence of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, alongside a critical gap in security awareness training for new employees. Addressing these areas is paramount to bolstering the organization's readiness against common cyber threats and protecting its sensitive assets.</p>
