        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of cybersecurity best practices by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems, and maintaining robust security awareness training programs for both new and existing employees. An acceptable use policy is also in place. However, a significant gap exists in endpoint security, specifically regarding computer login authentication.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for employees to log into their computers. This poses a significant risk as it allows for single-factor authentication, making systems highly susceptible to credential-based attacks such as phishing, brute-force, and password spraying. If an attacker compromises a user's password, they would gain direct access to the workstation and potentially the internal network without an additional layer of security. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee workstations</li><li>Internal network access points</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>It is strongly recommended to implement mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins across the organization. This should be enforced through Group Policy Objects (GPOs) or equivalent endpoint management solutions. The organization should evaluate and deploy a robust MFA solution that integrates seamlessly with existing identity providers and operating systems. Additionally, a comprehensive review of all access policies should be conducted to ensure MFA is consistently applied to all critical access points. Clear communication and training should be provided to all employees regarding the new MFA requirement for computer logins to ensure a smooth transition and user adoption.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization has established a good baseline for security with MFA for critical systems and regular security awareness training. However, the absence of MFA for computer logins represents a critical vulnerability that significantly elevates the risk of unauthorized access to endpoints and the internal network. Addressing this gap is paramount to enhancing the overall security posture and readiness against modern cyber threats.</p>
