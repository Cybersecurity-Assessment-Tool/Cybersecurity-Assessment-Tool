        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network posture, as assessed through provided organizational data, indicates a foundational understanding of some security practices, such as having an acceptable use policy and conducting security awareness training for new employees. However, critical gaps exist in multi-factor authentication (MFA) implementation across key access points and in the frequency of ongoing security awareness training for the entire workforce. Due to broken network scan data, a detailed technical assessment of network vulnerabilities could not be performed.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts through phishing, brute-force attacks, or compromised credentials. Without MFA, a single stolen password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's communication, potentially leading to further compromise of internal systems or data exfiltration. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA requirement for email.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system access</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This exposes endpoints to a higher risk of unauthorized access if user credentials are stolen or guessed. An attacker gaining access to a computer can potentially move laterally within the network, access sensitive data, or deploy malware. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA requirement for computer login.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network endpoints</li><li>User login processes</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This is a critical vulnerability as it means that access to the most valuable organizational assets is protected only by a single factor (e.g., a password). If these credentials are compromised, attackers can gain direct access to sensitive information, leading to data breaches, regulatory fines, and reputational damage. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA requirement for sensitive data systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>Cloud storage with sensitive data</li><li>Access control mechanisms</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Recurring Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. While new employees receive initial training, the lack of regular, recurring training means that employees may not be kept up-to-date on the latest threats, best practices, and organizational policies. This increases the risk of human error leading to security incidents, such as falling for phishing scams, mishandling sensitive data, or using weak passwords. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for annual security awareness training for all employees.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security culture</li><li>Incident prevention programs</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, including email systems, computer logins, and especially sensitive data systems. This single measure will drastically reduce the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials. Furthermore, establishing a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees is crucial. This will ensure that the entire workforce remains informed about evolving cyber threats and best practices, reinforcing a strong security culture and reducing the likelihood of human-factor incidents.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant vulnerabilities primarily due to the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. While an acceptable use policy and new employee training are in place, the lack of recurring annual security awareness training for all employees represents a gap in maintaining a consistently vigilant workforce. Without addressing these fundamental security controls, the organization remains highly susceptible to credential-based attacks and human-error-driven security incidents. The overall readiness is moderate, with critical improvements needed in identity and access management and continuous employee education.</p>
