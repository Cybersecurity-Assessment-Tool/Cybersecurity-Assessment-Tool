        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently operates an FTP server (vsftpd 2.3.4) that permits anonymous login, posing a significant data exposure risk. Internally, there is a critical lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across key systems including email, computer logins, and sensitive data access, leaving the organization highly vulnerable to credential-based attacks. Furthermore, workstations are running Windows 7, an end-of-life operating system, which is no longer receiving security updates and is susceptible to known exploits. The absence of an employee acceptable use policy also introduces potential for misuse of IT resources. Positively, the organization does conduct security awareness training for both new and existing employees annually, which is a good foundation for improving human-factor security.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Anonymous FTP Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The FTP server (vsftpd version 2.3.4) is configured to allow anonymous login. This configuration can lead to unauthorized access to files, potential data leakage, or even server compromise if write permissions are misconfigured. This vulnerability was identified through an Nmap scan that successfully performed an anonymous FTP login.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>FTP server (vsftpd 2.3.4)</li><li>Port 21</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email, logging into computers, or accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access in the event of compromised or stolen credentials, as a single factor (password) is the only barrier to entry for critical systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email systems</li><li>User login systems</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines on the appropriate use of company IT resources, employees may inadvertently or intentionally engage in activities that pose security risks, lead to data breaches, or create legal liabilities for the organization.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>IT resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Windows Policy - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Several workstations within the organization are running Windows 7, an operating system that has reached its end-of-life. This means these systems no longer receive critical security updates, making them highly vulnerable to known exploits and newly discovered threats, significantly increasing the risk of malware infection and system compromise.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately disable anonymous access on the FTP server and implement strong authentication mechanisms, or ideally, transition to a more secure protocol like SFTP or FTPS. A critical priority should be the implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access, computer logins, and sensitive data systems to significantly enhance protection against credential theft. The organization must also develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to guide appropriate behavior regarding IT resource usage. For the outdated Windows 7 workstations, an urgent upgrade to a currently supported operating system like Windows 10 or 11 is essential to ensure systems receive vital security updates and patches. While security awareness training is already in place, consider incorporating specific modules addressing these new policies and the importance of MFA.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several critical and high-severity vulnerabilities, primarily stemming from the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication across key systems, the presence of an anonymously accessible FTP server, and the continued use of end-of-life Windows 7 workstations. While security awareness training is a positive aspect of the current posture, the absence of fundamental security controls and policies leaves the organization highly susceptible to unauthorized access, data breaches, and system compromise. Addressing these issues with urgency is paramount to improving the overall cybersecurity readiness and reducing the attack surface.</p>
