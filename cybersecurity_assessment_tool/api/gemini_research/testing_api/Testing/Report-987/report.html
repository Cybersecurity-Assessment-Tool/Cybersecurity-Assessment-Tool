        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an active MySQL database service (version 5.7.33) with port 3306 open. This indicates a potential direct exposure of the database to the network. Furthermore, an assessment of organizational practices highlighted significant security gaps. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required for computer logins, it is notably absent for email and sensitive data systems. Critical foundational security policies and training are also lacking, specifically an employee acceptable use policy and any form of security awareness training for both new and existing employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network. This exposes the database service (MySQL 5.7.33) to potential unauthorized access or attacks, especially if not properly secured with strong authentication and access controls. An attacker could potentially exploit known vulnerabilities in this version or attempt brute-force attacks to gain access to sensitive data stored within the database.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access email. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks. If an attacker gains access to an employee's email, it could lead to further compromise of other systems, data exfiltration, or business email compromise (BEC) scams.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are compromised. Without MFA, a single stolen password could grant an attacker full access to sensitive information, leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and severe reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines, employees may engage in activities that inadvertently introduce security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling company data. This absence creates a significant governance gap and increases the likelihood of insider threats or accidental data exposure.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data and systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or annual training for all employees. This leaves the workforce unprepared to identify and respond to common cyber threats like phishing, social engineering, and malware. A lack of security awareness is a primary factor in successful cyberattacks, as employees often represent the weakest link in an organization's security posture.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data and systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement robust firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted internal IP addresses or via a secure VPN. Furthermore, immediate deployment of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and sensitive data systems is crucial to prevent unauthorized access. The organization must also develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to establish clear guidelines for technology usage. Concurrently, a mandatory security awareness training program should be established for all new hires and conducted annually for all employees to educate them on current cyber threats and best security practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity vulnerabilities, primarily stemming from an exposed database service, critical gaps in Multi-Factor Authentication implementation for email and sensitive data, and a complete absence of foundational security policies and employee training. These weaknesses collectively indicate a low level of cybersecurity readiness, making the organization highly susceptible to data breaches, unauthorized access, and operational disruption. Addressing these issues through the recommended technical controls and policy implementations is paramount to improving the overall security posture.</p>
