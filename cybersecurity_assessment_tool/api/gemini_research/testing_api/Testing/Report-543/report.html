        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes a MySQL database service on port 3306. While the organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and sensitive data systems, and has an acceptable use policy and security awareness training for new employees, there are notable gaps. Specifically, MFA is not required for email access, and annual security awareness training for all employees is not conducted.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network. This exposes the database service to potential unauthorized access and exploitation, which could lead to data breaches, data manipulation, or service disruption. This vulnerability was identified through network port scanning, which revealed the open port and the running MySQL service.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing or brute-force attacks, as a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to an employee's email, potentially leading to further internal network access or sensitive data exposure. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. This leaves employees vulnerable to evolving cyber threats, as their knowledge of best practices and new attack vectors may become outdated. A lack of regular training increases the likelihood of successful social engineering attacks, malware infections, and policy violations. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted internal IP addresses or specific application servers. For a long-term solution, consider placing the database behind a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or implementing a robust application-level authentication and authorization mechanism. Furthermore, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) should be mandated for all email access to significantly reduce the risk of account compromise. Finally, a comprehensive annual security awareness training program must be established for all employees to ensure they are continuously updated on current threats and best security practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security with MFA for critical systems and initial employee training. However, the critical exposure of the MySQL database and the absence of MFA for email access represent significant vulnerabilities that could lead to severe data breaches. The lack of annual security awareness training also poses a continuous risk. Addressing these key areas is paramount to enhancing the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and reducing its attack surface.</p>
