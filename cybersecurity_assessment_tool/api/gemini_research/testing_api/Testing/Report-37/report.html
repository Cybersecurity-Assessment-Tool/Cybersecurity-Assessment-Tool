        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes an Nginx web server (version 1.18.0) on port 443 (HTTPS). While HTTPS is used for secure communication, the Nginx version is outdated and may contain known vulnerabilities. From a policy and readiness perspective, the organization has significant gaps. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for email access or computer logins, which are critical access points. Although MFA is in place for sensitive data systems, its absence in other areas creates substantial risk. Furthermore, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees, despite providing it for new hires. These policy and training deficiencies indicate a moderate to low security readiness level, leaving the organization vulnerable to common attack vectors such as phishing, credential stuffing, and insider threats.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing, as a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to an employee's email, potentially leading to further internal network access or data exfiltration. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on email.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>User accounts</li><li>Organizational data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for employees to log into their computers. This poses a high risk, as compromised credentials (e.g., through malware or social engineering) could allow unauthorized access to workstations and the internal network. Without a second factor, the security of the entire endpoint relies solely on the password, making it a single point of failure. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on computer logins.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations</li><li>User accounts</li><li>Internal network access</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not have an employee acceptable use policy (AUP) in place. The lack of a formal AUP means there are no clear guidelines for employees regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, data, and internet access. This can lead to increased risks such as misuse of company assets, unauthorized software installations, data leakage, and a higher susceptibility to malware, as employees may unknowingly or knowingly engage in risky behaviors without clear boundaries. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for an acceptable use policy.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Data integrity and confidentiality</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This results in outdated security knowledge among staff, making them more susceptible to evolving social engineering tactics, phishing attempts, and other cyber threats. Regular training is crucial to reinforce best practices and keep employees informed about current risks, acting as a vital human firewall. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for annual security awareness training for all employees.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li><li>Susceptibility to social engineering</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Nginx Web Server Version - <span class="severity-Low">Low</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nginx web server running on port 443 is version 1.18.0. This version is older and may contain known vulnerabilities that have been patched in newer releases. Running outdated software increases the attack surface and could allow attackers to exploit known flaws to gain unauthorized access, disrupt services, or compromise the server. While no specific CVEs were identified in the provided data, maintaining current software versions is a fundamental security best practice. This was identified through the network scan data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Web server (nginx 1.18.0)</li><li>HTTPS service on port 443</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, the organization should prioritize the implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and computer logins to significantly enhance credential security. A comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) must be developed, communicated, and enforced to establish clear guidelines for IT resource usage and reduce insider threats. Furthermore, a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees should be established to ensure continuous education on evolving cyber threats and best practices. Finally, the Nginx web server should be updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities and improve overall web application security.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several significant cybersecurity risks primarily stemming from critical gaps in its security policies and practices. The absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for email and computer logins, coupled with the lack of an acceptable use policy and insufficient annual security awareness training, leaves the organization highly vulnerable to common attack vectors. While MFA is commendably used for sensitive data systems, the overall security readiness is moderate to low. Addressing these fundamental issues is crucial to establishing a robust security posture and protecting against potential breaches and data loss.</p>
