        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes a MySQL database (version 5.7.33) via port 3306, which is openly accessible. While the organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and maintains an acceptable use policy along with regular security awareness training for employees, there are significant gaps in access control. Specifically, MFA is not required for logging into computers or accessing sensitive data systems, which presents a considerable risk.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network, exposing a MySQL 5.7.33 database. This allows unauthorized access to the database if not properly secured, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service. The vulnerability was identified through network scanning.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted IP addresses or internal networks. For a more robust long-term solution, consider placing the database behind a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or implementing a secure bastion host. Furthermore, it is critical to extend Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) requirements to include computer logins and access to all sensitive data systems to significantly enhance access control and reduce the risk of unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In conclusion, the organization faces a high-severity risk due to an openly accessible MySQL database. While positive steps have been taken with email MFA and security awareness training, the absence of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems leaves critical assets vulnerable. Addressing these access control gaps and securing the exposed database port are paramount to improving the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and readiness against potential threats.</p>
