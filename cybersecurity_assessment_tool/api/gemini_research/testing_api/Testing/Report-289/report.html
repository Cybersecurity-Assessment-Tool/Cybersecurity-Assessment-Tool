        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The network scan identified a single active host with Nginx version 1.18.0 running on port 443 (HTTPS). Organizationally, the company has implemented strong multi-factor authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, and maintains an employee acceptable use policy. Annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees. However, a critical gap exists in the onboarding process, as new employees do not receive initial security awareness training.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of New Employee Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees are not receiving initial security awareness training as part of their onboarding process. This oversight creates a significant human-factor vulnerability, as new hires may be unaware of critical security policies, common threat vectors (e.g., phishing, social engineering), and best practices from their first day. This increases the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents, data breaches, or malware infections, as new employees are often targeted by adversaries due to their potential unfamiliarity with organizational procedures and systems. This vulnerability was identified through the provided organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network integrity</li><li>Overall security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>It is strongly recommended to implement mandatory security awareness training for all new employees as an integral part of their onboarding process. This training should cover essential topics such as identifying phishing attempts, strong password practices, data handling policies, acceptable use policy adherence, and incident reporting procedures. Regular, perhaps quarterly, refresher modules specifically tailored for new hires during their first year could further reinforce these critical security behaviors and knowledge.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization exhibits a commendable commitment to technical security through robust MFA implementation and established policies. However, the absence of initial security awareness training for new employees represents a significant and exploitable vulnerability. Addressing this human-factor gap is paramount to fortifying the overall security posture and ensuring that all personnel, from day one, contribute to a secure operational environment.</p>
