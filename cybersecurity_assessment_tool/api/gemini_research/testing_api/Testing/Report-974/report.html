        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exhibits several critical security weaknesses. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is utilized for email and sensitive data systems, it is notably absent for computer logins, creating a significant vulnerability. Furthermore, the organization lacks essential security awareness training for both new and existing employees, leaving them susceptible to social engineering and other human-factor risks. Network scans revealed an active FTP service (vsftpd 2.3.4) with anonymous login enabled, posing a direct threat of unauthorized data access and potential system compromise. Additionally, workstations are running an outdated Windows operating system (Windows 7), which is no longer supported and highly vulnerable to known exploits.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Operating System - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Computers are running Windows 7, which is end-of-life and no longer receives security updates. This makes them highly susceptible to known vulnerabilities and exploits, significantly increasing the risk of malware infection, data breaches, and system compromise.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Anonymous FTP Access Allowed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open FTP service (vsftpd 2.3.4) on port 21 was identified, allowing anonymous login. This enables unauthorized users to access, upload, or download files without authentication, potentially leading to data exfiltration, unauthorized file modification, or the introduction of malicious content. The vsftpd version 2.3.4 is also very old and likely contains known vulnerabilities.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>FTP Server (port 21)</li><li>Network perimeter</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or malware. A single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to a workstation and facilitate lateral movement within the network.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee workstations</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or annually for all employees. This leaves employees vulnerable to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting), malware, and poor security practices, increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents and data breaches.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately disable anonymous FTP access and update or remove the outdated vsftpd service. All workstations running Windows 7 must be upgraded to a currently supported operating system like Windows 10 or 11 to ensure they receive critical security updates. Implement mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to significantly enhance endpoint security and protect against credential theft. Furthermore, establish and enforce a comprehensive security awareness training program for all new hires and conduct annual refresher training for all employees to educate them on common cyber threats and best security practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks stemming from outdated systems, critical network misconfigurations, and gaps in foundational security policies and training. While some MFA is in place, the lack of it for computer logins and the absence of regular security awareness training create substantial vulnerabilities. Addressing these issues, particularly the anonymous FTP access and outdated operating systems, is paramount to improving the organization's overall security posture and readiness against potential cyber threats.</p>
