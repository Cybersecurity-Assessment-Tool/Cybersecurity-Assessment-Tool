        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The network scan identified an Nginx web server (version 1.18.0) operating on port 443 (HTTPS), indicating an active web presence. However, a review of the organization's security practices reveals several critical deficiencies in its readiness posture. Key areas of concern include the absence of multi-factor authentication for computer logins and sensitive data systems, a lack of a formal employee acceptable use policy, and insufficient recurring security awareness training for all employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for employees to log into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if a user's password is compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or other credential theft methods. Without a second factor, a single compromised credential can grant an attacker full access to an endpoint. This vulnerability was identified through the organization's self-reported security practices.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk, as these systems typically house confidential or proprietary information. A compromised single-factor credential could lead to a severe data breach, regulatory non-compliance, financial losses, and significant reputational damage. This vulnerability was identified through the organization's self-reported security practices.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All sensitive data systems</li><li>Associated user accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy (AUP). Without a clear AUP, employees may be unaware of the proper and secure use of company assets, networks, and data. This absence can lead to inadvertent security breaches, installation of unauthorized software, misuse of company resources, and increased susceptibility to social engineering attacks, as there are no defined guidelines for secure behavior. This vulnerability was identified through the organization's self-reported security practices.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational network</li><li>Data</li><li>Systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Recurring Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual or regular security awareness training for all employees. This creates a gap where employees may forget initial training, remain unaware of evolving cyber threats (e.g., new phishing techniques, ransomware variants), or fail to reinforce best practices. This increases the organization's susceptibility to human-factor risks, such as social engineering and malware infections. This vulnerability was identified through the organization's self-reported security practices.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational network</li><li>Data</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance its security posture, the organization must prioritize the implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and, most critically, for access to all sensitive data systems. This will provide a robust defense against credential compromise. Concurrently, it is essential to develop and enforce a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) that clearly defines expectations for the secure and appropriate use of company resources and data. Furthermore, establishing a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees is crucial to ensure continuous education on evolving cyber threats and to reinforce secure behaviors, thereby reducing human-centric risks.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces a high level of cybersecurity risk due to significant vulnerabilities in its access control mechanisms and employee awareness programs. The absence of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, coupled with the lack of an AUP and insufficient recurring security training, creates substantial exposure to unauthorized access, data breaches, and operational disruptions. Addressing these fundamental security gaps is imperative to improve overall readiness and protect critical organizational assets effectively.</p>
