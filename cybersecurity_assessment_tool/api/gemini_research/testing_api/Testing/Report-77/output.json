            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network scan revealed an open RDP port (3389), which presents a significant remote access exposure. Furthermore, the organization currently lacks Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for critical access points including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. Positively, the organization has an acceptable use policy in place and conducts regular security awareness training for all employees.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "RDP Exposure",
                        "Overview": "Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed directly to the internet via an open port (3389). This allows potential attackers to attempt brute-force attacks or exploit RDP vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to internal systems. The impact could range from unauthorized data access to full system compromise. This was identified through a network scan.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "IP"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "It is strongly recommended to immediately close port 3389 to external access to mitigate the RDP exposure. For legitimate remote access needs, implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to ensure all connections are encrypted and properly authenticated. Furthermore, to address the lack of robust authentication, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) should be implemented across all critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. This will significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials. Regular security awareness training should continue, emphasizing the importance of strong passwords and reporting suspicious activities.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces a critical security risk due to an exposed RDP port, which could lead to unauthorized system access. The absence of Multi-Factor Authentication across key systems further exacerbates the risk of credential-based attacks. While the organization demonstrates good practices in employee acceptable use policies and security awareness training, these foundational security controls are undermined by significant technical vulnerabilities. Addressing the RDP exposure and implementing MFA are paramount to improving the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and reducing its attack surface."
