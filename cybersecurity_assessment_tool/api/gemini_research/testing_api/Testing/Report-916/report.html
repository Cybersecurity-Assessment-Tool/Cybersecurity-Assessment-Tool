        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to cybersecurity through its implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, an established employee acceptable use policy, and consistent security awareness training for all employees. However, a significant gap exists in the enforcement of MFA for access to sensitive data systems. The provided network scan data was minimal, indicating a host is up with all scanned ports closed, which limits the scope of technical network vulnerability assessment.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if primary credentials are compromised (e.g., via phishing, keylogging, or brute-force attacks). Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to sensitive data, leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and severe reputational damage. This vulnerability was identified through the review of organizational security policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified high-severity risk, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems. This will add a crucial layer of security, significantly reducing the likelihood of unauthorized access even if primary credentials are compromised. Furthermore, it is advisable to conduct regular, comprehensive vulnerability assessments and penetration tests across all network assets and applications to identify and remediate any technical vulnerabilities not covered by the limited network scan data. Ensure all systems and software are kept up-to-date with the latest security patches. Regularly review and update security policies to adapt to evolving threat landscapes and ensure continuous compliance.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has established a commendable baseline for security awareness and general access control through MFA for email and computer logins, the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems represents a critical vulnerability. This gap could expose the organization to significant data breach risks. Addressing this specific control deficiency is paramount to enhancing the overall security posture and readiness against sophisticated cyber threats. Continuous monitoring, regular assessments, and policy enforcement will be key to maintaining a robust security environment.</p>
