        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, and having an acceptable use policy and initial security awareness training for new employees. However, critical gaps exist, including the lack of MFA for sensitive data systems and the absence of annual security awareness training for all employees. Network scans also revealed an exposed SSH service and a critical 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability, indicating potential external attack surfaces and internal configuration issues.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A critical vulnerability identified as 'Localhost Exposed' was found. This indicates a severe configuration issue or misconfiguration that could potentially allow unauthorized access or information disclosure from the internal network. The specific impact depends on what services are exposed and accessible via localhost, but given its critical severity, it represents a significant risk to the integrity and confidentiality of the system. This was identified through internal vulnerability assessment data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Access Control for Sensitive Data - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are compromised, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for entry. A successful credential theft could lead to a data breach involving sensitive information. This was identified from the organizational security policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Employee Security Awareness - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual training for all employees. This can lead to a degradation of security knowledge over time, making employees more susceptible to social engineering attacks, phishing, and other human-factor vulnerabilities. This increases the likelihood of successful attacks that exploit human error. This was identified from the organizational security policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed SSH Service - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A network scan identified an open SSH (port 22) service on a host. While SSH is a secure protocol, an open port presents an attack surface for brute-force attempts, credential stuffing, or exploitation of unpatched SSH vulnerabilities. Without further context on its necessity or access restrictions, it represents a potential entry point for attackers to gain unauthorized access to the system. This was identified from the network scan data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with open port 22</li><li>Network perimeter</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access. Furthermore, a comprehensive annual security awareness training program should be established for all employees to maintain and update their knowledge on current threats and best practices. The exposed SSH service on port 22 should be reviewed; if not essential, it should be closed, or access should be strictly limited to authorized IP addresses and secured with strong authentication methods. The 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability requires immediate investigation and remediation, given its critical severity. Regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing should be conducted to proactively identify and address security weaknesses.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several significant security risks, particularly concerning access control for sensitive data, ongoing employee security awareness, and exposed network services. While some security measures are in place, the absence of MFA for sensitive data and annual training, coupled with critical network vulnerabilities, indicates a moderate to high readiness gap. Addressing these issues promptly is crucial to enhance the overall security posture and protect against potential breaches.</p>
