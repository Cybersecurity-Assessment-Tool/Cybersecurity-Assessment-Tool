        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization currently implements Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, and conducts annual security awareness training for all employees. An acceptable use policy is also in place. However, a critical gap exists in MFA implementation for sensitive data systems, and new employees do not receive initial security awareness training. A recent network scan identified an open port 8080 with a 'TOP SECRET DB' title, but this has been confirmed as a false positive or secured, indicating no immediate network-level vulnerability from this specific finding.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Multi-Factor Authentication for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or other means. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to sensitive data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Onboarding Security Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. This leaves new hires vulnerable to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) and unaware of critical security policies and best practices from the start. A lack of initial training can lead to inadvertent security breaches and a weak security culture.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li><li>Potential for social engineering attacks</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems. This will significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access even if user credentials are compromised. Additionally, a comprehensive security awareness training program should be established for all new employees during their onboarding process to ensure they are immediately aware of security policies, best practices, and common threats like phishing. Regular reinforcement of security principles through ongoing training is also crucial.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has foundational security measures such as MFA for email and computer logins, and annual security awareness training, significant vulnerabilities remain. The absence of MFA for sensitive data systems and the lack of initial security awareness training for new employees represent critical gaps that could be exploited by attackers. Addressing these areas is paramount to improving the overall security readiness and protecting sensitive organizational assets.</p>
