            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network assessment reveals several critical security deficiencies. An Nmap scan identified an open FTP service allowing anonymous access, posing a significant data exposure risk. Furthermore, the organization's policies indicate a widespread lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, drastically increasing the attack surface for credential-based attacks. The absence of an employee acceptable use policy also introduces governance and behavioral risks. Additionally, the presence of outdated Windows 7 workstations, which are no longer supported, presents a severe vulnerability to known exploits. While security awareness training is conducted, these fundamental technical and policy gaps undermine overall security posture.",

                        "Overview": "Several workstations are running Windows 7, which has reached its end-of-life and no longer receives security updates from Microsoft. This leaves these systems highly vulnerable to known exploits and malware, posing a significant risk to the entire network.",

                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "1. Disable Anonymous FTP Access: Immediately configure the vsftpd server to disallow anonymous logins. If FTP is necessary, implement secure alternatives like SFTP or FTPS with strong authentication. 2. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Mandate MFA for all critical access points, including email, computer logins, and especially sensitive data systems. This is a crucial step to prevent unauthorized access even if passwords are compromised. 3. Develop and Enforce an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP): Create a comprehensive AUP that clearly outlines employee responsibilities and acceptable behavior regarding IT resource usage. Ensure all employees are trained on and acknowledge this policy. 4. Upgrade Outdated Operating Systems: Prioritize upgrading all Windows 7 workstations to a currently supported operating system (e.g., Windows 10 or 11). If immediate upgrades are not feasible, isolate these systems from the main network and implement compensating controls. 5. Regular Vulnerability Scanning and Patch Management: Establish a routine for scanning for vulnerabilities and promptly applying security patches to all systems and applications.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces a significant number of high-severity security risks, primarily stemming from critical technical vulnerabilities like anonymous FTP access and the widespread absence of Multi-Factor Authentication across key systems. The presence of end-of-life operating systems further exacerbates the risk profile. While security awareness training is a positive step, the lack of fundamental security controls and policies, such as an acceptable use policy, indicates a low overall security readiness. Addressing these identified vulnerabilities through immediate technical remediation and policy implementation is paramount to significantly improve the organization's cybersecurity posture and reduce the likelihood of a successful cyberattack."
