        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network assessment reveals several critical security deficiencies. An Nmap scan identified an open FTP service allowing anonymous access, posing a significant data exposure risk. Furthermore, the organization's policies indicate a widespread lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, drastically increasing the attack surface for credential-based attacks. The absence of an employee acceptable use policy also introduces governance and behavioral risks. Additionally, the presence of outdated Windows 7 workstations, which are no longer supported, presents a severe vulnerability to known exploits. While security awareness training is conducted, these fundamental technical and policy gaps undermine overall security posture.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Anonymous FTP Access - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The FTP server (vsftpd 2.3.4) on port 21 allows anonymous login. This can lead to unauthorized access to files, data exfiltration, or even server compromise if write permissions are misconfigured. It was identified via Nmap scan.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>FTP Server (vsftpd 2.3.4)</li><li>Port 21</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No MFA for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing or brute-force attacks, as a single compromised password could grant full access to an employee's email.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email System</li><li>User Accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if passwords are stolen or guessed, potentially leading to lateral movement within the network.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations</li><li>User Accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk to data confidentiality and integrity, as a compromised single factor could grant access to highly sensitive information.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive Data Systems</li><li>User Accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This means there are no formal guidelines for employees regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, increasing the risk of misuse, security incidents, and legal liabilities.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employees</li><li>IT Resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Windows Policy - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Several workstations are running Windows 7, which has reached its end-of-life and no longer receives security updates from Microsoft. This leaves these systems highly vulnerable to known exploits and malware, posing a significant risk to the entire network.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations running Windows 7</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>1. Disable Anonymous FTP Access: Immediately configure the vsftpd server to disallow anonymous logins. If FTP is necessary, implement secure alternatives like SFTP or FTPS with strong authentication. 2. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Mandate MFA for all critical access points, including email, computer logins, and especially sensitive data systems. This is a crucial step to prevent unauthorized access even if passwords are compromised. 3. Develop and Enforce an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP): Create a comprehensive AUP that clearly outlines employee responsibilities and acceptable behavior regarding IT resource usage. Ensure all employees are trained on and acknowledge this policy. 4. Upgrade Outdated Operating Systems: Prioritize upgrading all Windows 7 workstations to a currently supported operating system (e.g., Windows 10 or 11). If immediate upgrades are not feasible, isolate these systems from the main network and implement compensating controls. 5. Regular Vulnerability Scanning and Patch Management: Establish a routine for scanning for vulnerabilities and promptly applying security patches to all systems and applications.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces a significant number of high-severity security risks, primarily stemming from critical technical vulnerabilities like anonymous FTP access and the widespread absence of Multi-Factor Authentication across key systems. The presence of end-of-life operating systems further exacerbates the risk profile. While security awareness training is a positive step, the lack of fundamental security controls and policies, such as an acceptable use policy, indicates a low overall security readiness. Addressing these identified vulnerabilities through immediate technical remediation and policy implementation is paramount to significantly improve the organization's cybersecurity posture and reduce the likelihood of a successful cyberattack.</p>
