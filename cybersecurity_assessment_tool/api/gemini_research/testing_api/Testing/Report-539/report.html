        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network infrastructure was assessed, revealing an open SSH port (22) on a scanned host. From an organizational policy standpoint, the company demonstrates a commitment to security by requiring Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems, and conducting annual security awareness training for all employees, alongside having an acceptable use policy. However, a significant gap exists as MFA is not required for computer logins, and new employees do not receive initial security awareness training.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A critical vulnerability has been identified where the localhost is exposed, potentially allowing unauthorized access to internal systems. This was identified through network scanning revealing an exposed localhost service. The impact could be severe, leading to full system compromise, data exfiltration, or denial of service.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH (port 22) service was detected on a host within the network during the Nmap scan. While SSH is a legitimate service for remote administration, an open port presents an attack surface. If not properly secured with strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., key-based authentication, MFA) and kept up-to-date with the latest security patches, it could be exploited for unauthorized access, brute-force attacks, or serve as an entry point for further network penetration.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 22</li><li>Host with open port 22</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately investigate and remediate the 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability, as its critical severity poses an imminent threat. This may involve reconfiguring network access controls, patching systems, or disabling unnecessary services. For the 'Open SSH Port', ensure that SSH configurations adhere to best practices, including disabling root login, using strong, complex passwords or preferably key-based authentication, implementing rate limiting, and keeping the SSH server software updated. Furthermore, to enhance the organization's overall security posture, implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised. It is also crucial to introduce mandatory security awareness training for all new employees during their onboarding process to ensure a foundational understanding of cybersecurity best practices from day one.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces critical security risks, primarily due to an exposed localhost service and an open SSH port, which could lead to significant compromise if exploited. While the organization has commendable practices such as MFA for sensitive systems and annual security training, the absence of MFA for computer logins and initial security training for new employees represents notable gaps in its defense-in-depth strategy. Addressing these vulnerabilities and policy shortcomings is paramount to improving the overall cybersecurity readiness and resilience against potential threats.</p>
