            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network currently exposes Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) directly to the internet, presenting a critical vulnerability. Internally, while MFA is used for email and computer logins, it is notably absent for sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization lacks a comprehensive security awareness training program for both new and existing employees, indicating a significant gap in human-factor security controls. An acceptable use policy is in place.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "RDP Exposure",
                        "Overview": "Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed directly to the internet via port 3389. This allows potential attackers to attempt brute-force attacks or exploit vulnerabilities in the RDP service to gain unauthorized access to internal systems. This was identified by an Nmap scan showing port 3389 open.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "External IP Address (Port 3389)"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if credentials are compromised, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication. This was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Sensitive data systems"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Insufficient Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees nor does it provide annual refresher training for all employees. This leaves employees vulnerable to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, malware) and increases the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents. This was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "Organizational security posture"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "Immediately close port 3389 to the internet to mitigate the critical RDP exposure. Implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) for secure remote access to internal resources, ensuring all RDP connections are routed through the VPN. Furthermore, it is crucial to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to add an additional layer of security beyond passwords. Finally, establish a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees and conduct annual refresher training for all staff to educate them on common threats and best practices, thereby strengthening the human firewall.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization faces critical and high-severity risks primarily due to direct RDP exposure and the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems. The lack of comprehensive security awareness training further exacerbates the overall risk posture. While some foundational security measures like MFA for email and computer logins, and an acceptable use policy are in place, significant vulnerabilities remain that require immediate attention to enhance the organization's cybersecurity readiness."
