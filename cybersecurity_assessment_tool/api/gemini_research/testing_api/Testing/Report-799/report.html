        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan data indicates an active host with an open SSH service on port 22. Organizational data reveals several critical gaps in security posture, including the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems, a lack of an employee acceptable use policy, and insufficient annual security awareness training for all employees. While new employees receive initial training and MFA is required for computer logins, these specific deficiencies significantly elevate the overall risk profile.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts through phishing, brute-force attacks, or stolen credentials. Compromised email accounts can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and serve as a pivot point for further network penetration.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li><li>Sensitive communications</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are compromised. Attackers gaining access to these systems could exfiltrate, alter, or destroy sensitive information, leading to severe financial, reputational, and regulatory consequences.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>Critical applications</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without a clear AUP, employees may unknowingly engage in activities that pose security risks, such as using company resources for unauthorized purposes, installing unapproved software, or visiting malicious websites. This increases the attack surface and makes it harder to enforce security best practices and maintain a consistent security culture.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee workstations</li><li>Network resources</li><li>Organizational data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. While new employees receive initial training, the lack of recurring training means employees may not be updated on the latest threats, best practices, or company policies. This increases susceptibility to social engineering attacks, phishing, and other human-factor vulnerabilities.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network security</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed SSH Service - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An Nmap scan identified an open SSH (port 22) service. While SSH is a legitimate service for secure remote access, an exposed SSH port without robust security controls (such as strong password policies, key-based authentication, IP whitelisting, and MFA) can be a target for brute-force attacks or credential stuffing. Given the general lack of MFA in other critical areas, the risk associated with this open port is elevated if not properly managed.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Network perimeter</li><li>Servers exposing SSH</li><li>Remote access infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and sensitive data systems immediately. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy that clearly outlines expected behavior and prohibited activities when using company resources. Establish a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees to ensure they are continuously updated on current threats and best practices. For the exposed SSH service, implement strict access controls including strong, unique SSH keys, IP whitelisting, and consider disabling password authentication in favor of key-based authentication. Regularly review and audit SSH configurations and access logs to detect and prevent unauthorized access attempts.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to the absence of MFA in critical areas like email and sensitive data systems, coupled with gaps in foundational security practices such as an acceptable use policy and recurring security awareness training. The presence of an open SSH port further exacerbates these risks if not adequately secured. While MFA for computer logins and initial new employee training are positive steps, the identified vulnerabilities indicate a low overall readiness against sophisticated cyber threats. Addressing these issues proactively is crucial to enhance the organization's security posture and protect its assets.</p>
