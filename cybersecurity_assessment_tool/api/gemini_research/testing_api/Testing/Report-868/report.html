        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The network scan data provided is minimal, indicating no open ports or services were explicitly identified, or the scan was not comprehensive enough to detail active services. However, an assessment of the organization's security policies reveals significant gaps in foundational security controls. Specifically, the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across critical access points and the lack of regular, annual security awareness training for all employees present substantial risks to the organization's overall security posture.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for email access. This significantly increases the risk of email account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. A compromised email account can lead to Business Email Compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and serve as a pivot point for further attacks within the network.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee email accounts</li><li>Email servers</li><li>Organizational communication</li><li>User credentials</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MFA is not required for logging into computers. This leaves employee workstations and potentially network resources vulnerable to unauthorized access if a user's password is stolen or guessed. Attackers can gain initial access, perform lateral movement, and escalate privileges more easily without this critical layer of defense.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network access points</li><li>User accounts</li><li>Internal network resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Access to sensitive data systems does not require MFA. This is a critical vulnerability, as a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to confidential information, intellectual property, or customer data. The impact of such a breach could include severe financial losses, regulatory penalties, and significant reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Databases containing sensitive data</li><li>CRM/ERP systems</li><li>HR systems</li><li>Financial applications</li><li>Confidential organizational data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual training for all employees. This means employees may not be updated on the latest threats, forget best practices, or become complacent over time. A lack of ongoing training increases the organization's susceptibility to social engineering attacks, phishing, and other human-factor vulnerabilities.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security culture</li><li>Susceptibility to social engineering and phishing attacks</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, immediate implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is strongly recommended across all critical access points, including email systems, computer logins, and especially sensitive data systems. This will provide a crucial additional layer of security beyond passwords. Furthermore, it is imperative to establish a program for annual security awareness training for all employees. This training should be comprehensive, cover current threat landscapes, and reinforce best practices to mitigate human-factor risks. Regular training ensures that employees remain vigilant and informed about evolving cybersecurity threats.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to the widespread absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and a lack of ongoing security awareness training. While an acceptable use policy is in place and new employees receive initial training, these measures are insufficient to protect against modern threats. The current readiness level is low, making the organization highly vulnerable to credential theft, unauthorized access, and data breaches. Addressing these fundamental security gaps is critical to improving the overall security posture and protecting organizational assets.</p>
