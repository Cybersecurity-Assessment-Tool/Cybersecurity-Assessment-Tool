            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems, and maintaining an acceptable use policy. However, significant vulnerabilities were identified, including an open HTTP port, a lack of MFA for computer logins, and a complete absence of security awareness training for both new and existing employees. These gaps expose the organization to various risks, from unencrypted data transmission to social engineering attacks and unauthorized system access.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Unsecured HTTP Service",
                        "Overview": "An open port 80 (HTTP) was detected during the network scan. This indicates a web server or service running without encryption. Data transmitted over HTTP is vulnerable to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks, potentially exposing sensitive information if not properly secured or if an unencrypted web application is hosted. This was identified via Nmap scan data.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Port 80",

                        "Risk": "Weak Authentication for Computer Access",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access. If employee credentials are stolen or compromised through phishing, malware, or brute-force attacks, attackers could gain access to internal systems with just a single factor (password). This was identified from the organizational data.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                    {
                        "Risk": "Untrained New Employees",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. This leaves new hires vulnerable to common social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) and unaware of critical organizational security policies and best practices. This lack of initial training can lead to accidental data breaches, malware infections, or other security incidents. This was identified from the organizational data.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                    {
                        "Risk": "Outdated Security Knowledge",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. Without regular training, employees' knowledge of evolving cyber threats, new attack vectors, and updated security policies can become outdated. This increases the likelihood of successful social engineering attacks, malware propagation, and non-compliance with security protocols over time. This was identified from the organizational data.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "Organizational data",
                            "Network infrastructure"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to enhance access security. The open port 80 should be immediately secured; if a web service is necessary, it must be configured to use HTTPS with a valid SSL/TLS certificate to encrypt all traffic. Furthermore, a comprehensive security awareness training program should be established, including mandatory training for all new employees during onboarding and annual refresher training for all existing staff to ensure up-to-date knowledge of cyber threats and best practices.",
            "Conclusion": "While the organization has some essential security controls in place, critical vulnerabilities in authentication, network hygiene, and employee training significantly impact its overall security posture. Addressing the lack of MFA for computer access, securing unencrypted network services, and implementing robust, ongoing security awareness training are paramount steps to enhance readiness against modern cyber threats and protect organizational assets."
