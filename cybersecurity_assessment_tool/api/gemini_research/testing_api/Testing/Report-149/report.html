        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) port (3389) directly exposed to the internet. This critical vulnerability is compounded by significant gaps in the organization's security posture, as indicated by the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization does not have an employee acceptable use policy and fails to conduct security awareness training for new employees or annually for all staff. These deficiencies collectively point to a low security maturity level and a high susceptibility to cyber threats.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>RDP Exposure - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed directly to the internet via an open port (3389), as identified by an Nmap scan. This allows external attackers to attempt to brute-force RDP credentials or exploit known vulnerabilities in the RDP service to gain unauthorized access to internal systems. Unauthorized access via RDP can lead to data breaches, system compromise, and ransomware attacks, posing a critical threat to the organization's data integrity and operational continuity.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Public-facing IP address with port 3389 open</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediate action is required to mitigate the critical RDP exposure. The most straightforward fix is to close port 3389 to external access. For long-term secure remote access, implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution, requiring users to connect to the VPN before accessing RDP. Beyond this, the organization must address its foundational security weaknesses. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised. Develop and enforce an employee acceptable use policy to define expected security behaviors. Crucially, establish a comprehensive security awareness training program for all new employees and conduct annual refresher training for all staff to educate them on common threats like phishing, social engineering, and secure computing practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces a critical security risk due to an exposed RDP service, which provides a direct entry point for attackers. This is compounded by a significant lack of basic security controls, including the absence of MFA for critical systems and a complete lack of security awareness training and acceptable use policies. The organization's current security posture indicates a low level of readiness against common cyber threats, making it highly vulnerable to various attack vectors. Urgent implementation of the recommended mitigations and foundational security practices is essential to improve its cybersecurity posture.</p>
