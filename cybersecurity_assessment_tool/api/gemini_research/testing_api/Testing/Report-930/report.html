        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan indicates at least one host is active, with port 80 currently closed. The organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and computer logins. However, MFA is not required for accessing sensitive data systems. An employee acceptable use policy is in place, but there is a notable absence of security awareness training for both new and existing employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unencrypted Web Server - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Port 80 was identified as potentially open, indicating a risk of an unencrypted web server. This allows for unencrypted communication, making any data transmitted over this port vulnerable to interception and eavesdropping. The impact is a compromise of data confidentiality. This risk was identified through a security assessment.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>It is recommended to implement strong encryption protocols, such as SSL/TLS, for all web services to protect data in transit. If port 80 is not intentionally used, it should be closed. Furthermore, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) should be extended to all sensitive data systems to enhance access control. The organization should also establish and regularly conduct security awareness training for all employees, including new hires, to educate them on best security practices and common threats.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has some foundational security controls like MFA for email and computer logins, and an acceptable use policy, significant vulnerabilities remain. The potential for an unencrypted web server and the lack of MFA for sensitive data systems pose considerable risks to data confidentiality and integrity. The absence of regular security awareness training further exacerbates these risks by leaving employees susceptible to social engineering and other human-factor exploits. Addressing these areas is crucial for improving the overall security posture and readiness.</p>
