        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and computer logins, and by having an employee acceptable use policy. New employees also receive security awareness training. However, critical gaps exist in the protection of sensitive data systems, which currently do not enforce MFA, and in the ongoing security education of all employees, as annual security awareness training is not conducted.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Access Control for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if primary credentials are compromised (e.g., via phishing, brute-force, or credential stuffing attacks). An attacker gaining access to a user's password could directly access sensitive data without an additional layer of security, leading to potential data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and reputational damage. This vulnerability was identified through the organization's self-reported security practices.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Ongoing Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This leads to a degradation of security knowledge over time, making employees more susceptible to evolving social engineering attacks (e.g., advanced phishing, vishing, malware delivery). A lack of regular refreshers can result in employees forgetting best practices, increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents, such as clicking malicious links, downloading infected files, or falling victim to impersonation scams. This vulnerability was identified through the organization's self-reported security practices.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure (via employee actions)</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to establish a critical layer of defense against unauthorized access. Furthermore, a comprehensive program for mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees should be established and enforced. This training should cover current threat landscapes, social engineering tactics, and best practices for data handling and incident reporting, ensuring that the human element remains a strong defense rather than a vulnerability.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization has established a baseline of security controls, including MFA for email and computer logins, and initial security awareness training for new hires. However, the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems and the lack of ongoing annual security awareness training for all employees represent significant vulnerabilities. Addressing these critical gaps is essential to enhance the organization's overall security posture, protect sensitive information, and reduce the likelihood of successful cyberattacks.</p>
