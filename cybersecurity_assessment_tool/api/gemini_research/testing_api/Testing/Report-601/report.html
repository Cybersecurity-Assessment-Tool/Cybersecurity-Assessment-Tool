        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The network assessment identified a single host with port 443 open, running Nginx version 1.18.0, indicating a web server is operational. From an organizational standpoint, the company has implemented strong multi-factor authentication (MFA) across email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, and conducts regular security awareness training for all employees. However, a critical policy gap exists as the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Web Server Software - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Nginx version 1.18.0 is an older release. Running outdated software can expose the organization to known vulnerabilities that have been patched in newer versions. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access, disrupt services, or compromise data. This risk was identified through the Nmap scan which reported the specific Nginx version.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Nginx 1.18.0 web server</li><li>Port 443</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy (AUP). Without clear guidelines, employees may unknowingly or knowingly engage in behaviors that introduce security risks, such as misuse of company IT resources, improper handling of sensitive data, or accessing malicious content. This significantly increases the risk of data breaches, malware infections, and potential legal liabilities. This gap was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately upgrades its Nginx web server to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities and establishes a regular patching schedule for all software. Concurrently, a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy should be developed, implemented, and communicated to all employees, ensuring they receive training and acknowledge their understanding. Regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing should also be conducted to proactively identify and address any new weaknesses in the network infrastructure and applications.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a commendable commitment to security in several key areas, particularly with its widespread MFA implementation and consistent security awareness training. However, the presence of an outdated web server and, more critically, the absence of a formal employee acceptable use policy represent significant vulnerabilities that could be exploited. Addressing these identified gaps is paramount to enhancing the overall security posture, reducing the risk of cyber incidents, and ensuring a more robust defense against potential threats.</p>
