        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network, as per the Nmap scan, shows all hosts are up with no open ports detected, suggesting a minimal external attack surface from a port-scanning perspective. Internally, the organization has a foundational security posture with an acceptable use policy and regular security awareness training for all employees. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for sensitive data systems, which is a positive step. However, critical gaps exist in MFA implementation for email and computer logins, which significantly elevates the risk profile.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Multi-Factor Authentication for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This leaves email accounts highly vulnerable to various attacks, including phishing, credential stuffing, and brute-force attacks. A compromised email account can serve as a primary entry point for attackers to launch Business Email Compromise (BEC) scams, exfiltrate sensitive information, or gain initial access for further network penetration. This vulnerability was identified through organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on email access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee email accounts</li><li>Email servers</li><li>Cloud email services</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Multi-Factor Authentication for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to workstations and servers if user credentials are stolen, guessed, or compromised through other means. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker direct access to internal systems, enabling lateral movement, data exfiltration, and potential system compromise. This vulnerability was identified through organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on computer logins.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Domain controllers</li><li>Network servers</li><li>Remote access systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points. Specifically, MFA should be mandated for all employee email accounts to protect against phishing and credential theft. Additionally, MFA must be enforced for all computer logins, including workstations and servers, to prevent unauthorized access even if primary credentials are compromised. Regular audits of MFA implementation and user training on its importance should also be conducted. While the Nmap scan showed no open ports, continuous monitoring and vulnerability scanning of internal systems are advised to identify any emerging network-level weaknesses.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to cybersecurity through its acceptable use policy and security awareness training. However, the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for email and computer logins represents critical vulnerabilities that expose the organization to a high risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. Addressing these MFA gaps is paramount to improving overall readiness and resilience against modern cyber threats.</p>
