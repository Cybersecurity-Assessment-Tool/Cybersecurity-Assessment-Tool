        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Based on the provided organizational data, the network's specific technical details are unavailable due to broken scan data. However, an assessment of the organization's security policies reveals significant foundational weaknesses, particularly in identity and access management and employee security awareness. The absence of critical security controls indicates a heightened risk exposure across the organization's digital assets.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to email accounts through phishing, brute-force attacks, or compromised credentials. Email often contains sensitive information and can be a gateway to other systems. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This leaves computer systems vulnerable to unauthorized access if passwords are stolen, guessed, or brute-forced. Compromised workstations can lead to lateral movement within the network and data exfiltration. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All organizational computers</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without an AUP, employees may not be fully aware of their responsibilities regarding the use of company IT resources, leading to potential misuse, data breaches, or non-compliance with security best practices. This policy gap can result in inconsistent security behavior across the organization. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational IT resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Recurring Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This means that existing employees may not be updated on the latest threats, best practices, or evolving company policies, leading to a degradation of security posture over time. Human error remains a significant factor in security incidents. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, immediate action should be taken to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email and computer login systems. This will drastically reduce the risk of credential-based attacks. Concurrently, a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy (AUP) must be developed, communicated, and enforced to establish clear guidelines for the responsible use of IT resources. Furthermore, a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees should be established to ensure continuous education on current threats, best practices, and policy updates, fostering a stronger security culture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant vulnerabilities primarily due to the absence of critical foundational security controls, specifically the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for email and computer access, and the absence of an acceptable use policy. While initial security training for new employees is a positive step, the lack of recurring annual training for all staff leaves the organization susceptible to evolving threats and human-factor risks. Addressing these identified gaps is paramount to improving overall cybersecurity readiness and mitigating the likelihood of successful cyberattacks.</p>
