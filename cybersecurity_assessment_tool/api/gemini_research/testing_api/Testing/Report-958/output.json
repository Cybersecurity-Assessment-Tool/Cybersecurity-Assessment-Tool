            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization demonstrates a strong foundational security posture with multi-factor authentication (MFA) implemented for email access, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. An employee acceptable use policy is in place, and new employees receive security awareness training. However, a significant gap exists in the absence of annual security awareness training for all employees. No network-level vulnerabilities were identified through the provided network scan data.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of Annual Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. This oversight can lead to a decrease in employee vigilance against evolving cyber threats such as phishing, social engineering, and malware. Without regular refreshers, employees may forget best practices, increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents. This was identified through the organizational data provided.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All Employees",

                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "It is strongly recommended that the organization implement mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees. This training should cover current threat landscapes, phishing recognition, social engineering tactics, data handling best practices, and incident reporting procedures. Regular training ensures that employees remain vigilant and informed, significantly reducing the risk of human-factor security breaches. Additionally, consider periodic simulated phishing campaigns to test employee readiness and reinforce training concepts.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization has established a commendable baseline for security, particularly with its widespread adoption of MFA and initial employee training. However, the absence of recurring annual security awareness training for all staff presents a notable vulnerability. Addressing this gap is crucial for maintaining a robust defense against evolving cyber threats and ensuring a consistently high level of security readiness across the entire workforce."
