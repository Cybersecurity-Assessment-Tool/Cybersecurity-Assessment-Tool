        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and access to sensitive data systems, and by having an employee acceptable use policy and security awareness training for new employees. However, critical gaps exist, particularly regarding email security and ongoing employee education. The provided network scan data and current vulnerabilities list were broken and could not be processed for technical findings.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. Email accounts are frequently targeted by phishing, spoofing, and credential stuffing attacks. Without MFA, a compromised username and password pair can grant an attacker full access to an employee's inbox, potentially leading to sensitive data exposure, business email compromise (BEC) scams, or further lateral movement within the network. This vulnerability was identified through the organization's self-reported data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>All user email accounts</li><li>Organizational communication</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This leaves existing staff potentially unaware of evolving cyber threats, new organizational policies, or best practices for data handling and incident reporting. A lack of continuous education increases the risk of human error, making employees more susceptible to social engineering attacks, malware infections, and accidental data breaches. This vulnerability was identified through the organization's self-reported data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li><li>Security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts without delay. This critical step will significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access to email systems. Additionally, establish and enforce a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees. This training should cover current threat landscapes, phishing recognition, secure data handling, and incident reporting procedures to ensure continuous education and vigilance across the workforce.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization has established a baseline for security with MFA for computer logins and sensitive data, along with an acceptable use policy and initial security training. However, the absence of MFA for email and a lack of recurring annual security awareness training for all employees represent significant vulnerabilities that could be exploited. Addressing these gaps is crucial for improving the overall resilience against common cyber threats and fostering a more robust security culture.</p>
