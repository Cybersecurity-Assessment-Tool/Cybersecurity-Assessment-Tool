        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open HTTPS port (443) running Nginx version 1.18.0. While a web server is operational, the Nginx version is outdated, potentially exposing the system to known vulnerabilities. Organizational data indicates several critical gaps in security posture, including a lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or provide annual training for all employees, significantly increasing the risk of human-factor related breaches. An acceptable use policy is in place, and MFA is required for computer logins, which are positive aspects, but these do not fully mitigate the other identified risks.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access through credential stuffing, phishing, or brute-force attacks. A compromised email account can serve as a gateway for further network penetration, data exfiltration, and business email compromise (BEC) scams. This vulnerability was identified from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Access to systems containing sensitive data does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are compromised. The impact could include data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, financial penalties, and severe reputational damage. This vulnerability was identified from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not provide security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) due to their unfamiliarity with organizational security policies and common threat vectors. This lack of initial training increases the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents. This vulnerability was identified from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Annual Security Awareness Training for All Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. Without regular training, employees may become complacent, forget best practices, or remain unaware of evolving cyber threats and attack techniques. This significantly elevates the risk of successful social engineering attacks, malware infections, and insider threats. This vulnerability was identified from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Nginx Version - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nginx web server detected on port 443 is running version 1.18.0. This version is outdated and may contain known vulnerabilities that have been addressed in newer releases. Running outdated software increases the attack surface, making the server susceptible to exploits that could lead to denial of service, unauthorized access, or data compromise. This vulnerability was identified during the network scan.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Web server (nginx 1.18.0) on port 443</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and sensitive data systems immediately. This is a critical step to prevent unauthorized access even if primary credentials are stolen. Furthermore, a comprehensive security awareness training program should be established, including mandatory training for all new employees upon onboarding and annual refresher training for all staff. This will significantly improve the human firewall against social engineering attacks. Finally, the Nginx web server should be updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities and ensure optimal security and performance. Regular patch management for all software and systems is crucial.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to a lack of robust authentication mechanisms for critical systems and an absence of a consistent security awareness training program. While some foundational elements like an acceptable use policy and MFA for computer logins are present, the vulnerabilities related to email, sensitive data access, and employee training leave the organization highly susceptible to various cyber threats. Addressing these areas is paramount to improving the overall security posture and readiness against potential attacks.</p>
