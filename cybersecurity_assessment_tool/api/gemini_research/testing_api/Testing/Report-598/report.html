        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Based on the provided organizational data, the organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, and has an acceptable use policy and initial security awareness training for new employees. However, there are gaps in MFA coverage for sensitive data systems and in recurring security awareness training for all employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if primary credentials are compromised. An attacker gaining access to a user's password could directly access sensitive data without an additional layer of authentication, leading to data breaches, compliance violations, and reputational damage. This was identified through the organizational data indicating "Do you require MFA to access sensitive data systems?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Recurring Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. While new employees receive initial training, the lack of regular, ongoing training means employees may not be kept up-to-date on evolving threats, best practices, and organizational policies. This can lead to increased susceptibility to phishing attacks, social engineering, and other human-factor vulnerabilities, potentially resulting in security incidents. This was identified through the organizational data indicating "Does your organization do security awareness training for all employees at least once per year?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li><li>Data integrity</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, the organization should prioritize implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to establish an additional layer of security against credential compromise. Furthermore, a comprehensive and mandatory annual security awareness training program should be established for all employees. This training should cover current threat landscapes, phishing recognition, data handling best practices, and incident reporting procedures to ensure a continuously informed and vigilant workforce.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security with MFA for email and computer logins, and initial security awareness training. However, critical vulnerabilities exist due to the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems and the lack of recurring security awareness training for all employees. Addressing these gaps is crucial for enhancing the overall security posture and reducing the risk of data breaches and other security incidents.</p>
