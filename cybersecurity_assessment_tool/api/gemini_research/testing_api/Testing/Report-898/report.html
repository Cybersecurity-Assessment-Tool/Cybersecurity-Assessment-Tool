        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, and conducting annual security awareness training for all employees. However, significant gaps exist in critical areas such as MFA for sensitive data systems, the presence of an employee acceptable use policy, and security awareness training for new hires. These omissions expose the organization to elevated risks of unauthorized data access, insider threats, and social engineering attacks.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information should primary credentials be compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or other means. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to sensitive data, leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and reputational damage. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive Data Systems</li><li>User Accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. The absence of such a policy means there are no clear guidelines for employees regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, internet, email, and data. This can lead to misuse of company assets, increased exposure to malware, data leakage, and potential legal liabilities. Without defined boundaries, employees may inadvertently or intentionally engage in activities that compromise security. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All Employees</li><li>Company IT Resources</li><li>Data Handling Procedures</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not provide security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering attacks, as they may be less familiar with company policies, procedures, and common threat vectors. A lack of initial training leaves new employees vulnerable to phishing, malware, and other cyber threats, potentially making them an unwitting entry point for attackers into the organization's network. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New Employees</li><li>Organizational Security Posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access. Concurrently, develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy that clearly outlines expectations for IT resource usage and data handling. Furthermore, establish a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees, ensuring they are educated on current cyber threats and organizational security protocols from day one. Regular reinforcement of security best practices through ongoing training is also crucial.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has implemented some essential security measures like MFA for email and computer logins, and annual security training, critical vulnerabilities remain. The absence of MFA for sensitive data, a formal acceptable use policy, and initial security training for new employees significantly elevates the organization's risk profile. Addressing these gaps is paramount to enhancing the overall security posture and protecting against potential data breaches and operational disruptions.</p>
