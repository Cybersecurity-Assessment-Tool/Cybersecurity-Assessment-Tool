        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Based on the provided organizational data, the organization currently lacks fundamental security controls such as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across critical access points including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, there is an absence of security awareness training for both new hires and existing employees on an annual basis. While an acceptable use policy is in place, the lack of these foundational security practices significantly elevates the organization's overall risk posture. No technical network vulnerabilities were identified from the provided scan data.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee inboxes if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. Email often serves as a primary vector for further attacks and contains sensitive information.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if user credentials are stolen or guessed. Compromised computers can lead to lateral movement within the network, data exfiltration, and installation of malware.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk to the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to critical data, potentially leading to data breaches, regulatory fines, and reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>Cloud storage</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. This means new hires may not be aware of common cyber threats (e.g., phishing, social engineering), organizational security policies, or best practices for protecting sensitive information. This lack of initial training increases the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. Regular training is crucial to keep employees updated on evolving threats, reinforce security best practices, and maintain a strong security culture. Without it, employees' awareness can degrade over time, making them more susceptible to sophisticated attacks.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, including email systems, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. This foundational control will drastically reduce the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials. Concurrently, the organization must establish and enforce a comprehensive security awareness training program. This program should include mandatory training for all new employees upon onboarding and annual refresher training for all existing staff. Training should cover topics such as identifying phishing attempts, safe browsing habits, password hygiene, and the importance of reporting suspicious activities. Regular training will cultivate a security-conscious culture and empower employees to act as a strong line of defense against cyber threats.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently exhibits significant vulnerabilities primarily stemming from a lack of fundamental security controls and an underdeveloped security awareness program. The absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, coupled with no regular or initial security awareness training, places the organization at a high risk of credential compromise, unauthorized access, and successful social engineering attacks. While an acceptable use policy is in place, the overall readiness against modern cyber threats is low. Addressing these critical gaps through the immediate implementation of MFA and a robust security awareness training program is paramount to improving the organization's resilience and protecting its assets.</p>
