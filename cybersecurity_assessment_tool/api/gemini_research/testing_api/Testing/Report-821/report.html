        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan identified an open Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) port (3389) exposed to the internet, presenting a critical vulnerability. While the organization demonstrates good security practices by requiring Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, and conducting regular security awareness training with an acceptable use policy, a significant gap exists as MFA is not required for accessing sensitive data systems. This indicates a mixed security posture, with strong foundational elements but critical exposure points and inconsistencies in access control for high-value assets.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>RDP Exposure - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed to the internet via an open port (3389). This allows potential attackers to attempt brute-force attacks or exploit RDP vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to internal systems. The presence of an open RDP port was identified during the network scan, indicating a direct attack vector from the public internet.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3389 on target IP address</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information should an attacker compromise a single set of credentials. Without MFA, a stolen password is sufficient to gain entry, bypassing an essential layer of security.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems access controls</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>It is strongly recommended to immediately close the exposed RDP port (3389) to the internet to eliminate the critical attack surface. For necessary remote access, implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution to secure connections, ensuring all RDP traffic is tunneled through an authenticated and encrypted channel. Furthermore, multi-factor authentication (MFA) should be extended to all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access, aligning with the organization's existing MFA practices for email and computer logins and strengthening overall access control.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces a critical vulnerability due to an exposed RDP port, which presents an immediate and severe risk of unauthorized system access. While the organization has commendable security awareness training and MFA for general access, the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems creates a significant internal security gap. Addressing these critical exposures and inconsistencies in access control is paramount to improving the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and protecting its valuable assets.</p>
