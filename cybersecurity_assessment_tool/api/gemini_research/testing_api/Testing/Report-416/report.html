        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Based on the provided data, the organization has an open port 80, indicating a web server or service is exposed. While security awareness training is conducted, there are significant gaps in multi-factor authentication (MFA) implementation and the absence of an employee acceptable use policy. Specifically, MFA is not required for logging into computers or accessing sensitive data systems, which are critical security weaknesses.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for employees to log into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or malware. Without a second factor, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's workstation and potentially the internal network. This was identified from the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Internal network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not enforced for accessing sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk, as unauthorized access to these systems could lead to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, financial loss, and reputational damage. Attackers who gain access to credentials for these systems would have direct access to critical information without an additional layer of security. This was identified from the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>Confidential information</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy (AUP). An AUP defines the proper and acceptable ways employees can use company resources, including computers, networks, and data. Without such a policy, there is an increased risk of employees engaging in insecure practices, misusing company assets, or inadvertently introducing security threats due to a lack of clear guidelines. This can lead to legal liabilities, data breaches, and system compromises. This was identified from the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Data integrity</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open Port 80 (HTTP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A network scan revealed an open port 80 (HTTP). While HTTP is a standard protocol for web traffic, an open port 80 without proper security configurations (e.g., redirection to HTTPS, strong web server hardening, up-to-date software) can expose the organization to various web-based attacks, including unencrypted data transmission, web server vulnerabilities (e.g., outdated software, misconfigurations), and potential entry points for attackers. The specific service running on port 80 was not identified, but any service on this port should be thoroughly secured. This was identified from the network scan data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Web server</li><li>Network perimeter</li><li>Data transmitted over HTTP</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, immediate action should be taken to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and, critically, for access to sensitive data systems. This will provide a robust defense against credential theft. Furthermore, a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy must be developed, communicated, and enforced to establish clear guidelines for secure behavior and resource utilization. The open port 80 should be thoroughly investigated; if a web service is running, it must be secured with HTTPS, kept up-to-date, and hardened against common web vulnerabilities. If the port is not intentionally open, it should be closed. Regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing are also recommended to proactively identify and address emerging threats.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently exhibits a mixed security readiness profile. While it demonstrates a commitment to security awareness training, significant vulnerabilities exist due to the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for critical access points (computer logins and sensitive data systems) and the absence of an employee acceptable use policy. The presence of an open port 80 also warrants immediate attention. These weaknesses collectively expose the organization to a high risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and operational disruption. Addressing these fundamental security gaps is paramount to achieving a more resilient and secure environment.</p>
