        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network assessment revealed an active host with an open SSH service on port 22. While MFA is utilized for email access, it is notably absent for computer logins and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees, though new hires do receive initial training. These findings indicate a mixed security posture with critical gaps in access control and policy enforcement.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This vulnerability indicates a critical misconfiguration where internal services or data, potentially including the SSH service identified on port 22, are exposed externally or are accessible in a way that bypasses intended security controls. The impact is severe, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or full system compromise. It was identified through a security assessment indicating a critical exposure.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and access to sensitive data systems. A comprehensive employee acceptable use policy should be developed and enforced to establish clear guidelines for technology usage. Furthermore, regular, at least annual, security awareness training for all employees is crucial to maintain a strong security culture. The 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability requires immediate attention, including a thorough review of network configurations, service bindings, and firewall rules to ensure that no critical services are inadvertently exposed, especially the SSH service on port 22. Implement least privilege principles for all network services.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces critical vulnerabilities, primarily stemming from a 'Localhost Exposed' condition with a high severity, alongside significant gaps in access control policies and employee training. While some security measures are in place, the absence of MFA for critical systems, lack of an acceptable use policy, and infrequent security awareness training indicate a low readiness level against sophisticated cyber threats. Addressing these issues promptly is essential to enhance the overall security posture and protect organizational assets.</p>
