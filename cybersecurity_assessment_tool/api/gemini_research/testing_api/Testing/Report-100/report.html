        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The network scan indicates that no open ports were identified on the target hosts, suggesting a potentially well-secured external perimeter or internal network configuration. All scanned hosts were found to be operational. The organization has implemented multi-factor authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, and has an employee acceptable use policy in place. However, a key area for improvement identified is the lack of annual security awareness training for all employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. This oversight significantly increases the risk of successful social engineering attacks, phishing campaigns, and other human-factor vulnerabilities. Employees who are not regularly updated on current threats and best practices are more likely to fall victim to scams, inadvertently compromise credentials, or mishandle sensitive data. While MFA is in place, human error can still lead to breaches through sophisticated social engineering. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li><li>Data integrity and confidentiality</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>It is strongly recommended that the organization implement a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees. This training should cover current threat landscapes, phishing identification, social engineering tactics, data handling best practices, and the importance of strong password hygiene and MFA. Regular training will significantly reduce the human element risk and strengthen the overall security posture. Additionally, consider conducting simulated phishing exercises periodically to test employee readiness and reinforce training concepts.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization demonstrates a strong foundation with MFA implementation across critical systems and an acceptable use policy, the absence of annual security awareness training for all employees presents a notable vulnerability. The network scan did not reveal any immediate technical vulnerabilities, but the human factor remains a significant attack vector. Addressing the training gap is crucial for enhancing the organization's readiness against evolving cyber threats and maintaining a robust security posture.</p>
