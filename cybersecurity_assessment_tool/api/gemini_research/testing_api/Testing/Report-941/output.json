            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network currently exposes an open Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) port (3389), which is a critical vulnerability. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is utilized for email and sensitive data systems, it is notably absent for computer logins, creating a significant authentication weakness. Furthermore, the organization lacks fundamental security controls, including an employee acceptable use policy and any form of security awareness training for both new and existing employees. These deficiencies indicate a low level of security readiness and a high susceptibility to both external and internal threats.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "RDP Exposure",
                        "Overview": "Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed to the internet via an open port (3389). This allows potential attackers to attempt to brute-force credentials or exploit vulnerabilities in the RDP service to gain unauthorized access to internal systems. The impact could range from data theft to full system compromise. This vulnerability was identified through a network scan.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "IP address with open port 3389"

                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Computer Login",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or guessed, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication. The impact could be widespread internal system compromise, lateral movement, and data exfiltration. This was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employee computers",

                    {
                        "Risk": "No Employee Acceptable Use Policy",
                        "Overview": "The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines, employees may engage in activities that inadvertently introduce security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive data. This increases the risk of malware infections, data breaches, and compliance violations. This was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",

                    {
                        "Risk": "No Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or annually for all employees. This leaves employees vulnerable to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) and unaware of best practices for protecting organizational assets. Human error is a leading cause of security incidents, and the lack of training significantly elevates this risk, potentially leading to data breaches, malware infections, and financial losses. This was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "Organizational data and systems"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "Immediate action should be taken to mitigate the critical RDP exposure by closing port 3389. For long-term secure remote access, implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) for all RDP connections. It is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to significantly enhance credential security and prevent unauthorized access. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to clearly define acceptable behavior and reduce insider threats. Crucially, establish a mandatory security awareness training program for all new hires and conduct annual refresher training for all employees to educate them on current threats, social engineering tactics, and best security practices.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks, primarily due to an exposed RDP service and several critical gaps in its security policies and employee training. The lack of MFA for computer logins, an acceptable use policy, and regular security awareness training creates a vulnerable environment susceptible to various attack vectors, including external exploitation and internal human error. Addressing these vulnerabilities is paramount to improving the organization's overall security posture and readiness against cyber threats."
