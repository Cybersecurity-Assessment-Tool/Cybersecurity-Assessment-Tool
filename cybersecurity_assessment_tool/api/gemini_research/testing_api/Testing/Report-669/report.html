        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open port 8080 hosting a service titled 'TOP SECRET DB', indicating a critical exposure of potentially sensitive data. While the organization implements MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, it lacks MFA for email access. Furthermore, there is a significant gap in security awareness training, as neither new employees nor all employees annually receive such training, increasing the risk of human-factor vulnerabilities. An acceptable use policy is in place.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed Sensitive Database - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open port 8080 was identified, hosting a service explicitly titled 'TOP SECRET DB'. This direct exposure of a potentially critical database or sensitive system to the network without apparent robust access controls or authentication mechanisms presents an extreme risk. Unauthorized access could lead to severe data breaches, data manipulation, or complete system compromise, impacting confidentiality, integrity, and availability.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li><li>Service 'TOP SECRET DB'</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly elevates the risk of email account compromise through common attack vectors such as phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. A compromised email account can serve as a gateway for further internal attacks, data exfiltration, business email compromise (BEC) scams, or impersonation, leading to financial loss and reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>User email accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees are not provided with security awareness training upon joining the organization. This leaves them highly vulnerable to social engineering attacks, phishing attempts, and other common cyber threats, as they may lack the necessary knowledge to identify and respond to malicious activities. This oversight increases the likelihood of human error leading to initial security breaches or incidents.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Annual Security Awareness Training for All Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. Without regular, updated training, employees' knowledge of cybersecurity best practices and evolving threats can become outdated or forgotten. This degradation of the 'human firewall' over time increases the organization's susceptibility to various cyberattacks that exploit human vulnerabilities, such as phishing, malware, and social engineering.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediate action is required to address the critically exposed 'TOP SECRET DB' on port 8080; this service should be secured, moved behind a firewall, or taken offline until proper security measures are implemented. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access to significantly reduce the risk of account compromise. Establish and enforce mandatory security awareness training for all new employees as part of their onboarding process. Furthermore, institute annual security awareness training for all employees to ensure continuous education on evolving threats and best practices, reinforcing the human element of defense.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization faces critical security risks, primarily due to an exposed sensitive database and significant gaps in human-factor security, specifically the lack of MFA for email and comprehensive security awareness training. While some foundational security practices like MFA for sensitive systems and an acceptable use policy are in place, these are overshadowed by the identified critical and high-severity vulnerabilities. The current readiness is low, and immediate, targeted interventions are essential to prevent potential data breaches and enhance the overall security posture.</p>
