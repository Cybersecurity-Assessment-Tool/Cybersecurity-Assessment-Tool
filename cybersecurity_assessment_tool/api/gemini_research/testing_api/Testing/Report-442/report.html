        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network posture, based on the provided data, indicates a foundational understanding of some security practices, such as requiring MFA for computer logins and having an acceptable use policy. However, critical gaps exist in protecting key access points and maintaining a consistently informed workforce. Specifically, the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for email and sensitive data systems, coupled with a lack of annual security awareness training for all employees, presents significant vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unprotected Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Email accounts are a primary target for phishing and credential stuffing attacks. Without Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), compromised credentials can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive communications, data, and potentially other linked systems. This significantly increases the risk of data breaches and business email compromise (BEC) attacks. This was identified through the organization's self-reported data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unprotected Sensitive Data Access - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Critical systems containing sensitive organizational data are vulnerable if not protected by MFA. A single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to confidential information, intellectual property, or customer data, leading to severe financial, reputational, and regulatory consequences. This was identified through the organization's self-reported data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Stale Security Awareness - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive training, the absence of annual security awareness training for all employees means that knowledge can become outdated, and new threats may not be adequately communicated. This increases the likelihood of employees falling victim to evolving social engineering tactics, phishing, and other human-centric attacks, thereby weakening the organization's overall security posture. This was identified through the organization's self-reported data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and sensitive data systems immediately. This will significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised. Furthermore, a comprehensive annual security awareness training program should be established for all employees, not just new hires. This training should cover current threat landscapes, phishing recognition, data handling best practices, and the importance of strong password hygiene, ensuring that the entire workforce remains vigilant and informed against evolving cyber threats. Regular policy reviews and updates are also advised to ensure alignment with current security standards.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently exhibits a mixed state of cybersecurity readiness. While some essential controls are in place, the lack of MFA for email and sensitive data systems, alongside insufficient recurring security awareness training, represents critical vulnerabilities. Addressing these areas is paramount to enhancing the organization's defense against common cyber threats, protecting sensitive information, and fostering a more robust security culture. Proactive implementation of the recommended measures will significantly improve the overall security posture and reduce the likelihood of successful cyberattacks.</p>
