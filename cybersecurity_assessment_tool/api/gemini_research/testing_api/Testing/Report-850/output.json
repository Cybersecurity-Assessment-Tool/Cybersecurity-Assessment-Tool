            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems, and by conducting regular security awareness training for all employees, including new hires. However, a critical gap exists in workstation authentication, as MFA is not mandated for computer logins. Additionally, the absence of a formal employee acceptable use policy leaves the organization vulnerable to human error and inconsistent security practices.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Inadequate Authentication for Workstations",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for employees to log into their computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to internal systems and data if an employee's credentials are compromised (e.g., via phishing or malware). Without MFA, a single stolen password can grant an attacker full access to a workstation, potentially leading to lateral movement within the network, data exfiltration, or system disruption. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'Do you require MFA to log into computers?':'No'.",
                        "Severity": "High",

                            "All employee workstations",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of Employee Acceptable Use Policy",
                        "Overview": "The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. This means there are no clear guidelines for employees regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, data handling, internet usage, and security best practices. Without such a policy, employees may unknowingly engage in risky behaviors, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive information, leading to increased exposure to malware, data breaches, and compliance violations. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'Does your organization have an employee acceptable use policy?':'No'.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "Company IT resources",
                            "Sensitive data",
                            "Organizational reputation",
                            "Compliance posture"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins across the enterprise. This will significantly enhance the security posture by adding an essential layer of protection against credential theft. Furthermore, the organization should develop and formally implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy. This policy should clearly outline expectations for the secure and appropriate use of company IT assets, data handling, and internet access, and be communicated to all employees. Regular review and enforcement of this policy will help standardize security practices and reduce human-related risks.",
            "Conclusion": "While the organization has established some good security practices, such as MFA for sensitive systems and regular security awareness training, critical vulnerabilities remain. The absence of MFA for computer logins presents a high risk of unauthorized access, and the lack of an acceptable use policy creates an environment where inconsistent security behaviors can thrive. Addressing these two key areas will significantly improve the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and reduce its attack surface."
