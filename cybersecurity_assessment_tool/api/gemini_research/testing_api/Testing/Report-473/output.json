            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network scan revealed an open Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) port (3389), indicating a direct exposure to potential external threats. Furthermore, the organization currently does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access or computer logins, significantly increasing the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are compromised. While MFA is used for sensitive data systems, and an acceptable use policy is in place with security awareness training for new employees, there is a critical gap in annual security awareness training for all employees.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "RDP Exposure",
                        "Overview": "An open Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) port (3389) was identified during the network scan. This exposure allows direct access to internal systems from the internet, making them vulnerable to brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, and exploitation of RDP vulnerabilities. A successful compromise could lead to unauthorized access, data exfiltration, and lateral movement within the network. The risk was identified via an Nmap scan showing port 3389 as open.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "System with open RDP port (3389)"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email and Computer Login",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email or logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks. If an attacker obtains a user's password, they can gain full access to their email and potentially their workstation without an additional layer of security. This vulnerability was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Email systems",
                            "Employee workstations",
                            "User accounts"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Insufficient Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This gap means that employees may not be regularly updated on the latest threats, best practices, and organizational policies, increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents such as phishing attacks, malware infections, or data breaches. This vulnerability was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "Organizational data and systems"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately close the exposed RDP port (3389) to the internet. For necessary remote access, implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution to secure connections. Furthermore, implement and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and computer logins to significantly enhance credential security. Finally, establish a comprehensive annual security awareness training program for all employees to ensure continuous education on current threats and best practices.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces critical security vulnerabilities, primarily due to an exposed RDP port and a lack of MFA for key access points like email and computer logins. While some security measures are in place, such as MFA for sensitive data and initial employee training, the absence of comprehensive annual security awareness training further exacerbates the overall risk posture. Addressing these critical and high-severity findings is paramount to improving the organization's cybersecurity readiness and protecting against potential breaches."
