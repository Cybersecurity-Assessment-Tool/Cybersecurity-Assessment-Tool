        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's current security posture indicates several critical gaps, primarily concerning multi-factor authentication (MFA) and foundational security policies. While MFA is implemented for sensitive data systems, it is notably absent for email access and computer logins, leaving significant attack vectors open. Furthermore, the lack of an employee acceptable use policy and security awareness training for new employees introduces considerable human-factor risks, despite annual training for all existing employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee inboxes through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks. Compromised email accounts can lead to further internal system breaches, data exfiltration, and business email compromise (BEC) scams. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on email access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee email accounts</li><li>Email server infrastructure</li><li>User credentials</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for employees to log into their computers. This exposes endpoints to unauthorized access if primary credentials are stolen or guessed. A compromised computer can serve as an entry point for lateral movement within the network, installation of malware, and access to internal resources. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on computer logins.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee workstations and laptops</li><li>Domain controllers</li><li>Network access points</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). Without an AUP, employees may not be fully aware of their responsibilities regarding the use of company IT resources, data handling, and internet usage. This can lead to increased risks such as data leakage, introduction of malware, non-compliance with regulations, and general misuse of company assets. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for an acceptable use policy.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Sensitive data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees upon onboarding. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering attacks due to their unfamiliarity with company policies, procedures, and common threats. This gap increases the likelihood of successful phishing, malware infections, and other human-factor exploits during a critical period of employment. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for security awareness training for new employees.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Company network</li><li>Internal systems</li><li>Sensitive information</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, immediate implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and computer logins is strongly recommended. This critical step will drastically reduce the risk of credential-based attacks. Concurrently, develop and enforce a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) to clearly define expected behavior and responsibilities for IT resource usage. Furthermore, establish mandatory security awareness training for all new employees as part of their onboarding process, complementing the existing annual training for all staff. Regular review and updates of these policies and training programs should also be conducted to adapt to evolving threat landscapes.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to the absence of MFA in critical access points (email and computer logins) and foundational gaps in security policies and new employee training. While annual security awareness training is a positive step, the identified vulnerabilities create substantial exposure to unauthorized access, data breaches, and operational disruptions. Addressing these areas with urgency is paramount to improving overall security readiness and protecting organizational assets.</p>
