        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open SSH port (22) on a host, indicating a potential entry point if not adequately secured. Furthermore, a critical vulnerability related to localhost exposure was identified. While the organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems, it notably lacks MFA for computer logins, which poses a significant risk. On the positive side, the organization conducts security awareness training for both new and existing employees annually, demonstrating a commitment to human-centric security. However, the absence of an employee acceptable use policy leaves a gap in defining appropriate conduct for IT resource usage.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A critical vulnerability was identified where localhost is exposed, potentially allowing unauthorized access or information disclosure. The exact nature of the exposure requires further investigation, but its presence indicates a severe misconfiguration or an active threat vector. This was identified through a vulnerability assessment.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port (22) - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH port (22) was detected on a host within the network during the Nmap scan. While SSH is a legitimate service for remote administration, an open port represents a potential attack surface. If not properly secured with strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., key-based authentication, disabled password authentication), restricted access via firewall rules, and regular patching, it could be exploited for unauthorized access, leading to system compromise or data exfiltration.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 22</li><li>Network hosts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly weakens the authentication process, making systems vulnerable to credential stuffing, phishing, or brute-force attacks. If an attacker obtains a user's password, they can gain unauthorized access to the computer without an additional verification step. This policy gap was identified through organizational data review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Servers</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines on the appropriate use of company IT resources, internet access, and data handling, employees may inadvertently engage in risky behaviors, such as visiting malicious websites, downloading unauthorized software, or mishandling sensitive information. This increases the likelihood of malware infections, data breaches, and potential legal or compliance issues. This policy gap was identified through organizational data review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT infrastructure</li><li>Data assets</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, several key actions are recommended. Firstly, for the critical "Localhost Exposed" vulnerability, an immediate investigation is required to understand the scope and nature of the exposure, followed by implementing strict access controls or disabling the unnecessary service. For the "Open SSH Port (22)", it is crucial to harden SSH configurations by enforcing key-based authentication, disabling password authentication, restricting access to trusted IP addresses via firewall rules, and ensuring the SSH server is regularly patched. Secondly, to address the "Lack of MFA for Computer Logins", the organization should prioritize implementing Multi-Factor Authentication for all computer logins across the enterprise to significantly enhance authentication security. Lastly, to rectify the "Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy", a comprehensive policy should be developed, clearly outlining acceptable and unacceptable use of company IT resources, and all employees must be trained on its contents and acknowledge their understanding. Regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing should also be conducted to proactively identify and address new threats.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a mixed security posture. Strengths include the implementation of MFA for email and sensitive data systems, alongside regular security awareness training for all employees. However, significant vulnerabilities exist, including a critical localhost exposure, an open SSH port, and the absence of MFA for computer logins, which collectively present considerable attack vectors. The lack of an acceptable use policy further introduces potential human-factor risks. Addressing these identified weaknesses through the recommended actions is crucial for enhancing the overall security readiness and protecting organizational assets from potential cyber threats.</p>
