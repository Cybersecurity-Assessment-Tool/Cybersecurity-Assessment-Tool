        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization currently lacks multi-factor authentication (MFA) across critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are compromised. While the organization has an acceptable use policy and conducts regular security awareness training for employees, the absence of MFA is a major security gap. Network scans indicate an open SSH port (22), which, if not properly secured, could be an entry point for attackers.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The system's localhost interface is exposed, potentially allowing unauthorized access or information disclosure from internal network segments or misconfigured services. This was identified through network scanning showing an open port 22 (SSH) on the host, indicating a service listening on an interface that might be accessible beyond its intended scope. The impact could range from unauthorized access to sensitive data to full system compromise.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Localhost IP</li><li>Port 22 (SSH)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for accessing email, logging into computers, or accessing sensitive data systems. This leaves accounts vulnerable to credential stuffing, phishing, and brute-force attacks, as a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access. The absence of MFA significantly elevates the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email access</li><li>Computer login</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, immediate action is required. Firstly, implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. This is a fundamental control to prevent unauthorized access even if passwords are stolen. Secondly, address the "Localhost Exposed" vulnerability by ensuring that services listening on localhost are not inadvertently exposed to external networks or are properly firewalled and secured. Specifically, review the configuration of SSH (port 22) to restrict access to trusted IPs only, use strong authentication methods (e.g., key-based authentication), and disable password authentication. Regularly audit network configurations and open ports to prevent unintended exposures.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant security risks primarily due to the complete absence of multi-factor authentication across critical systems and the presence of an exposed localhost service with an open SSH port. While positive steps have been taken with an acceptable use policy and security awareness training, these are insufficient to mitigate the high risks posed by easily exploitable access vectors. Without immediate implementation of MFA and proper network segmentation and service hardening, the organization remains highly vulnerable to unauthorized access and potential data breaches.</p>
