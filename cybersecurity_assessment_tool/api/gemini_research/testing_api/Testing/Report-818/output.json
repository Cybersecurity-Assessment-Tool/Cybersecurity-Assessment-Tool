            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to access control by implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. However, a network scan revealed an open FTP service (vsftpd 2.3.4) on port 21 that permits anonymous access, posing a critical data exposure risk. Furthermore, the organization lacks essential security policies and training, specifically an employee acceptable use policy and regular security awareness training for both new and existing employees. Several workstations are also identified as running Windows 7, an outdated operating system no longer receiving security updates, which introduces significant vulnerability to the endpoint environment.",

                        "Risk": "Anonymous FTP Access",
                        "Overview": "A network scan identified an open FTP service (vsftpd 2.3.4) on port 21 that allows anonymous login. This configuration enables unauthorized users to potentially access, upload, or download files without any authentication, leading to risks such as data breaches, data manipulation, or the introduction of malicious content onto the server. This vulnerability was identified via an Nmap scan utilizing the 'ftp-anon' script.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of Employee Acceptable Use Policy",
                        "Overview": "The organization currently lacks an employee acceptable use policy (AUP). Without a clear AUP, employees may not fully understand their responsibilities regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, data handling procedures, and internet usage. This absence increases the risk of misuse of company assets, inadvertent data leaks, and non-compliance with security best practices, as there are no formal guidelines to govern employee conduct related to IT systems.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Insufficient Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees, nor does it provide annual training for all existing employees. This significant gap leaves the entire workforce vulnerable to various human-factor cyber threats, including social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting), malware, and insider threats. Employees who are not regularly educated on current cyber risks are less likely to identify and appropriately respond to malicious attempts, making them potential entry points for attackers.",

                        "Risk": "Outdated Operating System (Windows 7)",
                        "Overview": "Several workstations within the organization are running Windows 7, an operating system that has reached its end-of-life and no longer receives security updates or patches from Microsoft. This exposes these systems to known and newly discovered vulnerabilities, making them easy targets for exploitation by attackers. The lack of ongoing security support significantly increases the risk of malware infection, data compromise, and potential network intrusion through these vulnerable endpoints.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Workstations"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "Immediate action is required to mitigate the critical risk of anonymous FTP access by disabling this feature and securing the FTP server, or decommissioning it if not essential for business operations. The organization must prioritize the development and implementation of a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy, ensuring all employees are thoroughly educated on its contents and adhere to its guidelines. Concurrently, a robust security awareness training program should be established, including mandatory training for all new hires and annual refreshers for the entire staff, to enhance the workforce's ability to identify and respond to cyber threats. All workstations currently running Windows 7 must be upgraded to a currently supported operating system, such as Windows 10 or 11, to ensure they receive critical security patches and updates. For long-term planning, consider a phased hardware refresh cycle to support modern operating systems and security features.",
            "Conclusion": "While the organization has made commendable progress in implementing multi-factor authentication for critical access points, its overall cybersecurity readiness is significantly compromised by several fundamental vulnerabilities. The presence of anonymous FTP access, the complete absence of essential security policies like an acceptable use policy, and a critical lack of security awareness training expose the organization to substantial human-factor risks and potential data breaches. The continued use of end-of-life operating systems further compounds these risks, creating easily exploitable entry points. Addressing these core deficiencies is paramount to establishing a secure, compliant, and resilient cybersecurity posture capable of defending against modern threats."
