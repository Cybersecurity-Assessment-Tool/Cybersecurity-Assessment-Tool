            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network scan revealed an open Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) port (3389), which is a significant exposure point. Furthermore, the organization currently does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for critical access points such as email, computer logins, or sensitive data systems. While the organization has an acceptable use policy and conducts regular security awareness training for all employees, the lack of MFA and exposed RDP port represent considerable security gaps.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "RDP Exposure",
                        "Overview": "The Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) port (3389) was found to be openly accessible from the internet. This exposes the system to potential brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, and exploitation of RDP vulnerabilities, which could lead to unauthorized access and system compromise. This was identified via network port scanning.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "IP"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email, logging into computers, or accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if employee credentials are compromised through phishing, malware, or other means, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication. This was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Email access",
                            "Computer logins",
                            "Sensitive data systems"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "It is strongly recommended to immediately close the publicly accessible RDP port (3389) to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access. For remote access, implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution with strong authentication. Furthermore, the organization should prioritize the implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, to significantly enhance credential security and prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised.",
            "Conclusion": "The assessment reveals critical vulnerabilities primarily due to an exposed RDP port and the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across key systems. While the organization demonstrates good practices in security awareness training and policy enforcement, these technical gaps significantly lower its overall security readiness. Addressing the RDP exposure and implementing MFA are paramount steps to improve the organization's defensive posture against common cyber threats."
