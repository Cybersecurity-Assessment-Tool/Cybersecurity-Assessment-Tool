        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's current security posture indicates significant gaps in foundational security controls, particularly concerning multi-factor authentication (MFA) and employee security awareness. While MFA is used for email access, it is notably absent for computer logins and sensitive data systems, leaving critical assets vulnerable to credential-based attacks. Furthermore, the complete lack of an employee acceptable use policy and any form of security awareness training (for new hires or annually for all employees) suggests a high risk of human-factor vulnerabilities, including social engineering and accidental data breaches. The absence of network scan data and specific vulnerability findings from the provided input limits a comprehensive technical assessment, but the organizational data alone points to a low state of readiness against common cyber threats.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Employees can log into company computers without multi-factor authentication. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to endpoints and the internal network if employee credentials are stolen, phished, or otherwise compromised. A single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to a workstation.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network access points</li><li>Internal network resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Access to systems containing sensitive organizational data does not require multi-factor authentication. This poses a critical risk, as a compromised single factor (e.g., a password) could allow unauthorized individuals to access, exfiltrate, or tamper with sensitive information, leading to severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>File shares with sensitive data</li><li>Cloud storage for sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an established acceptable use policy for its employees. Without clear guidelines, employees may be unaware of their responsibilities regarding the use of company IT resources, internet access, email, and data handling. This can lead to misuse of company assets, increased risk of malware infections, data leakage, and potential legal or compliance issues due to unapproved activities.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT infrastructure</li><li>Data handling processes</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training upon joining the organization. This leaves them unprepared to identify and respond to common cyber threats such as phishing, social engineering, and malware. New hires are often targeted by attackers and, without proper training, are more likely to fall victim to such attacks, potentially compromising the organization's security from their first day.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Email systems</li><li>Internal network</li><li>Company data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Annual Security Awareness Training for All Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. Without regular refreshers, employees' knowledge of evolving cyber threats and best security practices can become outdated, leading to complacency and an increased susceptibility to new attack vectors. This creates an ongoing human vulnerability across the entire workforce.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Email systems</li><li>Internal network</li><li>Company data</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, immediate action is required in several key areas. Firstly, implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and access to sensitive data systems. This critical step will drastically reduce the risk of unauthorized access even if passwords are compromised. Secondly, develop and formally implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy, ensuring all employees are aware of their responsibilities when using company IT resources. Concurrently, establish a robust security awareness training program that includes mandatory training for all new employees upon onboarding and annual refresher training for all existing employees. These trainings should cover topics such as phishing, social engineering, password hygiene, and data handling best practices. Addressing these fundamental gaps will build a stronger human firewall and reduce the overall attack surface.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces a high level of risk due to critical deficiencies in its security controls, particularly concerning multi-factor authentication for key access points and a complete absence of employee security awareness programs and policies. While MFA is present for email, its lack for computer logins and sensitive data systems, combined with no acceptable use policy or security training, creates significant vulnerabilities that could be exploited through credential theft or social engineering. The organization's current readiness against common cyber threats is low, necessitating urgent implementation of the recommended security measures to protect its assets and data.</p>
