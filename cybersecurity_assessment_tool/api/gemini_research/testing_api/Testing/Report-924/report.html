        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Based on the available organizational data, this report assesses the current cybersecurity posture. The organization demonstrates a commitment to security awareness training for all employees, including new hires, and requires Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive data systems. However, critical gaps exist in identity and access management for email and computer logins, and there is a notable absence of a formal employee acceptable use policy. Due to broken network scan data and current vulnerabilities data, this assessment is primarily based on the provided organizational policy information.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks. A compromised email account can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, or further lateral movement within the network, impacting data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on email access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>User accounts</li><li>Organizational data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for employees to log into their computers. This leaves workstations vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials (username and password) are compromised. An attacker gaining access to a computer can potentially access internal resources, install malware, or escalate privileges, posing a significant threat to the entire network infrastructure. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on computer login.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations</li><li>User accounts</li><li>Network access</li><li>Internal systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines, employees may engage in activities that inadvertently or intentionally introduce security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive data. This absence can lead to inconsistent security practices, increased exposure to malware, and potential legal or compliance issues due to undefined boundaries for technology usage. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for an acceptable use policy.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Organizational culture</li><li>Employee behavior</li><li>Data handling practices</li><li>System usage</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and computer logins across the organization. This will significantly enhance identity and access management, making it much harder for unauthorized users to gain access even if primary credentials are stolen. Furthermore, the organization should develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy. This policy should clearly define expectations for technology usage, data handling, and secure computing practices, and be communicated to all employees. Regular reviews and updates to this policy, alongside continued security awareness training, will foster a stronger security culture and reduce human-factor risks.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security through regular security awareness training and MFA for sensitive data systems. However, critical vulnerabilities exist due to the lack of MFA for email and computer logins, and the absence of an acceptable use policy. Addressing these high-severity risks by implementing robust MFA across all access points and establishing clear policy guidelines is paramount to improving the overall security posture and readiness against modern cyber threats. Without these fundamental controls, the organization remains susceptible to significant data breaches and operational disruptions.</p>
