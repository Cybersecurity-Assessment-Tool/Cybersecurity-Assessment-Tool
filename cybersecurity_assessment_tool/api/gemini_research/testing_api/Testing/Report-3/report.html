        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to security awareness training, conducting it for both new and existing employees annually, and enforces Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. However, critical gaps exist in MFA implementation for email and sensitive data systems. A network scan identified an open MySQL port (3306), posing a significant risk of unauthorized database access.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network. This allows external entities to potentially connect to the database, leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, or service disruption. This vulnerability was identified through a network port scan.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted internal IP addresses or specific authorized services. For long-term security, consider placing the database behind a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or implementing a secure bastion host for access. Furthermore, it is crucial to extend Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) requirements to all email accounts and sensitive data systems to significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has a commendable foundation in security awareness training and MFA for computer logins, the presence of an openly accessible MySQL database port and the absence of MFA for email and sensitive data systems represent critical vulnerabilities. Addressing these gaps, particularly the database exposure and MFA implementation, is paramount to enhancing the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and protecting its sensitive assets from potential threats.</p>
