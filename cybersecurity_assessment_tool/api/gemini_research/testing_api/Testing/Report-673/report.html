        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Based on the network scan, the organization operates at least one host with an open port 443, running an outdated Nginx web server (version 1.18.0). This indicates a public-facing web service. Furthermore, an assessment of organizational practices reveals critical deficiencies in security controls, including a complete lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems, and a significant absence of foundational security policies and employee training programs.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Nginx Server - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nginx web server identified on port 443 is version 1.18.0. This version has reached its end-of-life and no longer receives security updates, making it vulnerable to known exploits. Running outdated software significantly increases the risk of compromise, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, or denial of service attacks. This was identified through the Nmap scan data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with open port 443</li><li>Nginx 1.18.0</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This leaves employee email accounts highly susceptible to compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. A compromised email account can be used for internal phishing, impersonation, or to gain access to other linked services, posing a significant risk to organizational security. This was identified from the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This is a critical vulnerability, as it means that if primary credentials are stolen or guessed, attackers can gain direct access to highly sensitive information. This significantly increases the risk of severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and reputational damage. This was identified from the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines, employees may inadvertently introduce security risks by engaging in unauthorized activities, using unapproved software, or mishandling company data. This increases the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents and makes it difficult to enforce consistent security practices. This was identified from the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training. This means individuals are onboarded without essential knowledge of cybersecurity threats, organizational policies, and their role in maintaining security. This significantly elevates the risk of new employees falling victim to social engineering attacks or making critical security errors from the outset. This was identified from the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. Regular training is crucial for keeping employees informed about evolving threats, reinforcing best practices, and fostering a strong security culture. The absence of such ongoing training leads to a degradation of security knowledge and an increased susceptibility to various cyber threats over time. This was identified from the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, the organization should immediately update the Nginx server on port 443 to the latest stable version and implement a robust patch management process for all software. Crucially, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be mandated for all email accounts and access to sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access. Furthermore, the organization needs to develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy. Finally, a mandatory security awareness training program should be established for all new employees during onboarding, complemented by annual refresher training for all staff to ensure ongoing awareness of current threats and best practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently exhibits a low state of cybersecurity readiness, facing significant risks from both technical vulnerabilities and critical gaps in its security posture. The outdated Nginx server presents an immediate technical threat, while the complete absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for critical systems and a lack of fundamental security policies and employee training expose the organization to a high probability of credential compromise, data breaches, and human-factor-related security incidents. Addressing these foundational weaknesses is essential to establish a defensible security posture and protect organizational assets effectively.</p>
