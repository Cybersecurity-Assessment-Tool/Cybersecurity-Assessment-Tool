        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Based on the provided organizational data, the network's security posture regarding access controls and user policies can be assessed. While the organization has good practices in place for employee acceptable use policies and regular security awareness training, there are significant gaps in multi-factor authentication (MFA) implementation. The network scan data and specific technical vulnerabilities could not be assessed due to broken input.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. Email accounts often contain sensitive information and can be used as a pivot point for further attacks within the network. This was identified directly from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>User accounts</li><li>Communication channels</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk, as compromised credentials for these systems could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, data exfiltration, or data manipulation. Sensitive data systems typically house an organization's most valuable assets, making their protection paramount. This was identified directly from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>It is strongly recommended that the organization implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and, critically, for all sensitive data systems. For email, this will significantly reduce the risk of account compromise and subsequent phishing attacks. For sensitive data systems, MFA will provide an essential layer of defense against unauthorized access to critical organizational assets. Furthermore, a comprehensive technical vulnerability scan should be conducted to identify and address any network-level or application-specific vulnerabilities that could not be assessed in this report due to missing data. Regular reviews of access control policies and continuous security awareness training should also be maintained.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security through its acceptable use policy and consistent security awareness training. However, a critical gap exists in the implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication for email and sensitive data systems, which presents a significant attack vector for credential-based compromises and potential data breaches. Addressing these MFA deficiencies is paramount to enhancing the overall security posture and readiness against modern cyber threats. A full technical assessment is needed to provide a complete picture of network vulnerabilities.</p>
