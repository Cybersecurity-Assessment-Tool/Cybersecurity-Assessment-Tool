        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>This cybersecurity assessment is based primarily on organizational policy and practice data, as network scan data and detailed vulnerability reports were unavailable. The organization demonstrates some foundational security practices, such as requiring multi-factor authentication (MFA) for computer logins and conducting annual security awareness training for all employees. However, significant gaps exist in critical areas, including the application of MFA for email and sensitive data systems, the presence of an acceptable use policy, and security awareness training for new employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require multi-factor authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. A compromised email account can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, or serve as a pivot point for further attacks within the network. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on email access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>All employee email accounts</li><li>Organizational communication</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-factor authentication is not required to access sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk, as unauthorized access to these systems could lead to severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, financial loss, and reputational damage. Without MFA, a single compromised credential could grant an attacker full access to highly confidential information. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on sensitive data systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases containing confidential information</li><li>User accounts with access to sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy (AUP). Without clear guidelines, employees may unknowingly engage in activities that introduce security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling company data. This absence increases the likelihood of insider threats, malware infections, and data leakage due to a lack of defined boundaries for technology usage. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for an employee acceptable use policy.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational network</li><li>Company devices and data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training upon joining the organization. This leaves new hires vulnerable to social engineering attacks, phishing attempts, and other common cyber threats from day one. Without initial training, new employees may not be aware of organizational security policies, best practices, or how to identify and report suspicious activities, making them potential weak links in the security chain. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for security awareness training for new employees.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational systems and data</li><li>Overall security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and sensitive data systems immediately. This will provide a crucial layer of defense against credential theft. Furthermore, the organization should develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy (AUP) to clearly define expected behavior and responsibilities regarding technology and data handling. Mandatory security awareness training for all new employees must be introduced to ensure they are equipped with essential cybersecurity knowledge from the start. While annual training is in place, consider supplementing it with more frequent, targeted micro-training modules on emerging threats.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to critical gaps in multi-factor authentication implementation for email and sensitive data systems, as well as the absence of foundational security policies like an acceptable use policy and initial security awareness training for new hires. While the existing MFA for computer logins and annual security training are positive steps, these do not sufficiently mitigate the identified high and critical risks. Addressing these vulnerabilities is paramount to protecting organizational assets, sensitive data, and maintaining operational integrity.</p>
