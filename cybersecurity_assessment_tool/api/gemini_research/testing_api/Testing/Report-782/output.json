            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to security through its widespread implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, as well as having an employee acceptable use policy. However, a critical vulnerability was identified: an outdated FTP server (vsftpd 2.3.4) with anonymous login enabled, posing a significant risk to data confidentiality and integrity. Furthermore, the organization is running outdated Windows 7 operating systems on its workstations, which are no longer supported and lack critical security updates. A gap in security awareness training was also noted, as annual training is not conducted for all employees.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Anonymous FTP Access & Outdated FTP Server",
                        "Overview": "A network scan revealed an open FTP service (vsftpd 2.3.4) configured to allow anonymous logins. This version of vsftpd is severely outdated and contains numerous known vulnerabilities, including remote code execution and denial-of-service flaws. The anonymous access further exacerbates the risk by allowing unauthorized users to potentially upload, download, or modify files without authentication, leading to data breaches, system compromise, or the introduction of malicious content. This vulnerability was identified via an Nmap scan detecting port 21 open with 'vsftpd 2.3.4' and 'ftp-anon' script output indicating anonymous login allowed.",

                        "Risk": "Outdated Windows Policy",
                        "Overview": "Several computers within the organization are still running Windows 7. This operating system has reached its end-of-life and no longer receives security updates from Microsoft. This leaves these workstations highly vulnerable to new exploits, malware, and other cyber threats, as patches for discovered vulnerabilities are not released. The impact could range from individual workstation compromise to a broader network infection if an attacker leverages these unpatched systems as an entry point. This vulnerability was identified through internal risk assessment data.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                    {
                        "Risk": "Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "While the organization conducts security awareness training for new employees, it does not provide annual security awareness training for all employees. This oversight leaves the workforce susceptible to evolving social engineering attacks, phishing attempts, and other human-centric vulnerabilities. Without regular reinforcement and updates on current threats, employees may inadvertently become the weakest link in the security chain, leading to incidents like credential compromise or malware infections. This was identified from the organizational data indicating 'Does your organization do security awareness training for all employees at least once per year?': 'No'.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All Employees",
                            "Organizational Data Security"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately disable anonymous FTP access and either decommission the vsftpd 2.3.4 server or upgrade it to a current, supported version with proper authentication and access controls. All workstations running Windows 7 must be upgraded to a supported operating system, such as Windows 10 or newer, to ensure they receive critical security updates. Furthermore, the organization should implement a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees, covering current threat landscapes and best practices to foster a strong security culture.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization has a solid foundation in some areas of cybersecurity, particularly with its robust MFA implementation and acceptable use policy. However, the presence of a critical anonymous FTP vulnerability, outdated operating systems on workstations, and a lack of comprehensive annual security awareness training significantly undermine its overall security posture. Addressing these high-priority vulnerabilities is crucial to protect organizational assets from potential cyber threats and improve overall readiness."
