        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan data indicates no open ports on the scanned hosts, suggesting a basic level of external network security. However, an assessment of organizational practices reveals significant gaps in multi-factor authentication (MFA) implementation and new employee security awareness training. While an acceptable use policy is in place and annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees, the absence of MFA for critical access points and initial security training for new hires presents considerable internal and external risks.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee inboxes if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. A single compromised email account can lead to further internal network breaches, data exfiltration, or business email compromise (BEC) scams. Identified via organizational survey data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>employee accounts</li><li>sensitive communications</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for logging into organizational computers. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if employee login credentials are stolen or guessed. An attacker gaining access to a computer can potentially move laterally within the network, access sensitive data, or deploy malware. Identified via organizational survey data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All organizational computers</li><li>employee accounts</li><li>internal network</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate New Employee Security Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees upon onboarding. While annual training is provided, new hires are immediately exposed to organizational systems and data without foundational security knowledge, increasing the likelihood of them falling victim to social engineering attacks, mishandling sensitive information, or introducing vulnerabilities through insecure practices during their initial employment period. Identified via organizational survey data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>organizational data</li><li>internal systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points. Specifically, MFA should be mandated for email access and computer logins to prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised. Furthermore, a comprehensive security awareness training program for all new employees must be established as part of the onboarding process to ensure they are equipped with essential cybersecurity knowledge from day one. Regular, engaging security awareness training should also continue for all employees annually, reinforcing best practices and addressing emerging threats. Review and update the acceptable use policy regularly to reflect current threats and technologies.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently exhibits a mixed security posture. While external network scans show no immediate open port vulnerabilities, significant internal risks stem from the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for email and computer access, which are critical entry points for attackers. Additionally, the absence of initial security awareness training for new employees creates a window of vulnerability. Addressing these gaps through robust MFA implementation and comprehensive onboarding security training is crucial for improving overall readiness against common cyber threats and protecting sensitive organizational assets.</p>
