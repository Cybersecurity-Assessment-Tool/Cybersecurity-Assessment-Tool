        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. However, significant gaps exist in critical areas, including the absence of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, which exposes core assets to credential-based attacks. Furthermore, the lack of an employee acceptable use policy and annual security awareness training indicates a need for improved human-centric security controls. A network scan revealed an open SSH port (22), which, if not adequately secured, represents a direct entry point for potential attackers.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for employees to log into their computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if employee credentials are compromised through phishing, malware, or other means. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's workstation and potentially facilitate lateral movement within the network. This vulnerability was identified through a review of organizational security policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Internal network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Sensitive data systems within the organization do not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). This critical oversight means that systems containing valuable or regulated data are protected only by single-factor authentication. A breach of these systems could lead to severe data loss, regulatory non-compliance, financial penalties, and significant reputational damage. This vulnerability was identified through a review of organizational security policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Databases containing sensitive data</li><li>File servers with confidential information</li><li>CRM systems</li><li>HR systems</li><li>Financial applications</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines, employees may unknowingly engage in activities that introduce security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive data. This absence of policy increases the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents, data breaches, or malware infections. This vulnerability was identified through a review of organizational security policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network resources</li><li>IT infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. Regular training is essential to educate employees about evolving cyber threats, such as phishing, social engineering, and malware, and to reinforce secure computing practices. The lack of annual training leaves employees more susceptible to common attack vectors, increasing the risk of successful cyberattacks that exploit human vulnerabilities. This vulnerability was identified through a review of organizational security policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network security</li><li>Email systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port (22) - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A network scan identified an open SSH port (22) on a host. While SSH is a legitimate service for secure remote access, an open port represents a potential attack surface if not properly secured. Without robust configurations (e.g., strong passwords, key-based authentication, restricted IP access, rate limiting), this port can be targeted by brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or other exploits to gain unauthorized remote access to the system. This vulnerability was identified via an Nmap network scan.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with open port 22</li><li>Network perimeter</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and access to sensitive data systems immediately. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to guide appropriate technology usage and mitigate human-related risks. Establish a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees to keep them informed about current threats and best practices. For the identified open SSH port (22), ensure it is secured with strong, key-based authentication, disable password authentication, restrict access to trusted IP addresses only, and consider implementing a robust intrusion detection/prevention system to monitor and block malicious attempts.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several significant cybersecurity risks, primarily stemming from insufficient implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication for critical access points and a lack of comprehensive human-centric security policies and training. While MFA for email is a positive step, the absence of it for computer logins and sensitive data systems, coupled with an open SSH port, creates substantial attack vectors. The lack of an acceptable use policy and annual security awareness training further exacerbates these risks by increasing the likelihood of human error and successful social engineering attacks. Addressing these vulnerabilities is crucial for improving the organization's overall security readiness and protecting its assets from potential cyber threats.</p>
