        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network was assessed based on provided organizational data and an empty network scan. While no technical vulnerabilities were identified through the provided scan data, the organization demonstrates a mixed security posture regarding access controls and employee training. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is implemented for computer logins and sensitive data systems, which is a strong control. However, MFA is not required for email access. An acceptable use policy is in place, and annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees, but new employees do not receive dedicated security awareness training upon onboarding.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee inboxes if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. Email accounts often serve as a gateway to other systems (e.g., password resets), making their compromise a critical entry point for attackers. This was identified through the organizational data indicating "Do you require MFA to access email?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees are not provided with dedicated security awareness training upon onboarding. This leaves them vulnerable to common social engineering tactics, phishing attempts, and other cybersecurity threats during their initial period with the organization. Without foundational knowledge of security best practices, new hires may inadvertently introduce risks or fall victim to attacks, potentially compromising organizational data or systems. This was identified through the organizational data indicating "Does your organization do security awareness training for new employees?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>organizational data</li><li>network security</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access. This critical control will significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access to email accounts, even if primary credentials are stolen. Additionally, the organization should establish and enforce mandatory security awareness training for all new employees as part of their onboarding process. This training should cover essential topics such as phishing recognition, password hygiene, data handling policies, and incident reporting procedures to ensure new hires are equipped with the necessary knowledge to protect organizational assets from day one. Regular review and updates to security policies and training content are also advised to adapt to evolving threat landscapes.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Based on the assessment, the organization currently exhibits a moderate level of cybersecurity readiness. While strong controls like MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, along with annual security awareness training, are in place, critical gaps exist. Specifically, the absence of MFA for email access and dedicated security awareness training for new employees presents significant vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors. Addressing these areas is crucial for bolstering the organization's defenses against common cyber threats and improving its overall security posture.</p>
