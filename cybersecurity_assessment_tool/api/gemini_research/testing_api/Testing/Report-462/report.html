        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization currently implements Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems. However, MFA is not required for computer logins, which presents a significant authentication vulnerability. While new employees receive initial security awareness training, there is no annual training for all employees, leading to potential knowledge degradation. A critical policy gap is the absence of an employee acceptable use policy. Network scans indicate that common web server ports, such as port 80, are closed, suggesting no immediate external web server vulnerabilities were identified through this scan.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Authentication for Workstations - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication. Attackers gaining access to a single set of credentials could potentially compromise an employee's workstation and gain further access to the internal network.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee workstations</li><li>Identity Provider/Active Directory (if applicable)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. Without a clear AUP, employees may be unaware of their responsibilities regarding company assets, data handling, internet usage, and security best practices. This can lead to misuse of resources, inadvertent data breaches, and non-compliance with industry regulations, as there are no defined guidelines for acceptable conduct.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT assets</li><li>Data handling procedures</li><li>Organizational compliance</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual training for all employees. This leads to a degradation of security knowledge over time, making employees more susceptible to evolving social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, vishing), malware, and other human-factor vulnerabilities. A lack of consistent training weakens the human firewall, which is often the first line of defense.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li><li>Security culture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins. This will provide a crucial layer of defense against compromised credentials. Developing and enforcing a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy is paramount to establish clear guidelines for employee conduct, protect company assets, and ensure data integrity. Furthermore, establishing a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees will help maintain a high level of security consciousness, keep employees informed about new threats, and significantly reduce the risk of human-factor incidents like phishing and malware infections.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security by implementing MFA for critical systems and providing initial security awareness training for new hires. However, significant vulnerabilities persist due to the lack of MFA for computer access, the absence of a formal acceptable use policy, and the failure to provide ongoing annual security awareness training for all staff. Addressing these identified areas is essential to strengthen the overall security posture, mitigate common attack vectors, and foster a more robust security culture within the organization.</p>
