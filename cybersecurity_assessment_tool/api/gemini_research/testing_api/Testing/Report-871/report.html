        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to multi-factor authentication (MFA), implementing it for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. They also conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. However, there are notable gaps in their security posture, including the absence of an employee acceptable use policy and a lack of dedicated security awareness training for new employees. Network scanning identified an open SSH port (22), which, while not inherently a vulnerability, represents a potential attack surface if not adequately secured. The organization's current risk profile indicates a good foundation in some areas but significant weaknesses in policy and initial employee training.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The network scan identified an open SSH port (22) on one of the hosts. While SSH is a legitimate service for secure remote access, an open port can be a target for brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or exploitation of SSH vulnerabilities if not properly configured and secured. This increases the attack surface for unauthorized access to the system. The risk was identified via an Nmap scan.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with open port 22</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This absence means there are no formal guidelines or rules defining how employees should use company IT resources, including networks, devices, and data. This can lead to misuse of company assets, increased risk of data breaches due to unauthorized activities, and a lack of legal recourse in cases of employee misconduct related to IT systems. This risk was identified through organizational data indicating 'No' for 'Does your organization have an employee acceptable use policy?'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Data security</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often a primary target for social engineering attacks, phishing, and other human-factor exploits due to their unfamiliarity with organizational security protocols and common threats. Without immediate training, new employees pose an elevated risk of inadvertently compromising company security, leading to potential data breaches, malware infections, or unauthorized access. This risk was identified through organizational data indicating 'No' for 'Does your organization do security awareness training for new employees?'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li><li>Data integrity</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement an employee acceptable use policy immediately. This policy should clearly outline expectations for the use of company IT resources, data handling, and internet usage. Furthermore, integrate mandatory security awareness training into the onboarding process for all new employees to educate them on common threats like phishing, social engineering, and best practices for data protection. For the identified open SSH port, ensure it is secured by disabling root login, enforcing strong password policies or, preferably, using key-based authentication, and restricting access to a whitelist of trusted IP addresses. Regularly patch and update SSH servers to mitigate known vulnerabilities.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In conclusion, the organization has established a commendable baseline with widespread MFA adoption and annual security awareness training. However, critical vulnerabilities exist due to the absence of an employee acceptable use policy and dedicated security awareness training for new hires, which significantly elevate human-factor risks. The open SSH port also presents a potential network entry point that requires immediate hardening. Addressing these policy and training gaps, alongside securing network services, is paramount to achieving a robust and resilient cybersecurity posture.</p>
