        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization operates a network with at least one active host exposing an open HTTP port (80). While an employee acceptable use policy is in place and annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees, critical gaps exist in the overall security posture. Specifically, the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, and the lack of security awareness training for new employees, represent significant vulnerabilities that could be exploited.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing, potentially leading to data breaches, business email compromise (BEC), and further network penetration. This was identified from the 'Org Data' indicating 'Do you require MFA to access email?': 'No'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This leaves employee workstations vulnerable to unauthorized access if credentials are compromised, potentially allowing attackers to gain a foothold within the internal network, access sensitive data, and deploy malware. This was identified from the 'Org Data' indicating 'Do you require MFA to log into computers?': 'No'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Internal network access</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Onboarding Security Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees upon joining. This leaves new hires susceptible to social engineering attacks, phishing, and other common threats due to a lack of immediate awareness regarding organizational security policies and best practices. This was identified from the 'Org Data' indicating 'Does your organization do security awareness training for new employees?': 'No'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open HTTP Port (80) - <span class="severity-Low">Low</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A network scan revealed an open port 80 (HTTP) on at least one host. While not inherently a vulnerability, running services over unencrypted HTTP can expose sensitive information to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. It also indicates a potential web server that might have underlying vulnerabilities if not properly secured and patched. This was identified via Nmap scan data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with port 80 open</li><li>Web server</li><li>Network traffic</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and computer logins. This critical step will drastically reduce the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials. Furthermore, a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees should be established as part of their onboarding process to ensure immediate awareness of security best practices. Finally, any services currently running on unencrypted HTTP (port 80) should be migrated to HTTPS (port 443) to protect data in transit, and the underlying web servers must be regularly patched and securely configured.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In conclusion, while the organization demonstrates some foundational security practices such as an acceptable use policy and annual security awareness training, critical vulnerabilities exist that significantly elevate its risk profile. The absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for email and computer logins, coupled with a lack of dedicated security awareness training for new employees, creates substantial entry points for attackers. Additionally, the presence of an open HTTP port warrants attention for secure configuration and encryption. Addressing these key areas is paramount to improving the overall cybersecurity readiness and resilience of the organization.</p>
