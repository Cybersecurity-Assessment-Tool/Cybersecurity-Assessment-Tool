            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network shows an open RDP port (3389), indicating potential external exposure. Internally, the organization utilizes MFA for email and computer logins, but not for sensitive data systems. An acceptable use policy is in place, and annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees, though new employees do not receive specific security awareness training upon onboarding.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "RDP Exposure",
                        "Overview": "Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed externally on an identified IP address. This allows potential attackers to attempt to brute-force RDP credentials or exploit vulnerabilities in the RDP service, leading to unauthorized access to internal systems. This was identified via network scanning showing port 3389 open.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "IP"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "It is strongly recommended to immediately close the externally exposed RDP port (3389) to mitigate the critical risk of unauthorized access. For long-term secure remote access, implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution that requires strong authentication. Additionally, extend Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to all sensitive data systems to enhance protection against unauthorized access. Implement security awareness training for new employees during their onboarding process to ensure a consistent baseline of security knowledge across the organization.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization faces a critical vulnerability due to an exposed RDP port, which could lead to significant security breaches. While some security controls like MFA for email and computer logins, and annual security training are in place, the lack of MFA for sensitive data systems and onboarding security training for new employees represents gaps in the overall security posture. Addressing these vulnerabilities and implementing the recommended controls is crucial to improve the organization's cybersecurity readiness."
