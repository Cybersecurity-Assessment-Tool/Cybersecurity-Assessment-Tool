        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network, based on the provided scan data, appears to have a closed external perimeter with no open ports detected. However, the internal security posture reveals significant weaknesses, particularly concerning user authentication and employee security awareness. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not enforced for email access or computer logins, leaving critical entry points vulnerable to credential-based attacks. Furthermore, the absence of an employee acceptable use policy and any form of security awareness training (for new hires or annually for all staff) indicates a substantial gap in human-centric security controls, increasing the risk of social engineering and internal policy violations. While sensitive data systems reportedly require MFA, the lack of it for email and computer access creates a broad attack surface.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Without Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access, accounts are highly susceptible to credential stuffing, phishing, and brute-force attacks. A compromised email account can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and further network penetration, as email is often a primary vector for initial access and communication. This vulnerability was identified by the organization stating they do not require MFA for email.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee email accounts</li><li>Email servers</li><li>Organizational data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Not requiring MFA for computer logins significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to internal systems if credentials are stolen or guessed. This can lead to lateral movement within the network, installation of malicious software, data breaches, and system compromise, as a single compromised password can grant access to an endpoint. This vulnerability was identified by the organization stating they do not require MFA for computer logins.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network resources</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The lack of an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) means there are no clear, documented guidelines for employees on the proper and secure use of company IT resources, including internet, email, and hardware. This can lead to misuse of company assets, increased risk of malware infections from unauthorized software or websites, data leakage, and potential legal liabilities, as employees may unknowingly engage in risky behaviors. This vulnerability was identified by the organization stating they do not have an AUP.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All IT systems</li><li>Employee devices</li><li>Network infrastructure</li><li>Organizational data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees, without initial security awareness training, are more likely to fall victim to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) or make security mistakes due to a lack of understanding of organizational security policies, common threats, and best practices. This significantly increases the risk of initial compromise and internal threats from a lack of foundational security knowledge. This vulnerability was identified by the organization stating they do not conduct security awareness training for new employees.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Email systems</li><li>Internal applications</li><li>Organizational data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The absence of regular (at least annual) security awareness training means employees' knowledge of current threats, evolving attack techniques, and updated security best practices can become outdated. This leads to a degradation of the 'human firewall,' increasing the overall susceptibility to evolving cyber threats and reducing the organization's ability to detect and respond to incidents effectively. This vulnerability was identified by the organization stating they do not conduct annual security awareness training.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li><li>Incident response capabilities</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and computer logins. This critical step will significantly enhance protection against credential theft. Concurrently, develop and enforce a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) to clearly define expectations for IT resource usage and minimize misuse. Establish a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees during their onboarding process, covering essential cybersecurity principles and organizational policies. Furthermore, implement annual refresher security awareness training for all employees to ensure their knowledge of current threats and best practices remains up-to-date, fostering a strong security culture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to a lack of fundamental security controls related to user authentication and employee awareness. While the external network perimeter appears closed, the internal environment is highly vulnerable to credential-based attacks and human error. The absence of MFA for email and computer logins, coupled with no security awareness training or an acceptable use policy, indicates a low state of readiness against common cyber threats. Addressing these foundational weaknesses is paramount to improving the overall security posture and reducing the likelihood of a successful cyberattack.</p>
