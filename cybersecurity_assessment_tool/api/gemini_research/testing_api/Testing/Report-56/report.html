        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The network assessment revealed an active host with an open port 80, indicating a potential web service or unencrypted traffic exposure. Organizational data indicates a mixed security posture: while the organization implements security awareness training for all employees and maintains an acceptable use policy, critical gaps exist in Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) implementation for email access and sensitive data systems. MFA is currently only required for computer logins.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks. A compromised email account can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and serve as a pivot point for further network penetration.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee email accounts</li><li>User credentials</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not enforced for accessing systems containing sensitive data. This leaves critical organizational data vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are compromised. The impact could include data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, financial losses, and severe reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>Critical applications</li><li>Confidential information</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unencrypted Web Traffic (Open Port 80) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A network scan identified an open port 80 (HTTP) on an active host. If a web service is running on this port without redirection to HTTPS, or if HTTPS is not enforced, any data transmitted over this connection (including login credentials, personal information, or sensitive business data) would be unencrypted. This makes the traffic susceptible to eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attacks, and data tampering.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with open port 80</li><li>Any web applications or services exposed via HTTP</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points. Specifically, MFA should be mandated for all email access to mitigate the risk of account compromise and for all sensitive data systems to protect critical information from unauthorized access. Furthermore, the host with an open port 80 should be investigated. If a web service is present, ensure that all traffic is encrypted using HTTPS, with HTTP traffic being redirected to HTTPS. If the port is not intentionally open, it should be closed or filtered. Regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing should be conducted to identify and address new or evolving risks.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security through its employee acceptable use policy and consistent security awareness training. However, significant vulnerabilities exist due to the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for email and sensitive data systems, which are critical controls against credential-based attacks. The presence of an open HTTP port also indicates a potential for unencrypted data transmission. Addressing these key areas will substantially improve the organization's readiness against common cyber threats and strengthen its overall security posture.</p>
