        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's external network footprint appears minimal, with only HTTPS (port 443) exposed, running Nginx version 1.18.0. Internally, the organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and computer logins, which is a strong security practice. However, critical gaps exist in securing access to sensitive data systems, employee policy enforcement, and ongoing security awareness training, indicating a need for improved internal security posture and software lifecycle management.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if primary credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or malware. Without MFA, a single compromised password can lead to a data breach, impacting data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on sensitive data systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy (AUP). An AUP is crucial for defining the expected behavior of employees when using company IT resources, including internet, email, and hardware. Without clear guidelines, employees may unknowingly engage in risky activities, such as visiting malicious websites, downloading unauthorized software, or mishandling company data, leading to increased exposure to cyber threats and potential legal liabilities. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for an AUP.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Network security</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Infrequent Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. Cyber threats constantly evolve, and regular training is essential to keep employees informed about new attack vectors (e.g., advanced phishing techniques, social engineering) and best practices for data protection. Infrequent training leads to a decline in security vigilance, making employees more susceptible to human-factor attacks, which remain a primary entry point for breaches. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for annual training for all employees.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Web Server Software - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nginx web server running on port 443 is version 1.18.0. This version was released in April 2020 and is no longer the latest stable release. Running outdated software can expose the organization to known vulnerabilities (CVEs) that have been discovered and patched in newer versions. Attackers frequently target unpatched software to gain unauthorized access, execute malicious code, or disrupt services. While no specific CVE was identified in the scan, the general practice of not keeping software updated poses a significant risk. This was identified through the Nmap scan data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Web server (Nginx 1.18.0)</li><li>HTTPS service (port 443)</li><li>Web applications hosted on Nginx</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems immediately to prevent unauthorized access. Develop and enforce a comprehensive Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) for all employees, clearly outlining expectations for IT resource usage to minimize risky behaviors. Furthermore, establish a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees to ensure they are continuously updated on the latest cyber threats and best practices. Finally, regularly update all software, including the Nginx web server, to the latest stable versions to patch known vulnerabilities and benefit from security enhancements. Implement a robust patch management process to ensure timely updates across all systems.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing MFA for email and computer logins and providing initial security training for new hires. However, significant vulnerabilities exist in the areas of sensitive data access control, employee policy, ongoing security education, and software patch management. Addressing these critical gaps by implementing MFA for sensitive data, establishing an AUP, conducting regular security training, and maintaining up-to-date software is crucial for improving the overall cybersecurity readiness and reducing the risk of a successful cyberattack.</p>
