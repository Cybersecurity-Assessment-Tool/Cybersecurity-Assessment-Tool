        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>A recent network scan of the organization's infrastructure revealed that the target host had no open ports, with port 80 specifically identified as closed. However, an assessment of the organization's security policies and practices identified several critical areas for improvement. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required for email access, it is not mandated for computer logins or sensitive data systems. The organization also lacks an an employee acceptable use policy and does not provide security awareness training for new employees, although annual training is conducted for all existing staff.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unencrypted Web Server - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Port 80 is open, indicating a web server is running without encryption. This exposes all traffic, including sensitive data like login credentials, to potential eavesdropping and interception. This vulnerability was identified through a security assessment.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication. This was identified through a review of organizational security policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers</li><li>Login systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access should a single set of credentials be compromised, potentially leading to data breaches and regulatory non-compliance. This was identified through a review of organizational security policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases containing sensitive information</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines, employees may inadvertently misuse company IT resources, leading to increased risks of data leakage, malware infections, and non-compliance with security best practices. This was identified through a review of organizational security policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>IT resource usage</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive mandatory security awareness training upon joining the organization. This leaves new hires susceptible to common social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) and unaware of critical security protocols, increasing the overall human risk factor for the organization. This was identified through a review of organizational security policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and access to sensitive data systems without delay. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy (AUP) that clearly outlines acceptable conduct and usage of company IT resources. Establish and mandate security awareness training for all new employees as part of their onboarding process, covering topics such as phishing, password hygiene, and data handling. Regarding the unencrypted web server, if port 80 is indeed open, it must be immediately closed or secured with SSL/TLS encryption to protect data in transit. Long-term, consider regular policy reviews and advanced security awareness programs, including simulated phishing exercises, for all staff.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several significant security vulnerabilities primarily stemming from policy and procedural gaps, despite a clean network scan showing no open ports. While MFA is utilized for email and annual security training is provided, the absence of MFA for computer and sensitive data system access, the lack of an acceptable use policy, and the omission of new employee security training collectively present a substantial risk to data integrity, confidentiality, and overall operational security. Addressing these foundational security practices is paramount to improving the organization's cybersecurity posture and readiness against evolving threats.</p>
