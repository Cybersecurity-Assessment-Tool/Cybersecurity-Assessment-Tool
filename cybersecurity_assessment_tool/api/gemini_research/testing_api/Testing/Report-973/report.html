        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes an Nginx web server (version 1.18.0) on port 443, indicating a public-facing web presence. Internally, the organization lacks fundamental security controls, notably the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, there is no established employee acceptable use policy, and new employees do not receive security awareness training upon onboarding, although annual training is provided for all existing employees. These factors collectively point to significant vulnerabilities in both technical infrastructure and organizational security practices.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Nginx Server - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nginx web server running version 1.18.0 is outdated. This version was released in April 2020 and is no longer actively maintained, meaning it is susceptible to known vulnerabilities that have been discovered and patched in newer releases. Exploiting such vulnerabilities could lead to unauthorized access, denial of service, or compromise of the web server and potentially other connected systems. This was identified via the Nmap scan.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Nginx 1.18.0 server on port 443</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for accessing email, logging into computers, or accessing sensitive data systems. This critical weakness means that if an attacker obtains a single set of credentials (e.g., through phishing or brute-force attacks), they can gain full unauthorized access to these systems without an additional layer of security. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise and data breaches. This was identified from the organization's self-reported data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email systems</li><li>Employee computers</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The absence of an acceptable use policy leaves a significant gap in defining expected employee behavior regarding the use of company IT resources. Without clear guidelines, employees may inadvertently engage in risky activities, such as visiting malicious websites, downloading unauthorized software, or mishandling sensitive data, increasing the likelihood of malware infections, data leakage, and compliance violations. This was identified from the organization's self-reported data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All IT resources</li><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network infrastructure</li><li>Sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees are not provided with security awareness training upon onboarding. This means that individuals new to the organization may be unaware of common cyber threats, company-specific security protocols, and best practices from their first day. This increases the risk of new hires falling victim to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) or making security errors that could compromise the organization's systems or data. This was identified from the organization's self-reported data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employee accounts</li><li>Company network</li><li>Sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately upgrade the Nginx web server to the latest stable version to address known vulnerabilities. Implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical systems, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data access, is paramount to significantly enhance authentication security. The organization should develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to guide appropriate behavior and reduce human-factor risks. Furthermore, mandatory security awareness training must be introduced for all new employees during their onboarding process to ensure they are equipped with essential cybersecurity knowledge from day one. Continuing the annual security awareness training for all employees is also crucial for ongoing vigilance.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces a combination of technical and procedural vulnerabilities that significantly elevate its cybersecurity risk profile. The presence of an outdated Nginx server, coupled with the critical absence of Multi-Factor Authentication across key systems, creates easily exploitable entry points for attackers. Furthermore, the lack of an acceptable use policy and initial security training for new employees indicates a gap in foundational security practices. Addressing these issues through immediate system upgrades, robust authentication implementation, and comprehensive policy and training initiatives is essential to improve the organization's overall security posture and readiness against cyber threats.</p>
