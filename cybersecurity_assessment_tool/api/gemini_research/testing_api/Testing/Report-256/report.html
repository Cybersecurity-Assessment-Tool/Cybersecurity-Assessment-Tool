        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The network scan data provided is minimal, indicating no open ports, which is a positive baseline. However, the organizational data reveals significant gaps in foundational security practices. Specifically, the organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access, computer logins, or sensitive data systems. Furthermore, there is no formal employee acceptable use policy in place, and new employees do not receive dedicated security awareness training upon onboarding, although annual training is conducted for all employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if primary credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. A single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to sensitive data, leading to severe data breaches and compliance violations.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts</li><li>Organizational data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not enforced for email access. Email accounts are frequently targeted by attackers as they often contain sensitive communications, password reset links, and serve as a gateway to other services. Without MFA, a compromised email password can lead to widespread account takeovers, business email compromise (BEC) attacks, and further lateral movement within the organization's digital infrastructure.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email accounts</li><li>User identities</li><li>Communication channels</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if a user's login credentials are stolen or guessed. An attacker gaining access to a workstation could then move laterally within the network, escalate privileges, and access sensitive resources, potentially leading to data exfiltration or system compromise.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network access</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines, employees may unknowingly engage in activities that pose security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling company data. This absence creates ambiguity regarding expected behavior, makes it difficult to enforce security standards, and increases the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee behavior</li><li>Network resources</li><li>Data handling practices</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate New Employee Security Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive dedicated security awareness training upon joining the organization. This means new hires may not be immediately aware of critical security policies, common threats (like phishing and social engineering), or best practices for data handling. This oversight creates a significant window of vulnerability where new employees are more susceptible to social engineering attacks or unintentional security breaches before they receive annual training.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security culture</li><li>Susceptibility to social engineering</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, including sensitive data systems, email accounts, and computer logins. A comprehensive employee acceptable use policy should be developed, clearly communicated, and enforced to establish clear guidelines for employee conduct regarding IT resources and data handling. Furthermore, mandatory security awareness training for all new employees must be established as part of the onboarding process, complementing the existing annual training to ensure immediate awareness of security best practices and threats.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant procedural security risks due to the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for critical systems, a lack of a formal acceptable use policy, and insufficient security awareness training for new hires. While the network scan did not reveal immediate technical vulnerabilities, these foundational gaps in security practices leave the organization highly susceptible to credential-based attacks, insider threats, and human error. Addressing these policy and training deficiencies is paramount to improving the overall security posture and readiness against common cyber threats, ensuring a more robust defense against potential breaches.</p>
