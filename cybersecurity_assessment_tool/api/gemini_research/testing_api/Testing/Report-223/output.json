            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network scan identified an open SSH port (22). From an organizational policy standpoint, the company has an acceptable use policy in place and conducts annual security awareness training for all employees. However, significant security gaps were identified concerning the implementation of multi-factor authentication (MFA) for critical systems and the provision of initial security awareness training for new hires.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Email Access",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee inboxes if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. A single compromised email account can lead to further attacks, data exfiltration, or business email compromise (BEC) scams. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on email.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Email system",
                            "Employee accounts",
                            "Organizational data"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems",
                        "Overview": "Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not mandated for accessing systems containing sensitive data. This leaves critical information vulnerable to unauthorized access should a user's primary credentials be compromised. Attackers gaining access to these systems could lead to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, financial loss, and reputational damage. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on sensitive data systems.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Sensitive data systems",
                            "Databases",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Inadequate Security Awareness Training for New Employees",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not provide security awareness training specifically for new employees upon onboarding. While annual training is conducted for all employees, the absence of initial training leaves new hires vulnerable to social engineering attacks, phishing, and other common threats during their critical initial period. New employees may not be aware of organizational security policies, best practices, or how to identify and report suspicious activities, thereby increasing the human element risk. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for security awareness training for new employees.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "Organizational network",
                            "Data",
                            "Systems"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and sensitive data systems without delay. This critical control will drastically reduce the risk of unauthorized access even if primary credentials are stolen. Furthermore, a mandatory security awareness training program should be established for all new employees as part of their onboarding process, covering essential security policies, threat identification, and reporting procedures. Regular review and updates of security policies and training content are also advised to address evolving threats.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces significant security risks primarily due to the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for email and sensitive data systems, alongside a critical gap in initial security awareness training for new employees. While some foundational security practices are in place, these identified vulnerabilities expose the organization to a high risk of credential compromise, unauthorized data access, and successful social engineering attacks. Addressing these issues promptly is crucial for improving overall cybersecurity readiness and protecting organizational assets."
