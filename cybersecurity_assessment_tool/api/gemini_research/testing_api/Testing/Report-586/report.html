        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing MFA for email and sensitive data systems, and conducting annual security awareness training for all employees. However, the assessment identified critical gaps in endpoint security, employee policy, and initial employee training. Specifically, the absence of MFA for computer logins, a formal acceptable use policy, and dedicated security awareness training for new hires present significant areas of concern that could expose the organization to various cyber threats.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers/endpoints</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy. Without an AUP, employees may not be fully aware of their responsibilities regarding the use of company IT resources, data handling, and internet usage, leading to potential misuse, data breaches, or compliance violations. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. This leaves new hires vulnerable to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) and unaware of critical security protocols from the start of their employment, potentially exposing the organization to risks before they receive annual training. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised. Develop and enforce a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) to clearly define acceptable behavior and responsibilities regarding IT resource usage, data handling, and internet access. Furthermore, establish mandatory security awareness training for all new employees as part of their onboarding process to ensure they are equipped with essential security knowledge from day one, complementing the existing annual training program.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has some security controls in place, such as MFA for critical systems and annual security training, its overall readiness is hampered by key vulnerabilities. The lack of MFA for computer logins, the absence of an acceptable use policy, and the omission of security training for new employees create exploitable weaknesses. Addressing these areas is crucial for mitigating the risk of unauthorized access, human error, and policy non-compliance, thereby strengthening the organization's defense against evolving cyber threats.</p>
