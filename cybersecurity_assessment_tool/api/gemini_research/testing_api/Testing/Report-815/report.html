        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open SSH port (22), indicating a potential entry point that requires secure configuration. Internal security policies show significant gaps, particularly the lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, which are critical for preventing unauthorized access. Furthermore, the absence of an employee acceptable use policy and annual security awareness training for all employees suggests a need for improved foundational security practices and user education. While MFA is used for sensitive data systems, the broader lack of MFA and policy enforcement across other critical access points poses a substantial risk.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The system's localhost interface is exposed, potentially allowing unauthorized access to services running locally. This vulnerability was identified through a network scan showing an open port 22 (SSH) without specific IP context, suggesting that internal services might be accessible from unintended network segments or that default configurations are in place. An exposed localhost can lead to privilege escalation or unauthorized data access if an attacker gains a foothold on the network.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email and Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email or logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access through compromised credentials. Without MFA, a simple username and password breach can grant an attacker full access to an employee's email and workstation, leading to data exfiltration, further network penetration, or business email compromise. This was identified through the organizational security policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email Systems</li><li>Employee Workstations</li><li>User Accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy and Annual Security Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This creates a significant human factor risk, as employees may unknowingly engage in insecure practices, fall victim to social engineering attacks, or misuse company resources without clear guidelines. The absence of regular training means employees are not kept up-to-date on evolving threats and best practices, increasing the likelihood of security incidents. This was identified through the organizational security policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All Employees</li><li>Organizational Policies</li><li>Information Systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>It is critically important to address the identified vulnerabilities to enhance the organization's security posture. Firstly, the exposed localhost and open SSH port (22) must be secured immediately. This involves reviewing SSH configurations to ensure strong authentication methods, disabling root login, using key-based authentication, and restricting access to trusted IP addresses only. Secondly, the organization must implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and computer logins to significantly reduce the risk of credential compromise. Thirdly, a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy should be developed, communicated, and enforced to establish clear guidelines for secure behavior. Finally, regular, mandatory security awareness training for all employees, conducted at least annually, is essential to educate staff on current threats and best practices, thereby strengthening the human firewall.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The current cybersecurity assessment reveals several critical and high-severity risks stemming from both network configurations and organizational policy gaps. While some security measures are in place (MFA for sensitive data, new employee training), the lack of widespread MFA, an acceptable use policy, and annual security training, combined with an exposed SSH port, indicates a significant level of vulnerability. Addressing these issues proactively is crucial to protect against unauthorized access, data breaches, and other cyber threats, thereby improving the organization's overall security readiness.</p>
