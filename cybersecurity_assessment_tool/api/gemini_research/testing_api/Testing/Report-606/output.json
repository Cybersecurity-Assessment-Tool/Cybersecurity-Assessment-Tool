            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization demonstrates a foundational level of security readiness with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) implemented for email and sensitive data systems, and security awareness training provided to new employees. Network scans indicate that port 80 is currently closed. However, significant gaps exist, including the absence of MFA for computer logins, a lack of a formal employee acceptable use policy, and the omission of annual security awareness training for all employees.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Unencrypted Web Server",
                        "Overview": "A potential risk of an unencrypted web server was identified, typically associated with port 80 being open and serving unencrypted content, which would expose data in transit to eavesdropping. While recent network scans indicate that port 80 is currently closed, mitigating this specific instance of the risk, it remains a critical area for continuous monitoring to ensure any future web services are properly secured with HTTPS/SSL/TLS.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Port 80"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins, thereby significantly strengthening access controls. A comprehensive employee acceptable use policy should be developed and enforced to clearly define acceptable conduct and security responsibilities. Furthermore, mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees is crucial to ensure ongoing education on evolving cyber threats and best practices. Continuous network monitoring should be maintained to ensure that services like unencrypted web servers (port 80) remain closed or are properly secured with encryption (HTTPS/SSL/TLS) if they become active.",
            "Conclusion": "In conclusion, the organization exhibits a mixed state of cybersecurity readiness. While some critical controls like MFA for email and sensitive data are in place, and new employees receive security training, there are notable vulnerabilities concerning computer login MFA, the absence of an acceptable use policy, and a lack of recurring annual security awareness training for the entire workforce. The identified risk of an unencrypted web server is currently mitigated by port 80 being closed, but vigilance is essential. Addressing these gaps through the recommended actions will significantly improve the organization's overall security posture and resilience against cyber threats."
