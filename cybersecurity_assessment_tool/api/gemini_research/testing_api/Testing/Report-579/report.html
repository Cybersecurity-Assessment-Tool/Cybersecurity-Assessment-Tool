        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes a MySQL database on port 3306, indicating a potential vulnerability to external access. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required for computer logins, it is notably absent for email access and sensitive data systems, creating significant security gaps. The organization has an acceptable use policy in place and conducts annual security awareness training for all employees. However, there is no specific security awareness training for new employees, which could lead to early-stage vulnerabilities.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network. This exposes the database to potential unauthorized access and exploitation, which could lead to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service. This was identified via an Nmap scan showing port 3306 as open, indicating that the MySQL service (version 5.7.33) is directly accessible.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted internal IP addresses or specific application servers. For a long-term solution, consider placing the database behind a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or implementing a more robust network segmentation strategy. Furthermore, critical security enhancements include mandating Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised. It is also crucial to establish a comprehensive security awareness training program for all new employees to ensure they are equipped with essential cybersecurity knowledge from day one.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a mixed security posture. While some foundational elements like an acceptable use policy and annual security training are present, critical vulnerabilities exist with an exposed MySQL database and significant gaps in MFA implementation for email and sensitive data systems. The absence of security awareness training for new employees also presents an initial risk. Addressing these vulnerabilities and implementing the recommended security controls is paramount to enhancing the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and protecting its assets from potential threats.</p>
