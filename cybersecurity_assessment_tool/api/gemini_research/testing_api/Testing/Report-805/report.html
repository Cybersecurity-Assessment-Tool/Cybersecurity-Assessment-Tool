        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to cybersecurity best practices by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems, maintaining an employee acceptable use policy, and conducting regular security awareness training for all employees. However, a network scan revealed an outdated Nginx web server, and a review of organizational data indicated a lack of MFA for computer logins, presenting significant attack vectors.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Web Server Software - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nginx web server running on port 443 is identified as version 1.18.0. This version is outdated and known to contain several security vulnerabilities, including potential buffer overflows and memory leaks (e.g., CVE-2021-23017, CVE-2021-23019). Exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to denial of service, information disclosure, or potentially remote code execution, compromising the web server and any hosted applications. This was identified via network scanning.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Nginx 1.18.0 on port 443</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not currently require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly elevates the risk of unauthorized access to internal systems. If an employee's primary credentials (username and password) are compromised through phishing, malware, or other means, an attacker could gain direct access to their workstation and potentially the internal network without an additional layer of security. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee computer login processes</li><li>Internal network access</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>It is strongly recommended to immediately update the Nginx web server to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities and improve overall security. Additionally, implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins is crucial to enhance protection against credential theft and unauthorized access. The organization should continue its excellent practices regarding MFA for email and sensitive data, acceptable use policies, and regular security awareness training, as these are foundational elements of a robust security posture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has established a commendable baseline with strong security awareness training, acceptable use policies, and MFA for critical systems like email and sensitive data, two high-severity vulnerabilities were identified. The outdated Nginx web server and the absence of MFA for computer logins represent significant risks that could be exploited by attackers. Addressing these specific vulnerabilities is paramount to improving the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and reducing its attack surface.</p>
