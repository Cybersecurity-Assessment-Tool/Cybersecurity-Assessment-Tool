        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization currently lacks critical multi-factor authentication (MFA) controls across key access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. While an employee acceptable use policy is in place and new employees receive security awareness training, there is no annual security awareness training for all employees. No specific network-based vulnerabilities were identified through the provided scan data.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for accessing email, logging into computers, or accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access and account compromise should employee credentials be stolen or phished. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to critical organizational resources, leading to data breaches, system compromise, and financial loss. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email systems</li><li>Employee workstations/laptops</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Ongoing Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This oversight can lead to a gradual decline in employee vigilance regarding cybersecurity threats, making them more susceptible to social engineering attacks, phishing attempts, and other human-factor vulnerabilities over time. A lack of regular reinforcement means employees may not be aware of evolving threats or updated security policies, increasing the risk of accidental data exposure or successful cyberattacks. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network integrity</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, establish and enforce a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees to ensure continuous education on evolving threats and best practices. Regularly review and update the acceptable use policy to reflect current security standards and organizational requirements.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on critical systems and a lack of ongoing, annual security awareness training for its entire workforce. While foundational policies like an acceptable use policy and initial new hire training are present, these are insufficient to mitigate the high-impact risks associated with credential compromise and human error. Addressing these core vulnerabilities through the recommended implementations is crucial for improving the organization's overall security readiness and resilience against modern cyber threats.</p>
