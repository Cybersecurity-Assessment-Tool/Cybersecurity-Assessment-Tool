        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a commendable commitment to security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, robust security awareness training programs are in place for both new hires and all employees annually. However, a significant gap exists in the absence of a formal employee acceptable use policy, which could lead to inconsistencies in employee behavior regarding IT resource usage.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy (AUP). This absence means employees may not have clear, documented guidelines regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, data, and internet access. Without an AUP, there is an increased risk of misuse of company assets, accidental data breaches, exposure to malware through unrestricted browsing or unauthorized software installations, and difficulty in enforcing consistent security standards. This vulnerability was identified through the organization's self-reported data indicating no such policy is in place.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources (computers, network, software)</li><li>Organizational data</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>It is strongly recommended that the organization develop and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy (AUP). This policy should clearly define expectations for the use of company-owned devices, networks, software, and data, including guidelines on internet usage, email etiquette, data handling, and prohibited activities. All employees should be required to read, understand, and formally acknowledge the AUP, ideally as part of their onboarding process and during annual security awareness training. Regular reviews and updates of the AUP are also crucial to ensure it remains relevant with evolving technology and organizational needs.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization has established a strong security foundation with mandatory MFA across critical access points and consistent security awareness training, significantly mitigating risks related to unauthorized access and human error. However, the absence of an employee acceptable use policy represents a notable governance gap that could lead to inconsistent employee behavior and increased exposure to various security threats. Addressing this policy deficiency will further enhance the organization's overall security posture and readiness, ensuring a more secure and compliant operational environment.</p>
