        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security through regular security awareness training for all employees and the implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and access to sensitive data systems. However, critical vulnerabilities were identified, including an open HTTP port (80) on the network, the absence of MFA for email access, and a lack of an employee acceptable use policy. These issues pose significant risks to data integrity, confidentiality, and overall network security.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unsecured Web Service Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An Nmap scan revealed an open port 80, indicating an active HTTP service. Without proper security configurations, such as HTTPS redirection, a Web Application Firewall (WAF), and up-to-date web server software, this service is vulnerable to various web-based attacks including information disclosure, cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, or denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. The impact could range from data breaches to service disruption.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li><li>Web Server</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Email Account Compromise - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of email account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. A compromised email account can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, or further lateral movement within the network, posing a critical threat to the organization's security posture.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy (AUP). Without a clear AUP, employees may be unaware of acceptable and unacceptable use of company IT resources, leading to potential misuse, unauthorized software installations, data exfiltration, or engagement in risky online behaviors. This increases the risk of insider threats, compliance violations, and overall operational security weaknesses.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>IT resources</li><li>Data</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement HTTPS for all web services running on port 80 and ensure proper web server security configurations are in place. Furthermore, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be enforced for all email accounts to significantly reduce the risk of account compromise. Finally, the organization should develop and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy (AUP) to clearly define expectations for IT resource usage and enhance overall security governance.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has established a good foundation with security awareness training and MFA for critical systems, the presence of an open HTTP port, the lack of MFA for email, and the absence of an acceptable use policy represent significant vulnerabilities. Addressing these critical and high-severity risks is paramount to enhancing the organization's cybersecurity readiness and protecting its assets from potential threats.</p>
