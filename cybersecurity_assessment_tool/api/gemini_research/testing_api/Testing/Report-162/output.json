            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network scan indicates a host is active, with port 80 currently closed. However, a broader assessment identified a potential unencrypted web server. Internally, the organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and maintains an employee acceptable use policy, along with annual security awareness training for all employees. Critical security gaps exist, including the lack of MFA for email and sensitive data system access, and the absence of security awareness training for new employees.",

                        "Risk": "Unencrypted Web Server",
                        "Overview": "Port 80 is open, indicating a potential web server operating without encryption. This exposes data transmitted between the server and clients to eavesdropping and interception, compromising confidentiality. This was identified through network scanning.",

                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Email Access",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee inboxes if credentials are compromised, potentially leading to phishing, data exfiltration, or business email compromise. This was identified through organizational policy review.",

                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems",
                        "Overview": "Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not enforced for access to systems containing sensitive data. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if a single set of credentials is stolen or guessed, posing a severe risk of data breaches and compliance violations. This was identified through organizational policy review.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Absence of Security Awareness Training for New Employees",
                        "Overview": "New employees do not receive security awareness training upon joining the organization. This leaves them susceptible to common social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) and unaware of organizational security policies and best practices from the outset, increasing the overall human risk factor. This was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "New employees",

                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access from compromised credentials. Furthermore, establish a comprehensive security awareness training program for all new employees as part of their onboarding process, covering topics such as phishing, password hygiene, and data handling policies. For the identified unencrypted web server, ensure all web services are configured to use HTTPS with valid SSL/TLS certificates to encrypt data in transit. If port 80 is not intended for public access, it should be closed or restricted.",
            "Conclusion": "In conclusion, while the organization demonstrates some security strengths, such as MFA for computer logins and annual security awareness training, significant vulnerabilities remain. The absence of MFA for email and sensitive data systems, coupled with a lack of security awareness training for new employees, presents critical risks that could lead to data breaches and unauthorized access. Addressing these gaps is paramount to enhancing the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and readiness against evolving threats."
