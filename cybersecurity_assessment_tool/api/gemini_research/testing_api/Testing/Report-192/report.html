        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Based on the provided organizational data, a detailed network summary from scan data is unavailable as the 'Network Scan Data' was broken. However, a review of the organization's security policies reveals significant gaps in multi-factor authentication (MFA) implementation and security awareness training. The organization currently does not enforce MFA for email access, computer logins, or sensitive data systems. Furthermore, there is no security awareness training for new employees, nor is there annual training for all employees. While an acceptable use policy is in place, the absence of these fundamental security controls indicates a low level of readiness against common cyber threats.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee inboxes if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. A successful compromise could lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, or further lateral movement within the network. This vulnerability was identified from the 'Org Data'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email accounts</li><li>Email servers</li><li>User credentials</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if user credentials are stolen or guessed. An attacker gaining access to a computer could potentially access internal resources, install malware, or escalate privileges. This vulnerability was identified from the 'Org Data'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Servers</li><li>User accounts</li><li>Network access</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk to the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information. Without MFA, a single compromised password could grant an attacker direct access to critical business data, customer information, or intellectual property, leading to severe data breaches and regulatory non-compliance. This vulnerability was identified from the 'Org Data'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>Cloud storage</li><li>Critical applications</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees and does not provide annual training for all employees. This lack of training leaves employees susceptible to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, vishing, pretexting), malware, and poor security practices. Employees are often the weakest link in an organization's security posture, and without proper education, they are more likely to fall victim to attacks that could compromise the entire network. This vulnerability was identified from the 'Org Data'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li><li>Endpoints</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points. This includes enforcing MFA for email access, computer logins, and especially for all sensitive data systems. Furthermore, a comprehensive security awareness training program must be established. This program should include mandatory training for all new employees upon onboarding and annual refresher training for all existing employees. Training should cover topics such as phishing recognition, password hygiene, social engineering tactics, and data handling best practices. Regular simulated phishing exercises should also be conducted to test employee vigilance and reinforce training.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity vulnerabilities primarily due to the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication across key access points and a complete lack of security awareness training for its workforce. While an acceptable use policy is present, it is insufficient to compensate for these critical gaps. Without immediate action to implement MFA and establish robust security awareness training, the organization remains highly susceptible to various cyberattacks, including credential compromise, unauthorized data access, and social engineering, which could lead to severe data breaches and operational disruptions. The current security posture indicates a low level of readiness against prevalent cyber threats.</p>
