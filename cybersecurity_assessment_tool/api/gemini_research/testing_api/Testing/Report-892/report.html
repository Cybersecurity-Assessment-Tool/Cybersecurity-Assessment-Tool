        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan data provided minimal information, indicating no immediately apparent open ports or active services that would suggest direct network-based vulnerabilities. However, a review of organizational security practices reveals several areas of concern. The organization has implemented MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems and maintains an acceptable use policy, along with annual security awareness training for all employees. Despite these positive measures, critical gaps exist in email security and initial employee training.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts if credentials are stolen or compromised through phishing or other attacks. Email accounts often contain sensitive information and can be used as a pivot point for further attacks within the organization. This vulnerability was identified from the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on email access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li><li>Organizational data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees upon onboarding. This leaves new hires vulnerable to social engineering attacks, phishing, and other common threats from day one, as they may not be aware of the organization's security policies, best practices, or common attack vectors. While annual training is conducted for all employees, the initial period for new employees is a critical gap. This vulnerability was identified from the organizational data indicating 'No' for security awareness training for new employees.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational network</li><li>Data</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access. This crucial step will significantly enhance protection against credential theft and unauthorized access to email accounts. Furthermore, a comprehensive security awareness training program should be established for all new employees as part of their onboarding process. This training should cover common threats, organizational policies, and best practices to ensure new hires are equipped to identify and respond to potential security incidents from their first day. Regular review and updates to security policies and training materials are also advised to adapt to evolving threat landscapes.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the network perimeter appears to be in a reasonable state based on the limited scan data, the organization exhibits critical gaps in its internal security posture, particularly concerning email access and new employee security awareness. The absence of MFA for email access presents a significant attack surface, and the lack of initial security training for new hires introduces unnecessary risk. Addressing these vulnerabilities is paramount to strengthening the overall security readiness and protecting against common and impactful cyber threats.</p>
