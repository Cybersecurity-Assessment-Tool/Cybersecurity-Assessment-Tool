            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and conducts regular security awareness training for all employees. However, critical vulnerabilities were identified, including an exposed Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) service. Furthermore, there are significant gaps in security policies, specifically the lack of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, and the absence of an employee acceptable use policy. These areas represent considerable risks to the organization's network and data integrity.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "RDP Exposure",
                        "Overview": "Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed on the network, specifically on port 3389. This allows external access to internal systems, which can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access, execute malicious code, or move laterally within the network. The presence of an open RDP port was identified through network scanning.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "IP",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Computer Login",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication. This vulnerability was identified through a review of organizational security policies.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems",
                        "Overview": "Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access sensitive data systems. This poses a high risk, as compromised credentials could grant direct access to critical and confidential information, leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and reputational damage. This vulnerability was identified through a review of organizational security policies.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                    {
                        "Risk": "Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy",
                        "Overview": "The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines on appropriate use of company IT resources, employees may inadvertently engage in risky behaviors, such as visiting malicious websites, downloading unauthorized software, or mishandling sensitive data, increasing the overall attack surface and potential for security incidents. This vulnerability was identified through a review of organizational security policies.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "Company IT resources",
                            "Network infrastructure"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately close port 3389 to external access. For any necessary remote access, implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution to secure RDP connections. Furthermore, implement and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and for access to all sensitive data systems. Develop and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy, clearly outlining expectations for IT resource usage, data handling, and security best practices, ensuring all employees are trained on this policy. Regularly review and update security policies and configurations, and conduct periodic vulnerability scans and penetration tests to proactively identify and remediate new risks.",
            "Conclusion": "While the organization has a foundation in security with MFA for email and regular security awareness training, critical vulnerabilities such as exposed RDP and significant gaps in MFA implementation for computer logins and sensitive data systems pose substantial risks. The absence of an acceptable use policy further exacerbates these concerns. Addressing these high-severity issues is crucial to significantly enhance the organization's overall security posture and readiness against evolving cyber threats."
