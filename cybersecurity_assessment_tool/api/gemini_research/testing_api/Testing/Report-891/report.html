        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes a MySQL database (version 5.7.33) on port 3306, indicating a potential vulnerability to unauthorized access. Furthermore, the organization exhibits significant gaps in its security posture regarding user authentication and policy enforcement. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for email access or computer logins, leaving these critical entry points susceptible to credential-based attacks. While MFA is used for sensitive data systems, its absence elsewhere creates a substantial risk. The lack of an employee acceptable use policy means there are no formal guidelines for secure behavior, and although new employees receive security awareness training, there is no annual training for all employees, which can lead to outdated knowledge and increased susceptibility to evolving threats.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network. This exposes the database to potential unauthorized access, data breaches, and denial-of-service attacks if not properly secured. The vulnerability was identified through a network port scan showing port 3306 as open, running MySQL version 5.7.33.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li><li>MySQL Database Server</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for email access. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing or brute-force attacks, as a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to an employee's email, potentially leading to further internal network access or data exfiltration. This was identified from the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on email.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email accounts</li><li>Employee credentials</li><li>Email server</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for computer logins. This makes endpoints more vulnerable to unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or guessed, potentially leading to lateral movement within the network, malware deployment, or data theft from individual workstations. This was identified from the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on computer logins.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network access points</li><li>Employee credentials</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines, employees may engage in risky online behaviors, use company resources inappropriately, or inadvertently introduce malware, increasing the overall attack surface and legal liabilities. This was identified from the organizational data indicating 'No' for an acceptable use policy.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Recurring Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. While new employees receive training, the lack of regular refreshers means employees may forget best practices, become complacent, or not be updated on new threats, making them more susceptible to social engineering attacks like phishing and ransomware. This was identified from the organizational data indicating 'No' for annual training.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li><li>Phishing susceptibility</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted internal IP addresses or specific application servers. For long-term security, consider placing the database behind a VPN or using a secure tunnel, and ensure strong authentication and authorization mechanisms are in place for database access. Furthermore, the organization must implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and computer logins across the organization to significantly enhance credential security. A comprehensive employee acceptable use policy should be developed, communicated, and enforced, ensuring all employees acknowledge and understand their responsibilities. Finally, establish a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees, covering current threats like phishing, social engineering, and data handling best practices to maintain a vigilant and informed workforce.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several critical and high-severity cybersecurity risks, primarily stemming from an exposed database service, a lack of comprehensive Multi-Factor Authentication implementation, and significant gaps in security policies and ongoing employee training. While MFA is utilized for sensitive data systems, its absence for email and computer logins, coupled with an open database port, creates easily exploitable entry points for attackers. The lack of an acceptable use policy and annual security awareness training further weakens the human element of security. Addressing these vulnerabilities promptly is crucial to prevent potential data breaches, unauthorized access, and other cyber incidents, thereby significantly improving the organization's overall security posture and readiness against evolving threats.</p>
