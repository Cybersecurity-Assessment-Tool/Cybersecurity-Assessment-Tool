        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to multi-factor authentication (MFA) across critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. However, a comprehensive assessment of the network's technical posture is currently unavailable due to broken network scan data. Policy-wise, there are notable gaps in employee acceptable use policies and recurring security awareness training.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. This absence creates a significant risk as employees may not be fully aware of their responsibilities regarding company assets, data handling, and internet usage. Without clear guidelines, there's an increased potential for misuse of company resources, data breaches, and non-compliance with regulatory requirements. This was identified directly from the provided organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company assets</li><li>Data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Recurring Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual training for all employees. This poses a risk as cybersecurity threats constantly evolve, and employee knowledge can degrade over time. A lack of regular updates means employees may not be aware of the latest phishing techniques, social engineering tactics, or internal security protocols, increasing the likelihood of human-error-induced security incidents. This was identified directly from the provided organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement a formal employee acceptable use policy that clearly outlines expectations for responsible use of company resources and data. Furthermore, establishing a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees is crucial to ensure ongoing education on evolving threats and best practices. Additionally, a complete and successful network scan is essential to identify and address any technical vulnerabilities within the infrastructure.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization exhibits a commendable stance on MFA implementation, securing access to key systems. However, significant policy and training gaps, specifically the absence of an acceptable use policy and annual security awareness training, introduce considerable human-factor risks. The overall technical readiness remains undetermined due to the unavailability of network scan data. Addressing these policy deficiencies and conducting a thorough technical assessment are critical next steps to achieve a robust cybersecurity posture.</p>
