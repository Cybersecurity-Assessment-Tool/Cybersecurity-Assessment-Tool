        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network environment, based on the provided data, indicates a significant reliance on single-factor authentication across critical access points including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. While an acceptable use policy is in place and annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees, there is a notable gap in providing security awareness training for new employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. A successful compromise could lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, or further network penetration. This was identified directly from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email systems</li><li>Employee accounts</li><li>Sensitive communications</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if user credentials are stolen or guessed. An attacker gaining access to a computer could potentially move laterally within the network, access local sensitive data, or deploy malware. This was identified directly from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Servers (if applicable for login)</li><li>Network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk to the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information. If an attacker compromises credentials for these systems, they can gain direct access to highly confidential data without an additional layer of security. This was identified directly from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data repositories</li><li>Databases</li><li>Critical business applications</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. This leaves new hires vulnerable to social engineering attacks, phishing attempts, and other common threats due to a lack of immediate education on organizational security policies and best practices. New employees are often targeted as they may be less familiar with internal procedures and red flags. While annual training is provided, the initial onboarding period is a critical window for establishing secure habits. This was identified directly from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li><li>Susceptibility to social engineering</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points. This includes enforcing MFA for email access, computer logins, and especially for all sensitive data systems. Furthermore, a comprehensive security awareness training program should be immediately integrated into the onboarding process for all new employees to ensure they are equipped with essential cybersecurity knowledge from day one. Regular, engaging training for all employees should continue annually, reinforcing best practices and addressing emerging threats. Review and update the acceptable use policy regularly to reflect current threats and technologies.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to the widespread absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. This leaves critical assets highly vulnerable to credential-based attacks. While an acceptable use policy is in place and annual security awareness training is conducted, the lack of initial security training for new employees represents a notable gap in readiness. Addressing these MFA deficiencies and bolstering initial employee training are crucial steps to improve the organization's overall security posture and reduce its attack surface.</p>
