        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to multi-factor authentication (MFA) across critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. This significantly enhances protection against unauthorized access via compromised credentials. Furthermore, the external network scan revealed no open ports, indicating a well-secured perimeter from a basic port-scanning perspective. Despite these technical strengths, significant gaps exist in foundational security policies and employee training. The complete absence of an employee acceptable use policy and any form of security awareness training (for new or existing employees) introduces substantial human-factor risks that could undermine existing technical controls.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without a clear policy, employees may not understand the proper and improper use of company IT resources, leading to potential misuse, data breaches, or compliance violations. This increases the risk of unintentional or malicious actions by employees that could compromise security. This vulnerability was identified directly from the organization's self-reported data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Data integrity and confidentiality</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often targets for social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) as they may not be familiar with company security protocols, common threat vectors, or how to identify suspicious activities. This lack of initial training leaves them vulnerable and significantly increases the risk of successful attacks that leverage human error. This vulnerability was identified directly from the organization's self-reported data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Company data</li><li>Network access</li><li>Organizational reputation</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Annual Security Awareness Training for All Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. Without regular training, employees' knowledge of current threats, evolving attack techniques, and best security practices can degrade over time. This makes them more susceptible to sophisticated social engineering tactics and other human-centric attacks, diminishing the effectiveness of technical security controls. This vulnerability was identified directly from the organization's self-reported data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company data</li><li>Network access</li><li>Overall security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To address the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy. This policy should clearly define expectations for IT resource usage, data handling, and security responsibilities. Furthermore, a mandatory and recurring security awareness training program must be established. This program should include initial training for all new employees upon onboarding and annual refresher training for all existing staff. Training content should cover critical topics such as identifying and reporting phishing and social engineering attempts, secure data handling practices, password hygiene, and incident reporting procedures. Empowering employees through education will transform them into a strong line of defense, complementing the existing technical controls like MFA.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has implemented robust multi-factor authentication across key systems and maintains a seemingly secure external network perimeter, its overall cybersecurity readiness is significantly hampered by a critical lack of human-centric security controls. The absence of an acceptable use policy and any security awareness training leaves the organization highly vulnerable to social engineering attacks and internal policy violations. Addressing these foundational gaps is paramount to building a truly resilient security posture and mitigating the most common attack vectors that often bypass technical defenses.</p>
