        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan identified an open MySQL database port (3306) running version 5.7.33. This indicates a potential exposure of database services. From an organizational policy standpoint, the company has implemented an acceptable use policy and conducts security awareness training for both new and existing employees annually. However, a significant gap exists in the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for critical access points including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network, exposing the database service (MySQL version 5.7.33). This allows external entities to potentially interact with the database, increasing the risk of unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or denial of service if vulnerabilities in the MySQL service are exploited or weak credentials are used. The vulnerability was identified through network scanning.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email, logging into computers, or accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or other means, as a single factor (password) is the only barrier to entry. This absence of a critical security control was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email access</li><li>Computer login</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted internal IP addresses or specific application servers. For long-term security, consider placing the database behind a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or within a segmented network zone. Crucially, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) should be deployed across all critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, to significantly enhance account security and prevent unauthorized access even if passwords are compromised. Regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing should also be conducted to identify and address new exposures.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security through its acceptable use policy and regular security awareness training. However, critical vulnerabilities exist with an exposed MySQL database port and, more significantly, the complete absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for key access points. Addressing these high-severity risks by implementing robust network segmentation, firewall rules, and MFA across the enterprise is paramount to improving the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and readiness against modern threats.</p>
