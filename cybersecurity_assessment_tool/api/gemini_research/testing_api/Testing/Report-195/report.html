        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently has an open MySQL port (3306) running version 5.7.33, which is a significant exposure point. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for email and computer logins, it is notably absent for sensitive data systems. The organization has an acceptable use policy and conducts annual security awareness training for all employees, but there is a gap in providing security awareness training for new employees during their onboarding process.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network. This exposes the database to potential unauthorized access, data breaches, and denial-of-service attacks if not properly secured. This was identified via network port scanning.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Access Control for Sensitive Data - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if credentials are compromised, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Onboarding Security Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. This leaves new hires vulnerable to social engineering attacks, phishing, and other common threats during their initial employment period, potentially introducing vulnerabilities before they receive annual training. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted internal sources or via a secure VPN. Furthermore, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be enforced for all sensitive data systems to significantly enhance access control and protect critical information. A mandatory security awareness training program should be established for all new employees as part of their onboarding process to ensure they are equipped with essential cybersecurity knowledge from day one. The organization should continue its annual security awareness training for all employees and regularly review and update its acceptable use policy.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security with MFA for email and computer logins, an acceptable use policy, and annual security awareness training. However, critical vulnerabilities exist, including an exposed MySQL database, the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems, and a lack of initial security training for new hires. Addressing these specific gaps is crucial for significantly improving the overall security posture and reducing the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access.</p>
