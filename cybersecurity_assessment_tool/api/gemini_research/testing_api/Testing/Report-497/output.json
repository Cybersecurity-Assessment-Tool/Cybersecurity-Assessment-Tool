            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network scan revealed an open RDP port (3389), indicating potential external exposure. Internally, while Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is utilized for computer logins and sensitive data systems, it is notably absent for email access. Furthermore, the organization lacks security awareness training for both new and existing employees, despite having an acceptable use policy in place.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "RDP Exposure",
                        "Overview": "Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed externally on port 3389. This allows potential attackers to attempt brute-force attacks or exploit vulnerabilities in the RDP service to gain unauthorized access to internal systems. The impact could range from unauthorized access to full system compromise. This vulnerability was identified via network port scanning.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "IP address with open port 3389"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Email Access",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks. If an attacker gains access to an employee's email, it can be used for further internal phishing, data exfiltration, or business email compromise (BEC) scams. This was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Email system",
                            "All employee email accounts"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Insufficient Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or annual refresher training for all employees. This leaves employees vulnerable to social engineering attacks, phishing, malware, and other common threats, as they may not recognize or report suspicious activities. A lack of consistent training increases the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents. This was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "Organizational security posture"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is critical to immediately close port 3389 to external access. For legitimate remote access needs, implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution that requires strong authentication, ideally with MFA, before allowing RDP connections. Furthermore, implement and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts to add a critical layer of security against credential compromise. Establish a comprehensive security awareness training program, including mandatory training for all new hires and annual refresher training for all employees, covering topics such as phishing, social engineering, password hygiene, and incident reporting. Regularly review and update security policies and configurations, and conduct periodic vulnerability scans and penetration tests to proactively identify and address new risks.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces significant security risks, primarily stemming from an externally exposed RDP service and critical gaps in its internal security posture, specifically the lack of MFA for email and comprehensive security awareness training. While MFA is utilized for computer logins and sensitive data systems, these other vulnerabilities present clear pathways for potential attackers. Addressing these identified risks, particularly the RDP exposure and the implementation of MFA for email, is paramount to enhancing the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and reducing its attack surface. A proactive approach to employee training will further strengthen the human element of defense."
