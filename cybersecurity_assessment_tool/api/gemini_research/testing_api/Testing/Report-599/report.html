        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization exhibits a mixed security posture with some foundational controls in place, such as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. However, significant gaps exist in critical areas. Network scans identified an open SSH port (22), which, depending on its exposure and configuration, could pose a risk. More critically, the organization lacks MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, leaving these crucial access points vulnerable. Furthermore, there is an absence of an employee acceptable use policy and no regular security awareness training for new or existing employees, which significantly increases the human element risk and potential for internal misuse or external social engineering attacks. A critical vulnerability related to an 'Localhost Exposed' was also identified, indicating a severe misconfiguration or exposure.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A critical vulnerability was identified where an internal IP address appears to be exposed, potentially to an external network. This could allow unauthorized access to internal services or information, leading to data breaches or system compromise. The exact nature of the exposed service on the IP needs further investigation, but a CVSS score of 10.0 indicates maximum severity and immediate attention is required.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee workstations and the internal network if credentials are compromised through phishing, malware, or brute-force attacks. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to an endpoint.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee Workstations</li><li>Internal Network Access Points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Critical systems containing sensitive data are not protected by MFA. This poses an extreme risk, as a compromised single-factor credential could directly lead to a major data breach, regulatory non-compliance, and severe reputational and financial damage. Direct access to sensitive data systems without strong authentication is a critical security flaw.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive Data Systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>Critical Applications</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an acceptable use policy for employees. This absence creates ambiguity regarding appropriate use of company resources, internet access, and data handling, increasing the risk of misuse, data leakage, and legal liabilities. It also hinders incident response efforts as there are no clear guidelines to enforce.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All Employees</li><li>Company Resources</li><li>Data Handling Procedures</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or annual refreshers for all staff. This leaves employees vulnerable to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting), malware, and other human-centric threats. A lack of awareness is a primary vector for successful cyberattacks and significantly weakens the organization's overall security posture.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All Employees</li><li>Email Systems</li><li>Internal Network</li><li>Data Security</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port (Port 22) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An Nmap scan identified an open SSH port (22) on a host within the network. While SSH is a legitimate service, an open port, especially if exposed externally or poorly configured (e.g., weak passwords, outdated software), can be a target for brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or exploitation of SSH vulnerabilities, potentially leading to unauthorized remote access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with Port 22 Open</li><li>SSH Service</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately investigate and secure the 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability, ensuring no internal services are inadvertently accessible from external networks. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and, critically, for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to establish clear guidelines for resource usage and data handling. Furthermore, establish a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees and conduct annual refreshers for all staff to educate them on common cyber threats and best practices. Finally, review the configuration and exposure of the open SSH port (22) identified in the network scan, ensuring it is properly secured, patched, and only accessible from trusted sources.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several critical and high-severity vulnerabilities that significantly impact its cybersecurity readiness. The lack of MFA for key access points, absence of essential security policies, and insufficient employee training create substantial attack vectors. While MFA for email is a positive step, these other gaps leave the organization highly susceptible to data breaches, unauthorized access, and operational disruption. Immediate action on the provided recommendations is crucial to enhance the overall security posture and protect against prevalent cyber threats.</p>
