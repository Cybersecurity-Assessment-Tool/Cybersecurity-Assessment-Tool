            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network currently exposes a single service, Nginx version 1.18.0, on port 443 (HTTPS). This indicates a web server is publicly accessible. While MFA is implemented for email and computer logins, it is notably absent for sensitive data systems. Furthermore, annual security awareness training for all employees is not consistently performed.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Outdated Web Server Software",
                        "Overview": "The Nginx web server running on port 443 is version 1.18.0. This version is older and may contain known security vulnerabilities that have been addressed in more recent releases. Running outdated software increases the attack surface and the likelihood of exploitation by malicious actors. This was identified through an Nmap scan.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Nginx 1.18.0 (port 443)"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems",
                        "Overview": "Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly elevates the risk of unauthorized access should an employee's credentials be compromised through phishing, keylogging, or other credential theft methods. Without MFA, a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to critical organizational data. This was identified through a review of organizational access policies.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Sensitive data systems"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. This gap in recurring training increases the risk of employees falling victim to evolving social engineering attacks (e.g., advanced phishing campaigns), mishandling sensitive information, or failing to adhere to current security best practices, thereby weakening the overall human firewall. This was identified through a review of organizational training policies.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "Organizational security posture"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately update the Nginx web server to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities and improve security. Furthermore, implementing mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems is critical to prevent unauthorized access even if primary credentials are compromised. Finally, a comprehensive and mandatory annual security awareness training program should be established for all employees to ensure they are equipped to recognize and respond to current cyber threats, reinforcing the organization's human defense layer.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization demonstrates a foundational level of security readiness with MFA for email and computer logins, and initial security awareness training for new hires. However, significant vulnerabilities exist due to outdated public-facing software, the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems, and a lack of consistent annual security awareness training for all employees. Addressing these areas is crucial to enhance the overall security posture and reduce the risk of successful cyberattacks."
