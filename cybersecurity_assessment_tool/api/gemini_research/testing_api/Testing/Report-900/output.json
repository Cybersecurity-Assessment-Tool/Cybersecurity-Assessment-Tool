            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network security posture indicates several areas requiring immediate attention. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for email access, it is notably absent for computer logins and sensitive data systems, creating significant authentication vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the lack of an acceptable use policy for employees and the absence of annual security awareness training for all staff suggest a gap in foundational security policies and ongoing human-factor risk mitigation.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Computer Login",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for employees to log into their computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or malware. Without a second factor, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's workstation and potentially the internal network. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'Do you require MFA to log into computers?':'No'.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems",
                        "Overview": "Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not mandated for accessing sensitive data systems. This critical oversight leaves sensitive information vulnerable to unauthorized access. If an attacker gains access to a user's credentials, they can directly access and potentially exfiltrate or tamper with sensitive data without an additional layer of security. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'Do you require MFA to access sensitive data systems?':'No'.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy",
                        "Overview": "The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. This absence means there are no clear guidelines for employees regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, internet, email, and data. This can lead to misuse of company assets, increased exposure to malware, data leakage, and non-compliance with regulatory requirements. Without a policy, employees may unknowingly engage in risky behaviors. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'Does your organization have an employee acceptable use policy?':'No'.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This creates a significant human-factor vulnerability as security threats evolve rapidly. Employees who do not receive regular updates on current threats (e.g., new phishing techniques, social engineering tactics) are more susceptible to falling victim to attacks, potentially compromising the organization's security. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'Does your organization do security awareness training for all employees at least once per year?':'No'.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "Organizational resilience against social engineering and phishing attacks"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, the organization should immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and sensitive data systems. This is a critical step to enhance authentication security and prevent unauthorized access. Concurrently, a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy must be developed, communicated, and enforced to establish clear guidelines for IT resource usage. Furthermore, the organization should establish a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees to ensure they are continuously updated on evolving cyber threats and best practices, thereby strengthening the human firewall. Regular policy reviews and updates are also recommended to adapt to the changing threat landscape.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces significant vulnerabilities primarily stemming from inadequate authentication controls for computer logins and sensitive data systems, as well as a lack of fundamental security policies and ongoing employee training. While email access benefits from MFA, the broader security posture is compromised by these gaps. Addressing these critical areas through the recommended implementations of MFA, an acceptable use policy, and annual security awareness training is essential to improve the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and reduce its exposure to potential breaches and data loss."
