        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an active host with an open SSH port (22), indicating a potential entry point. A critical vulnerability related to localhost exposure was also identified. Furthermore, a review of organizational data indicates significant gaps in foundational security practices. Specifically, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for email access, computer logins, or sensitive data systems, leaving critical assets vulnerable to credential compromise. The absence of an employee acceptable use policy and a complete lack of security awareness training for both new and existing employees further exacerbates the human risk factor, creating a permissive environment for potential security incidents.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A critical vulnerability where the localhost is directly exposed, potentially allowing unauthorized access to internal services or data. This was identified through network scanning, indicating a misconfiguration or lack of proper network segmentation.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li><li>Network Interface</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH port (22) was detected on an active host. While SSH is a legitimate service, an open port without proper security controls (e.g., strong authentication, IP restrictions, regular patching) can be exploited by attackers for brute-force attacks, unauthorized access, or as a pivot point into the network. This was identified via network scanning.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host IP</li><li>Port 22</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to email accounts if credentials are compromised through phishing or other means, potentially leading to business email compromise, data exfiltration, or further internal network access. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if user credentials are stolen or guessed, potentially leading to lateral movement within the network, installation of malware, and access to sensitive data. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations</li><li>Servers</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk, as compromised credentials could grant direct access to highly confidential information, leading to severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and significant reputational damage. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>File shares</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without a clear AUP, employees may unknowingly engage in activities that pose security risks (e.g., installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, improper data handling), increasing the likelihood of malware infections, data loss, or policy violations. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Organizational policies</li><li>Employee behavior</li></ul>

            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training. This leaves new hires vulnerable to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) and unaware of organizational security best practices from the start, making them potential entry points for attackers. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Human resources onboarding process</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Annual Security Awareness Training for All Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. Regular training is crucial to keep employees updated on evolving threats and reinforce secure behaviors. The absence of such training leads to a decay in security knowledge and an increased susceptibility to various cyber threats over time. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational culture</li><li>Training programs</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, immediate action is required. First, address the 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability by ensuring proper network segmentation and access controls are in place to prevent unauthorized access to internal services. For the open SSH port, ensure strong authentication mechanisms are enforced, consider restricting access to trusted IPs, and regularly patch the SSH server. Critically, implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all access points: email systems, computer logins, and especially for sensitive data systems, to significantly reduce the impact of compromised credentials. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to guide appropriate digital conduct. Furthermore, establish and implement mandatory security awareness training programs for all new employees during onboarding and conduct annual refresher training for all staff to foster a strong security culture and educate against evolving threats like phishing and social engineering. Regularly review and update security policies and configurations to maintain a robust security posture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces a significant array of cybersecurity vulnerabilities, ranging from critical technical exposures like 'Localhost Exposed' and an open SSH port, to fundamental weaknesses in its security policies and human element controls. The complete absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for key access points (email, computer login, sensitive data) represents a critical risk, making the organization highly susceptible to credential-based attacks and unauthorized data access. The lack of an acceptable use policy and comprehensive security awareness training further compounds these risks by leaving employees unprepared for common threats and without clear guidelines for secure behavior. While specific network details were limited, the identified issues indicate a low level of cybersecurity readiness. Addressing these vulnerabilities through technical controls and robust policy implementation, particularly the immediate deployment of MFA and comprehensive security training, is paramount to improving the organization's overall security posture and reducing its attack surface.</p>
