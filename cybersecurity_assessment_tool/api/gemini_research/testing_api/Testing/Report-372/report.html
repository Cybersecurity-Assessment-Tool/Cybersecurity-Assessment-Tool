        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network assessment, based on provided organizational data, indicates a significant lack of foundational security controls. Specifically, there is no multi-factor authentication (MFA) required for accessing email, logging into computers, or accessing sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees, despite providing initial training for new hires. These gaps suggest a high potential for unauthorized access and internal security incidents.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access significantly increases the risk of account compromise. If an attacker obtains a user's password through phishing or other means, they can gain full access to the employee's email, potentially leading to further internal network penetration, data exfiltration, or business email compromise (BEC) attacks. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating "Do you require MFA to access email?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>All employee email accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Not requiring Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins makes workstations highly susceptible to unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or guessed. This could allow an attacker to access internal systems, install malware, or move laterally within the network from a compromised endpoint. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating "Do you require MFA to log into computers?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for sensitive data systems represents a critical security gap. Should an attacker compromise credentials for these systems, they would have direct, unimpeded access to highly confidential or critical organizational data, leading to severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and significant reputational damage. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating "Do you require MFA to access sensitive data systems?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>Critical business applications</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The lack of an employee acceptable use policy (AUP) creates ambiguity regarding the proper use of company IT resources. Without clear guidelines, employees may inadvertently engage in risky behaviors, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive data, increasing the organization's exposure to cyber threats and legal liabilities. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating "Does your organization have an employee acceptable use policy?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the absence of annual training for all employees leaves the organization vulnerable to evolving threats. Without regular updates and reinforcement, employees may forget best practices, become complacent, or fail to recognize new social engineering tactics, increasing the likelihood of successful phishing attacks, malware infections, and insider threats. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating "Does your organization do security awareness training for all employees at least once per year?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, including email systems, computer logins, and especially sensitive data systems, to prevent unauthorized access even if passwords are compromised. Furthermore, the organization should develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to clearly define expectations for IT resource usage and mitigate internal risks. Finally, a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees must be established to ensure continuous education on current cyber threats and best practices, reinforcing a strong security culture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The current assessment reveals critical vulnerabilities primarily stemming from a lack of fundamental security controls, particularly the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for key access points and the lack of comprehensive security policies and ongoing training. While new employee training is in place, the overall readiness is low due to these significant gaps. Addressing these issues with the recommended implementations is crucial to protect against common cyber threats, prevent data breaches, and establish a more robust and resilient security environment.</p>
