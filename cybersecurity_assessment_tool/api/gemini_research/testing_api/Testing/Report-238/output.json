            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems, and conducts regular security awareness training for all employees. However, there are gaps in security posture related to computer login MFA and the absence of an employee acceptable use policy. No technical vulnerabilities were identified through network scanning.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Computer Login",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to internal systems if credentials are compromised through phishing, malware, or brute-force attacks. Without a second factor, a stolen password is often sufficient for an attacker to gain access, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or lateral movement within the network. This was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employee computers",
                            "Internal network access points"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy",
                        "Overview": "The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This means there are no formal guidelines or rules defining the appropriate use of company IT resources, data, and internet access. Without such a policy, employees may inadvertently or intentionally engage in activities that pose security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, sharing sensitive information inappropriately, or using company devices for personal, high-risk activities. This absence can lead to increased exposure to malware, data leakage, and compliance issues. This was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "Company IT resources",
                            "Data handling procedures"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, the organization should immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins across the enterprise. This will significantly enhance protection against credential theft and unauthorized access. Additionally, a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy must be developed, communicated, and enforced. This policy should clearly outline expectations for the use of company assets, data handling, internet usage, and software installation, ensuring all employees understand their responsibilities in maintaining a secure environment. Regular reviews and updates of this policy are also recommended.",
            "Conclusion": "While the organization demonstrates good practices in implementing MFA for email and sensitive data systems, and maintains consistent security awareness training, critical vulnerabilities exist. The absence of MFA for computer logins and a formal employee acceptable use policy exposes the organization to significant risks of unauthorized access and potential misuse of IT resources. Addressing these gaps is crucial for strengthening the overall security posture and reducing the likelihood of successful cyberattacks and internal security incidents."
