        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network includes an FTP server running vsftpd version 2.3.4, which was found to allow anonymous login. Internally, the organization has a mixed security posture regarding authentication; Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required for computer logins, but not for accessing email or sensitive data systems. On the positive side, the organization has an employee acceptable use policy in place and conducts security awareness training for all new employees, as well as annually for all existing employees. However, a significant number of workstations are still running Windows 7, an operating system that has reached its end-of-life.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Anonymous FTP Login Allowed - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The FTP server, identified as vsftpd 2.3.4 and accessible on port 21, is configured to allow anonymous login. This configuration poses a significant risk as it enables unauthorized access to the server's file system, potentially leading to data leakage, unauthorized file uploads, or even server compromise if write permissions are misconfigured. This vulnerability was identified through an Nmap scan utilizing the 'ftp-anon' script.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>FTP Server (vsftpd 2.3.4)</li><li>Port 21</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not currently require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through common attack vectors such as phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks. A compromised email account can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and further lateral movement within the network. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email System</li><li>Employee Accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not mandated for access to systems containing sensitive data. This critical oversight means that if primary credentials (username and password) for these systems are compromised, attackers can gain direct access to sensitive information without an additional layer of security. This exposes the organization to severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and significant reputational damage. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive Data Systems</li><li>Employee Accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Windows Policy - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A significant number of workstations within the organization are running Windows 7. This operating system has reached its end-of-life and no longer receives security updates or patches from Microsoft. Consequently, these systems are highly vulnerable to known exploits, malware, and zero-day attacks, making them easy targets for attackers and a potential entry point into the network. This was identified through an internal assessment.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately disable anonymous login on the FTP server and ensure all FTP access requires strong authentication. Furthermore, implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, specifically for email systems and all sensitive data systems, to significantly enhance account security. A comprehensive upgrade plan should be initiated to migrate all Windows 7 workstations to a currently supported operating system, such as Windows 10 or 11, to ensure they receive vital security updates. While the existing security awareness training and acceptable use policy are positive steps, consider incorporating specific modules addressing the risks of outdated software and the importance of MFA. Regularly review and update security policies to align with current best practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security through its acceptable use policy and regular security awareness training. However, critical vulnerabilities exist, including an anonymously accessible FTP server, the absence of MFA for email and sensitive data systems, and the continued use of end-of-life Windows 7 workstations. These issues collectively present a significant attack surface and elevate the risk of data breaches and system compromise. Addressing these high and critical severity risks promptly is paramount to improving the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and readiness against evolving threats.</p>
