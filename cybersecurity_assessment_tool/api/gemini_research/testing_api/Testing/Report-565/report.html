        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization operates a web server running Nginx version 1.18.0, exposed on port 443 (HTTPS). While the organization demonstrates good practices in security awareness training for all employees and maintains an acceptable use policy, significant security gaps exist regarding multi-factor authentication (MFA). Specifically, MFA is not required for accessing email or for logging into computers, which presents a substantial risk to user accounts and internal systems. MFA is, however, required for sensitive data systems.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require multi-factor authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee inboxes through credential stuffing, phishing, or brute-force attacks. A compromised email account can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and serve as a pivot point for further attacks within the network. This was identified from the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on email access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee email accounts</li><li>Email server infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is not enforced for logging into computers. This leaves employee workstations and potentially other internal systems vulnerable to unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or guessed. Without a second factor, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to a user's machine and potentially facilitate lateral movement across the network. This was identified from the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on computer logins.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Domain controllers (if applicable)</li><li>Remote access systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Nginx Web Server - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The web server is running Nginx version 1.18.0. This version is an older stable release (released April 2020) and is no longer actively maintained or receiving security updates. Running outdated software increases the risk of known vulnerabilities being exploited by attackers, potentially leading to denial of service, information disclosure, or remote code execution on the web server. This was identified during the network scan showing Nginx 1.18.0 on port 443.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Web server (Nginx 1.18.0) on port 443</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all email access and computer logins across the organization. This will significantly enhance account security and reduce the impact of credential theft. Furthermore, the Nginx web server should be updated to the latest stable version to ensure all known security vulnerabilities are patched and to benefit from ongoing security support. A regular patch management program should be established for all software and operating systems. While security awareness training is in place, reinforcing the importance of strong, unique passwords and the benefits of MFA during these sessions would be beneficial.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security through its acceptable use policy and consistent security awareness training. However, the absence of multi-factor authentication for critical access points like email and computer logins, coupled with the use of outdated web server software, introduces significant vulnerabilities. Addressing these MFA gaps and ensuring all software is kept up-to-date are crucial steps to enhance the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and readiness against modern threats.</p>
