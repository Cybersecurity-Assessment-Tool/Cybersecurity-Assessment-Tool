        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open port 80, indicating a potential web server. More critically, the organizational data highlights severe deficiencies in security posture. There is a complete absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct any security awareness training for new or existing employees. These factors collectively indicate a very low level of security readiness and a high susceptibility to various cyber threats.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for email access, computer logins, or sensitive data systems. This critical vulnerability means that if an attacker obtains a user's password through phishing, brute-force, or other means, they can gain full unauthorized access to critical systems and data without any additional authentication factor. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise and data breaches.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email systems</li><li>User workstations and network logins</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an acceptable use policy for employees. Without clear guidelines on the proper use of company assets, networks, and data, employees may inadvertently or intentionally engage in activities that pose security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive information. This increases the likelihood of insider threats, data leakage, and compliance violations.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All company assets (computers, networks, data)</li><li>Employee behavior and practices</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new or existing employees. This leaves the workforce highly vulnerable to social engineering attacks, phishing campaigns, malware, and other human-centric threats. Employees who are unaware of common attack vectors are more likely to fall victim to scams, inadvertently click malicious links, or disclose sensitive information, thereby becoming an easy entry point for attackers into the organization's network.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company network and data</li><li>Email systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open Port 80 (HTTP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The network scan identified an open port 80, indicating an active web server running HTTP. While not inherently a vulnerability, an unencrypted HTTP service can expose sensitive data transmitted over the network to eavesdropping. Furthermore, if the web server or the applications hosted on it are not properly secured, patched, and configured, they could be vulnerable to various web-based attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), or denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Web server on port 80</li><li>Associated web applications</li><li>Network traffic</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly improve the organization's security posture, immediate action is required. Firstly, implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical systems, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data access, to prevent unauthorized access even if passwords are compromised. Secondly, develop and enforce a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) to clearly define expected behavior and responsibilities regarding company assets and data. Thirdly, establish and regularly conduct mandatory security awareness training for all employees, both new hires and existing staff, to educate them on common cyber threats and best practices. Finally, address the open port 80 by ensuring the web server is properly secured, regularly patched, and configured to enforce HTTPS for all traffic to encrypt communications and protect against eavesdropping. Consider disabling HTTP if not strictly necessary, or redirecting all traffic to HTTPS.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to a lack of fundamental security controls and employee awareness. The absence of MFA, an AUP, and security training creates critical vulnerabilities that could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and operational disruption. While an open port 80 presents a medium risk, the human and policy-related vulnerabilities are severe. The organization's current readiness is low, and without immediate and comprehensive remediation, it remains highly susceptible to a wide range of cyberattacks.</p>
