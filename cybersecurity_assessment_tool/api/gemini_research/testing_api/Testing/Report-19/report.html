        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open SSH port (22), indicating a potential entry point for remote access. Organizational data indicates significant security posture weaknesses, primarily the complete absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, there is no employee acceptable use policy in place, which can lead to inconsistent security practices and increased risk. Positively, the organization does conduct security awareness training for new employees and annually for all employees, which helps mitigate some human-factor risks.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email, logging into computers, or accessing sensitive data systems. This critical vulnerability significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access. If an attacker compromises a single set of credentials (e.g., through phishing or credential stuffing), they gain full access to these critical systems without an additional layer of security, leading to potential data breaches, system compromise, and financial loss. This was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email systems</li><li>Employee computer logins</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This means there are no formal guidelines or rules for employees regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, internet access, email, and data handling. This absence can lead to misuse of company assets, increased exposure to malware, data breaches, and legal liabilities, as employees may unknowingly engage in risky behaviors or mishandle sensitive information. This was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Network infrastructure</li><li>Data handling processes</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port (Potential for Brute-Force/Exploitation) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An Nmap scan identified an open SSH (port 22) service. While SSH is a legitimate service for secure remote access, an open port presents a potential attack surface. Without proper hardening (e.g., strong passwords, key-based authentication, rate limiting, disabling root login, up-to-date software), this port can be targeted by brute-force attacks to guess credentials or exploited if the SSH server software has known vulnerabilities. This was identified through network scan data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Server hosting SSH service (port 22)</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, immediate implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points—email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems—is paramount. This single measure will drastically reduce the risk of unauthorized access from compromised credentials. Concurrently, the organization must develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to establish clear guidelines for IT resource usage, thereby minimizing internal risks and promoting responsible digital behavior. Furthermore, the identified open SSH port requires immediate attention; it should be secured by implementing strong authentication methods (e.g., key-based authentication, disabling password authentication), disabling root login, applying rate limiting, and ensuring the SSH server software is regularly patched and up-to-date. Continuing the existing security awareness training program will reinforce these new policies and practices among employees.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to the complete absence of Multi-Factor Authentication across critical systems and the lack of an employee acceptable use policy. These gaps create substantial vulnerabilities to unauthorized access and internal misuse. While the organization benefits from regular security awareness training, this alone is insufficient to counteract the fundamental weaknesses in access control and policy. Addressing these core issues, alongside securing the identified open SSH port, is crucial for improving the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and resilience against potential threats.</p>
