                "Summary": "The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins. However, a comprehensive network assessment was not possible due to broken scan data. Based on the provided organizational data, there are notable gaps in security controls related to sensitive data access, employee policies, and new employee training.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information should primary credentials be compromised. Without MFA, a single compromised password could lead to a severe data breach. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'Do you require MFA to access sensitive data systems?':'No'.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Sensitive data systems",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy",
                        "Overview": "The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This absence means there are no formal guidelines or rules for employees regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, data, and internet access. This can lead to increased risks such as data leakage, malware infections, and non-compliance with regulations due to unmanaged employee behavior. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'Does your organization have an employee acceptable use policy?':'No'.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",

                    {
                        "Risk": "No Security Awareness Training for New Employees",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. This leaves new hires vulnerable to common cyber threats like phishing, social engineering, and malware, as they may not be aware of the organization's security protocols and best practices from day one. While annual training is conducted for all employees, the initial onboarding period is a critical window for establishing a security-conscious culture. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'Does your organization do security awareness training for new employees?':'No'.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "New employees",
                            "Organizational data and systems"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access. Furthermore, a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy should be developed, communicated, and enforced across the entire organization to establish clear guidelines for IT resource usage. Finally, a mandatory security awareness training program must be introduced for all new employees as part of their onboarding process, ensuring they are equipped with essential cybersecurity knowledge from their first day. Regular, engaging training for all employees should continue annually.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently exhibits a mixed security posture. While MFA is in place for email and computer logins, critical vulnerabilities exist due to the lack of MFA for sensitive data systems, the absence of an employee acceptable use policy, and the omission of security awareness training for new employees. These gaps expose the organization to significant risks of data breaches, operational disruptions, and compliance failures. Addressing these areas is crucial for enhancing overall cybersecurity readiness and establishing a more robust defense against evolving threats."
