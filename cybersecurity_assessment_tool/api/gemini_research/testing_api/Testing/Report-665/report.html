        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to access control by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, and has an acceptable use policy in place. However, a significant gap exists in its security awareness program, as there is no training for new employees or annual training for all employees. A network scan revealed an open Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) port (3389) on an external interface, indicating a potential attack vector.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>RDP Exposure - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed to the internet, which can allow unauthorized access to internal systems. This was identified by an open port 3389 during the network scan. The impact could range from unauthorized access to full system compromise if credentials are breached or vulnerabilities in the RDP service are exploited.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately close port 3389 to the internet, or at a minimum, restrict access to trusted IP addresses. For secure remote access, implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution. Furthermore, the organization should establish and regularly conduct security awareness training for all employees, including new hires, to educate them on common threats like phishing, social engineering, and the importance of strong password practices and reporting suspicious activities. This will address the lack of training identified in the organizational data.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has a good foundation with MFA implementation and an acceptable use policy, the lack of security awareness training and the critical RDP exposure pose significant risks. Addressing the open RDP port is an immediate priority to prevent potential external attacks, and implementing comprehensive security awareness training is crucial for building a resilient human firewall against internal and external threats.</p>
