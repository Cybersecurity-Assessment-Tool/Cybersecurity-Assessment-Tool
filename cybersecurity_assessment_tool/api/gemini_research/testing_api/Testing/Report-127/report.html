        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to cybersecurity by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, maintaining an employee acceptable use policy, and conducting annual security awareness training for all employees. However, critical gaps exist in the security posture. Specifically, MFA is not enforced for sensitive data systems, and new employees do not receive initial security awareness training. Network scanning also identified an open SSH port (22), which, while a legitimate service, represents an exposed attack surface if not adequately secured.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Access Control for Sensitive Data - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if primary credentials are compromised (e.g., via phishing, keylogging, or brute-force attacks). Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to sensitive data, leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and severe reputational damage. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Untrained New Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees upon onboarding. This leaves new hires vulnerable to common social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) and unaware of organizational security policies and best practices from the start. Untrained employees can inadvertently introduce malware, expose credentials, or violate data handling policies, posing an immediate risk to the organization's security posture and potentially leading to security incidents. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>Organizational network</li><li>Organizational data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed SSH Service - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An Nmap scan revealed that port 22 (SSH) is open on a host within the network. While SSH is a legitimate service for secure remote administration, an exposed SSH port, if not properly secured (e.g., with strong passwords/key-based authentication, rate limiting, IP restrictions, and up-to-date software), can be a target for brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or exploitation of known vulnerabilities in older SSH versions. This could lead to unauthorized remote access to the system, potentially compromising the host and further internal network access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with open port 22</li><li>SSH service</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access even if primary credentials are compromised. Furthermore, a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees should be established as an integral part of their onboarding process to educate them on security best practices and organizational policies from day one. The exposed SSH service on port 22 requires immediate hardening, including enforcing strong authentication methods (e.g., key-based authentication), implementing IP-based access restrictions, configuring rate limiting, and ensuring the SSH server software is regularly updated and patched. The organization should continue its current practices of annual security awareness training and maintaining an acceptable use policy, reinforcing these efforts with the new recommendations.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has some foundational security measures in place, critical vulnerabilities exist that could lead to significant security incidents. The absence of MFA for sensitive data systems and the lack of initial security training for new employees represent substantial risks that could be exploited by attackers. Additionally, the exposed SSH service requires immediate attention to prevent unauthorized access. Addressing these identified vulnerabilities is paramount to improving the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and protecting its sensitive assets from potential threats.</p>
