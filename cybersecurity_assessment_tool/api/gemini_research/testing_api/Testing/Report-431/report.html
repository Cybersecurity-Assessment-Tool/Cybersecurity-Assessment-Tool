        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan identified an open SSH port (22), indicating a potential entry point that requires robust security measures. While the organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and conducts regular security awareness training for all employees, significant gaps exist in MFA adoption for email access and sensitive data systems. An additional critical vulnerability related to localhost exposure was also identified, posing a risk for internal reconnaissance or privilege escalation.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The system appears to have services or configurations that expose localhost interfaces, potentially allowing unauthorized access or information disclosure from within the network. This could lead to internal reconnaissance or privilege escalation if an attacker gains a foothold.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed SSH Service - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH (Secure Shell) port (22) was detected on a host. While SSH is a legitimate service for remote administration, an exposed port without proper security measures (e.g., strong passwords, key-based authentication, rate limiting, IP restrictions) can be a target for brute-force attacks or exploitation of SSH vulnerabilities, leading to unauthorized remote access and potential system compromise.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 22</li><li>Network perimeter</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of email account compromise through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks. A single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to an employee's email, leading to data breaches, business email compromise (BEC) scams, or further internal network access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if a user's password is compromised. Attackers could gain direct access to confidential information, leading to severe data breaches, regulatory fines, and significant reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Critical databases</li><li>Confidential files</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately investigate and restrict access to any services exposing localhost interfaces. For the exposed SSH service, implement robust security practices including disabling password authentication in favor of key-based authentication, configuring fail2ban or similar tools for brute-force protection, and restricting SSH access to trusted IP addresses only. Crucially, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be implemented for all email accounts and sensitive data systems to significantly reduce the risk of account compromise and unauthorized data access. The organization should continue its commendable efforts in security awareness training and maintain its employee acceptable use policy, ensuring these policies are regularly reviewed and updated to address emerging threats.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to cybersecurity through its existing security awareness training and MFA for computer logins. However, the presence of critical vulnerabilities related to localhost exposure and the significant gaps in MFA implementation for email and sensitive data systems pose substantial risks. Addressing these high and critical severity issues promptly is paramount to enhancing the organization's overall security posture and protecting its sensitive assets from potential cyber threats.</p>
