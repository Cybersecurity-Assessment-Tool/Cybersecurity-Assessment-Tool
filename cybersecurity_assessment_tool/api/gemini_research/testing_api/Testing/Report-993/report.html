        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to access control by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. An employee acceptable use policy is also in place, and annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees. However, a critical vulnerability was identified during network scanning: a service titled 'TOP SECRET DB' is openly accessible on port 8080. Furthermore, a gap exists in the onboarding process as new employees do not receive dedicated security awareness training.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed Sensitive Database Service - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A service identified by the title 'TOP SECRET DB' is openly accessible on port 8080. This exposure presents a critical risk of unauthorized access to highly sensitive data, potentially leading to severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and significant reputational damage. The service's title explicitly indicates the sensitive nature of the information it handles. This vulnerability was identified through an Nmap scan that revealed an open port 8080 with the HTTP title 'TOP SECRET DB'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li><li>Service with HTTP title 'TOP SECRET DB'</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of New Employee Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks a formal security awareness training program for new employees during their onboarding process. This oversight means new hires may not be adequately informed about critical security policies, best practices, and potential threats from day one. This increases the risk of human-factor vulnerabilities, such as phishing susceptibility, improper handling of sensitive information, or unintentional policy violations, which could compromise the organization's security posture. This was identified from the organizational data indicating 'No' for 'Does your organization do security awareness training for new employees?'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediate action is required to secure the 'TOP SECRET DB' service exposed on port 8080. This should involve restricting network access to only authorized personnel and systems, implementing robust authentication and authorization mechanisms, and thoroughly reviewing the necessity of its public exposure. Additionally, a comprehensive security awareness training program must be integrated into the onboarding process for all new employees to ensure they are equipped with essential security knowledge from the start. Regular, comprehensive vulnerability scans and penetration tests should be conducted to proactively identify and remediate similar exposures. Finally, a review of access controls for all sensitive data systems is recommended to ensure the principle of least privilege is strictly enforced.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has established a solid foundation in access control through MFA implementation across critical systems and an acceptable use policy, the discovery of an exposed 'TOP SECRET DB' service on port 8080 represents a critical and immediate security threat. This vulnerability, coupled with the absence of security awareness training for new employees, highlights significant areas for improvement. Addressing these critical vulnerabilities, particularly the exposed database, is paramount to enhancing the organization's overall security posture and readiness against potential cyber threats and data breaches.</p>
