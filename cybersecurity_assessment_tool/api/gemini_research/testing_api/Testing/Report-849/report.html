        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network assessment revealed a critical vulnerability with an open port 8080 exposing a service titled 'TOP SECRET DB', indicating a severe information disclosure risk. Furthermore, the organization exhibits significant gaps in its security posture, including the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems. There is no employee acceptable use policy in place, and new employees do not receive security awareness training, although annual training is provided for all existing employees. These findings collectively point to a heightened risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and operational disruption.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed Sensitive Database (Port 8080) - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An Nmap scan identified an open port 8080 on a host, revealing a service titled 'TOP SECRET DB'. This indicates a critical information disclosure vulnerability, potentially allowing unauthorized access to highly sensitive data. The impact could be severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and significant reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li><li>TOP SECRET DB service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for email access. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing or credential stuffing attacks, potentially leading to business email compromise (BEC) and unauthorized access to sensitive communications. This was identified through a review of organizational security policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MFA is not required for accessing sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are compromised, posing a high risk of data breaches and intellectual property theft. This was identified through a review of organizational security policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This absence means there are no clear guidelines for employees regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, increasing the risk of misuse, data leakage, and non-compliance with security best practices. This was identified through a review of organizational policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All IT systems</li><li>Employee conduct</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training upon joining the organization. This leaves them susceptible to common social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) and unaware of critical security protocols from the outset, increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents. This was identified through a review of organizational training programs.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Overall security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediate action is required to address the critical vulnerability on port 8080; the 'TOP SECRET DB' service should be secured, removed, or properly firewalled. It is strongly recommended to implement and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and sensitive data systems to significantly enhance credential security. The organization must develop and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to establish clear guidelines for IT resource usage. Furthermore, a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees should be introduced, complementing the existing annual training for all staff, to foster a strong security culture from day one.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several significant cybersecurity risks, highlighted by an exposed 'TOP SECRET DB' on an open port, critical gaps in MFA implementation for email and sensitive data, and deficiencies in foundational security policies and new employee training. While annual security awareness training is a positive step, the identified vulnerabilities and policy gaps indicate a low overall security readiness. Addressing these issues promptly and comprehensively is crucial to mitigate potential data breaches, maintain regulatory compliance, and protect the organization's assets and reputation.</p>
