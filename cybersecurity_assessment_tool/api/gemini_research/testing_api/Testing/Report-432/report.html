        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Based on the provided organizational data, this assessment focuses on the current security policies and practices related to multi-factor authentication (MFA) and acceptable use policies. Due to broken network scan data and current risks information, a comprehensive technical network vulnerability assessment could not be performed. The organization currently conducts security awareness training for both new and existing employees annually, which is a positive aspect of its security posture. However, critical gaps exist in the implementation of MFA and the presence of an acceptable use policy.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee inboxes if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. A single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to sensitive communications and potentially lead to further internal network penetration. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on email access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email accounts</li><li>Employee communication systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for employees to log into their computers. This leaves user workstations vulnerable to unauthorized access if a user's password is stolen or guessed. Attackers could gain access to internal systems, data, and potentially deploy malware or ransomware. This vulnerability was identified from the organizational data stating 'No' for MFA on computer login.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>User workstations</li><li>Internal network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk, as compromised credentials could allow unauthorized individuals direct access to confidential information, intellectual property, or customer data. The impact could include data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and significant reputational damage. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on sensitive data systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases containing confidential information</li><li>Critical business applications</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks an employee acceptable use policy (AUP). Without a formal AUP, employees may not be fully aware of their responsibilities regarding the use of company IT resources, data handling, and internet usage. This can lead to increased risks such as misuse of company assets, inadvertent data leakage, exposure to malicious websites, and a general lack of accountability for security best practices. This was identified through the organizational data stating 'No' for an acceptable use policy.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>It is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, including email systems, computer logins, and especially sensitive data systems, to significantly enhance protection against credential-based attacks. Furthermore, a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy (AUP) should be developed, communicated, and enforced to establish clear guidelines for responsible IT resource usage and data handling. While security awareness training is already in place, it should be updated to specifically cover the importance of MFA and the details of the new AUP. Regular audits of MFA implementation and AUP compliance should also be conducted.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security through its regular security awareness training programs. However, a significant gap exists in its readiness due to the complete absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, which represents a critical vulnerability. The lack of an acceptable use policy further exposes the organization to human-factor risks. Addressing these core deficiencies is paramount to improving the overall security posture and mitigating the high risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.</p>
