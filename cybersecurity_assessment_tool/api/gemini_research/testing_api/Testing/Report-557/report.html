        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) on port 3389, which is a significant security concern. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for email and sensitive data systems, it is not required for computer logins, leaving a potential access vector vulnerable. Furthermore, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not provide security awareness training for new employees, although annual training is conducted for all staff.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>RDP Exposure - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) port (3389) was found to be open and accessible from the network. This exposes the system to potential brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, and exploitation of RDP vulnerabilities, which could lead to unauthorized access and compromise of the affected system. This was identified via a network port scan.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>System with open RDP port (3389)</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately close the exposed RDP port (3389) or restrict access to it via a firewall. For secure remote access, implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution. Furthermore, enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to enhance access security. Develop and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to define expected behavior and security responsibilities. Finally, introduce mandatory security awareness training for all new employees to ensure they are aware of security best practices from day one, complementing the existing annual training.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization faces a critical security risk due to an exposed Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) port, which significantly increases the attack surface for unauthorized access. While MFA is in place for email and sensitive data, its absence for computer logins represents a notable vulnerability. Gaps in security policies, specifically the lack of an employee acceptable use policy and security awareness training for new employees, further diminish the overall security posture. Addressing these critical technical vulnerabilities and policy deficiencies is paramount to improving the organization's cybersecurity readiness.</p>
