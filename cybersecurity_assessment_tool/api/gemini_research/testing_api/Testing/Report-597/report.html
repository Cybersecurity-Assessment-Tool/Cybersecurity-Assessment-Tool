        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The network scan identified an open port 8080 hosting a service titled 'TOP SECRET DB', indicating a critical exposure of potentially sensitive data. Furthermore, the organization's self-reported data reveals significant gaps in fundamental security practices. There is no Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) required for email, computer logins, or sensitive data systems. The organization also lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct security awareness training for new or existing employees. These combined deficiencies point to a low level of security readiness and a high overall risk posture.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed 'TOP SECRET DB' on Port 8080 - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open port 8080 was discovered, hosting a service with the title 'TOP SECRET DB'. This indicates that a potentially sensitive database or application is directly accessible from the network, possibly without adequate authentication or authorization. The explicit labeling as 'TOP SECRET DB' suggests the presence of highly confidential information. The exposure of such a system poses an extreme risk of data breach, unauthorized access, and compromise of sensitive information. This was identified via an Nmap scan, specifically the http-title script.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li><li>Service titled 'TOP SECRET DB'</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for accessing email, logging into computers, or accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly weakens authentication mechanisms, making accounts highly susceptible to credential stuffing, phishing, and brute-force attacks. A single compromised password could grant an attacker access to multiple critical systems, leading to widespread data breaches and system compromise.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email access</li><li>Computer logins</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without a clear AUP, employees may unknowingly engage in activities that pose security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive data. This increases the likelihood of insider threats, malware infections, and data leakage due to a lack of defined boundaries and expectations for technology usage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Organizational security posture</li><li>Employee behavior</li><li>Data handling practices</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or annually for all employees. This leaves the workforce vulnerable to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting), malware, and other human-centric threats. Employees who are unaware of common attack vectors and best security practices are more likely to fall victim to attacks, serving as an easy entry point for adversaries into the organization's network.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee susceptibility to social engineering</li><li>Overall organizational security</li><li>Data protection</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediately investigate the service running on port 8080, determine its legitimacy and data contents, and implement strong access controls, firewall rules, and proper authentication/encryption. If it is not a legitimate service, it must be shut down and removed. Implement mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, as a top priority. Develop and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy, ensuring all employees read, understand, and acknowledge it. Establish a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees and conduct annual refresher training for all staff, covering topics such as phishing, password hygiene, data handling, and incident reporting.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks stemming from both critical technical vulnerabilities and severe policy/training deficiencies. The discovery of an exposed 'TOP SECRET DB' on an open port 8080 represents an immediate and severe threat of data breach. This is compounded by the complete absence of Multi-Factor Authentication across key systems, along with the lack of an acceptable use policy and security awareness training, which indicates a very low level of security readiness. Without urgent remediation of these issues, the organization remains highly susceptible to a wide range of cyberattacks, with potentially devastating impacts on data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Immediate action is required to implement fundamental security controls and educate the workforce to improve the overall security posture.</p>
