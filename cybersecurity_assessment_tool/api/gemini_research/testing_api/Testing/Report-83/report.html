        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open SSH port (22). While multi-factor authentication (MFA) is implemented for email and sensitive data systems, it is not required for computer logins. The organization has an employee acceptable use policy but currently lacks security awareness training for both new and existing employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A critical vulnerability was identified where the localhost interface appears to be exposed, potentially allowing unauthorized external access to internal services. This could lead to full system compromise, data exfiltration, or denial of service. The risk was identified through network scanning and analysis of exposed services.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>It is strongly recommended to immediately investigate and remediate the 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability to prevent critical system compromise. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to significantly enhance endpoint security. Furthermore, establish and conduct regular security awareness training for all employees, including new hires, to educate them on common threats, phishing, and best security practices, thereby strengthening the organization's human firewall.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization exhibits a mixed security posture. While some critical areas like email and sensitive data access are protected by MFA, significant vulnerabilities exist in endpoint security due to the lack of MFA for computer logins and a complete absence of security awareness training. The identified 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability presents an immediate and critical risk that requires urgent attention to prevent potential system compromise and data breaches. Addressing these gaps is crucial for improving overall cybersecurity readiness and reducing the attack surface.</p>
