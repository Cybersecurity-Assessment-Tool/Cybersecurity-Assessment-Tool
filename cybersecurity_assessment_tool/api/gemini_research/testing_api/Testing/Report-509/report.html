        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open RDP port (3389), indicating potential external exposure. Internally, the organization has implemented an acceptable use policy and provides security awareness training for new employees. However, there are significant gaps in multi-factor authentication (MFA) implementation, as it is not required for email or computer logins, although it is used for sensitive data systems. Annual security awareness training for all employees is also not conducted.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A network scan identified that port 3389, commonly used for Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), is open and accessible. This exposure allows potential attackers to attempt brute-force attacks or exploit known vulnerabilities in the RDP service to gain unauthorized access to internal systems. The impact could range from unauthorized access to data exfiltration or system compromise. This was identified via an Nmap scan showing port 3389 as open.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host IP (specific IP not provided, but implied by scan)</li><li>Port 3389 (ms-wbt-server service)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks. If an attacker obtains an employee's email credentials, they could gain access to sensitive communications, impersonate the employee, or pivot to other systems. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for logging into computers within the organization. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are compromised. An attacker gaining access to a computer could potentially access internal network resources, install malware, or escalate privileges. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations</li><li>Servers (if applicable)</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This leads to a degradation of security knowledge over time, making employees more susceptible to social engineering attacks, phishing, and other human-factor vulnerabilities. A lack of regular reinforcement can result in employees forgetting best practices, increasing the overall risk of security incidents. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediately close port 3389 to external access. Implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) for secure remote access, requiring strong authentication (preferably MFA) before allowing RDP connections to internal systems. Ensure RDP services are patched and configured with strong, complex passwords. Implement mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and computer logins across the organization. This significantly enhances protection against credential theft and unauthorized access. Evaluate and deploy suitable MFA solutions that integrate with existing identity management systems. Establish and enforce a policy for mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees. This training should cover current threats, phishing recognition, password hygiene, data handling, and incident reporting procedures to maintain a high level of security consciousness. Regularly review and update security policies, conduct vulnerability scans, and perform penetration testing to identify and address new risks proactively.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization faces critical and high-severity risks primarily due to an exposed RDP service and significant gaps in Multi-Factor Authentication implementation for email and computer logins. While some foundational security practices like an acceptable use policy and new employee training are in place, the absence of annual security awareness training for all employees further exacerbates the human-factor risk. Addressing these vulnerabilities, particularly the RDP exposure and MFA gaps, is paramount to significantly improving the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and readiness against common attack vectors.</p>
