            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network assessment reveals a security posture with both strengths and weaknesses. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is effectively utilized for email and computer logins, demonstrating a commitment to access control. However, a significant gap exists as MFA is not required for accessing sensitive data systems. Additionally, the absence of an employee acceptable use policy represents a policy-level vulnerability. On the positive side, the organization conducts regular security awareness training for both new and existing employees. A specific vulnerability identified is an unencrypted web server, indicating a potential exposure on port 80.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Unencrypted Web Server",
                        "Overview": "An unencrypted web server was identified, exposing potential data in transit to interception. The presence of an open port 80, typically used for unencrypted HTTP traffic, indicates this vulnerability. This could lead to sensitive information disclosure if not properly secured.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Port 80"
                        ]

                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems",
                        "Overview": "Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is not enforced for access to sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical data if primary credentials are compromised, as there is no secondary verification layer.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Sensitive data systems access controls"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy",
                        "Overview": "The organization currently lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. This absence creates a gap in defining expected employee behavior regarding IT resource usage, data handling, and security responsibilities. Without clear guidelines, employees may inadvertently engage in risky behaviors, increasing the likelihood of security incidents, data breaches, or compliance violations.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Organizational policy",
                            "Employee conduct"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement multi-factor authentication for all sensitive data systems immediately to prevent unauthorized access. For the unencrypted web server, the immediate action should be to close port 80 if it's not intentionally serving content, or, as a long-term solution, implement SSL/TLS encryption for all web traffic and redirect HTTP to HTTPS. Furthermore, the organization must develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to clearly define acceptable IT resource usage and security responsibilities. Regular reviews of security policies and controls, especially around sensitive data access, are also advised.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security through MFA for general access and consistent security awareness training. However, critical gaps exist, particularly with the lack of MFA for sensitive data systems and the absence of an acceptable use policy. The presence of an unencrypted web server further highlights areas requiring immediate attention. Addressing these vulnerabilities is crucial for enhancing the overall security posture and protecting sensitive assets from potential threats."
