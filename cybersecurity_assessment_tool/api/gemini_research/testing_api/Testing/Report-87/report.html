        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently has an open MySQL port (3306), which exposes the database to potential unauthorized access. While the organization implements MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, it lacks MFA for email access. Furthermore, there is no employee acceptable use policy in place, and annual security awareness training for all employees is not conducted, despite training new employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network, allowing potential external access to the database. This could lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion, severely impacting data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The vulnerability was identified through a network scan showing port 3306 in an open state.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing or credential stuffing attacks, as a single compromised password could grant an an attacker full access to an employee's email, potentially leading to further internal system access or business email compromise (BEC) scams. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy (AUP). Without a clear AUP, employees may unknowingly engage in activities that pose security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive data. This absence creates ambiguity regarding expected behavior and makes it harder to enforce security best practices, increasing the overall risk of insider threats and accidental data breaches. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data and systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This means that employees may not be updated on the latest threats, best practices, or changes in organizational policies, leading to a degradation of security posture over time. Regular training is crucial to maintain a strong human firewall against evolving cyber threats like phishing, social engineering, and malware. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data and systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted internal sources or specific IP addresses. For long-term security, consider placing the database behind a VPN or within a more isolated network segment. Additionally, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) should be mandated for all email access to significantly reduce the risk of account compromise. The organization must develop and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy (AUP) to clearly define expected behavior regarding IT resource usage and data handling. Finally, regular, at least annual, security awareness training should be conducted for all employees to ensure they are continuously informed about current cyber threats and best security practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several significant cybersecurity risks, primarily stemming from an exposed MySQL database and critical gaps in its security policies and training programs. While some positive steps have been taken with MFA for computer logins and sensitive data, the lack of MFA for email, absence of an acceptable use policy, and infrequent security awareness training for all employees create substantial vulnerabilities. Addressing these issues through immediate technical controls and robust policy implementation is crucial to enhance the organization's overall security posture and readiness against evolving cyber threats.</p>
