            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network currently exposes an Nginx web server (version 1.18.0) on port 443 (HTTPS). While HTTPS is used for secure communication, the Nginx version is outdated. From an organizational policy perspective, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required for email access, which is a positive step. However, MFA is not mandated for computer logins or access to sensitive data systems, representing significant authentication weaknesses. The organization has an acceptable use policy and conducts annual security awareness training for all employees, but new employees do not receive initial security awareness training during onboarding.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Outdated Nginx Web Server",
                        "Overview": "The Nginx web server running on port 443 is version 1.18.0. This version is significantly outdated and is known to have multiple security vulnerabilities that have been patched in newer releases. Running outdated software exposes the system to potential exploits, including remote code execution, denial of service, and information disclosure, which could compromise the web server and potentially other connected systems. This was identified through network scanning.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Nginx 1.18.0 on port 443"

                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Computer Logins",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee workstations and the internal network if user credentials are stolen, phished, or brute-forced. A single factor (password) is insufficient to protect against modern credential-based attacks, making the organization vulnerable to lateral movement and data exfiltration. This was identified through a review of organizational policies.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Employee workstations",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems",
                        "Overview": "Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access sensitive data systems. This is a critical vulnerability as it leaves the most valuable organizational assets exposed to unauthorized access if a single set of credentials is compromised. A breach of sensitive data can lead to severe financial penalties, regulatory non-compliance, reputational damage, and loss of customer trust. This was identified through a review of organizational policies.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",

                    {
                        "Risk": "No Security Awareness Training for New Employees",
                        "Overview": "New employees do not receive security awareness training upon joining the organization. This creates a critical gap where new hires may be unaware of essential security policies, common social engineering tactics (e.g., phishing), and proper data handling procedures. This lack of initial training increases the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents, such as clicking malicious links, falling for phishing scams, or mishandling sensitive information. This was identified through a review of organizational policies.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "New employees",
                            "Organizational security posture"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately upgrade the Nginx web server to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities. Furthermore, implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and, most critically, for all sensitive data systems, should be prioritized to significantly enhance authentication security. While annual security awareness training is in place, it is crucial to introduce mandatory security awareness training for all new employees during their onboarding process to ensure they are equipped with essential security knowledge from day one. Regular vulnerability scanning and patch management should be established for all internet-facing assets.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing MFA for email and conducting annual security awareness training. However, significant vulnerabilities exist, particularly with an outdated Nginx web server and critical gaps in MFA implementation for computer logins and sensitive data systems. The absence of security awareness training for new employees also presents a notable risk. Addressing these issues, especially the MFA and software patching deficiencies, is paramount to improving the overall security posture and reducing the likelihood of a successful cyberattack or data breach."
