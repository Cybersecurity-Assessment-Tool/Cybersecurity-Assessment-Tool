        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Based on the network scan, a single host was identified as 'up' with an open port 443, running Nginx version 1.18.0 for HTTPS. This indicates the presence of a web server, likely serving external or internal web applications. Organizational data reveals critical gaps in multi-factor authentication implementation, employee policy, and ongoing security awareness training.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Web Server Software - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nginx web server running on port 443 is version 1.18.0. While this is a stable release, it is not the latest version and may be missing critical security patches that have been released in subsequent updates. Running outdated software can expose the organization to known vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit to gain unauthorized access, disrupt services, or compromise data. This was identified through the network scan.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Nginx 1.18.0 on port 443</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. If an attacker obtains an employee's email password, they can gain full access to their email, potentially leading to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, or further lateral movement within the network. This was identified from the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee email accounts</li><li>Email system</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This leaves employee workstations vulnerable to unauthorized access if passwords are stolen, guessed, or cracked. A compromised workstation can serve as an entry point for attackers to access internal resources, deploy malware, or escalate privileges. This was identified from the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without a clear AUP, employees may be unaware of their responsibilities regarding the use of company IT resources, data handling, and internet usage. This can lead to risky behaviors, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive information, increasing the likelihood of security incidents. This was identified from the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>IT systems</li><li>Data handling procedures</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, there is no annual training for all employees. Cybersecurity threats evolve rapidly, and without regular updates, employees may not be aware of the latest phishing techniques, social engineering tactics, or emerging malware. This gap in ongoing education increases the organization's susceptibility to human-factor attacks. This was identified from the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and computer logins. The Nginx web server should be upgraded to the latest stable version to ensure all known security vulnerabilities are patched, and a routine vulnerability scanning program should be established. Furthermore, the organization must develop and enforce a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) that clearly outlines employee responsibilities. Finally, a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees should be established to ensure ongoing education on evolving cyber threats and best practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several significant cybersecurity risks, primarily stemming from a lack of fundamental security controls and policies. The absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for email and computer logins, coupled with an outdated web server and gaps in security awareness training and policy enforcement, creates a substantial attack surface. While MFA is in place for sensitive data systems and new employees receive training, these measures are insufficient to provide comprehensive protection. Addressing these vulnerabilities through policy implementation, technology upgrades, and ongoing employee education is crucial to enhance the organization's overall security posture and readiness against evolving cyber threats.</p>
