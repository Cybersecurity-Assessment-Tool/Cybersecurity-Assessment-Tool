                "Summary": "The organization's network scan revealed an open Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) port (3389) directly exposed to the internet. While the organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems, it does not require MFA for computer logins. Additionally, there is no formal employee acceptable use policy in place. On a positive note, the organization conducts security awareness training for new employees and annually for all staff.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "RDP Exposure",
                        "Overview": "Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed directly to the internet via an open port (3389). This allows external attackers to attempt brute-force attacks or exploit RDP vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to internal systems. A successful compromise could lead to full system control, data exfiltration, or further network penetration. Identified via Nmap scan showing port 3389 as open.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Inadequate Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for employees logging into their computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if employee credentials are stolen or compromised through phishing, malware, or other means. Without a second factor, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's workstation and potentially the internal network. Identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employee workstations",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Missing Employee Acceptable Use Policy",
                        "Overview": "The organization currently lacks a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). This absence means there are no clear guidelines for employees regarding the appropriate and secure use of company IT resources, data, and internet access. This can lead to increased risks such as inadvertent data leakage, introduction of malware through unauthorized software installations or website visits, and potential legal liabilities due to misuse of company assets. Identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "Company IT infrastructure",
                            "Sensitive data"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is critical to immediately close the publicly exposed RDP port (3389) and implement secure access methods, such as a Virtual Private Network (VPN), for remote administration. Furthermore, the organization should prioritize the implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to significantly enhance endpoint security and reduce the risk of credential theft. A comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) must be developed, communicated, and enforced to clearly define expectations for secure and appropriate use of company IT resources, thereby reducing human-factor risks. Regular review and updates of security policies, alongside ongoing security awareness training, are also recommended to ensure continuous improvement in the organization's security posture.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security through the use of MFA for email and sensitive data systems, as well as consistent security awareness training. However, critical vulnerabilities exist, notably the direct exposure of RDP to the internet, which presents an immediate and severe risk. Furthermore, the absence of MFA for computer logins and a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy creates significant gaps in endpoint security and overall governance. Addressing these high-priority risks is crucial for enhancing the organization's cybersecurity posture and readiness against evolving threats."
