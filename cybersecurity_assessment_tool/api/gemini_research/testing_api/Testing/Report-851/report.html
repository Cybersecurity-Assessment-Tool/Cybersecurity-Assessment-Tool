        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and conducts regular security awareness training for all employees. However, significant security gaps were identified, including the absence of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, and a lack of an employee acceptable use policy. Network scans revealed an open SSH port (22), and a critical vulnerability related to a localhost service being exposed was also identified, indicating potential misconfigurations and an elevated risk profile.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Service Exposure - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A critical service intended for local access only has been found to be exposed, potentially to the wider network or even the internet. This could allow unauthorized access to sensitive internal systems or data, leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service. The exact nature of the exposed service needs further investigation, but its presence indicates a severe misconfiguration or architectural flaw.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Computer Login Security - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for employees to log into their computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised through phishing, keyloggers, or brute-force attacks. A single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to an employee's workstation and potentially the internal network.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Login systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Sensitive Data System Security - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not mandated for accessing sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access even if primary credentials are stolen. Attackers gaining access to these systems could lead to severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, financial loss, and reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>File shares</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Uncontrolled Employee Behavior - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy (AUP). Without a clear AUP, employees may unknowingly engage in activities that pose security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling company data. This increases the likelihood of malware infections, data leakage, and compliance violations due to a lack of defined boundaries and expectations for technology usage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational policies</li><li>IT systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed SSH Service - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A network scan identified an open SSH port (22). While SSH is a legitimate service for remote administration, an open port without proper security controls (e.g., strong passwords, key-based authentication, IP whitelisting, rate limiting) can be a target for brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or exploitation of SSH vulnerabilities. This could lead to unauthorized remote access to the system.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li><li>Port 22</li><li>SSH service</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, the organization should implement the following recommendations: 1. Immediately investigate and remediate the exposed localhost service by reconfiguring network access controls, firewall rules, or the service itself to ensure it is only accessible from authorized internal sources or localhost. 2. Deploy and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all employee computer logins to significantly enhance security against credential theft. 3. Mandate Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to all sensitive data systems to protect critical information from unauthorized access. 4. Create and disseminate a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy (AUP) that clearly outlines expectations for technology usage, data handling, and security best practices, ensuring all employees acknowledge and adhere to this policy. 5. Review the necessity of the open SSH port (22); if required, implement robust security measures such as using SSH keys instead of passwords, restricting access to specific IP addresses, implementing strong password policies, and regularly patching the SSH server. If not required, close the port. 6. Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address new vulnerabilities proactively.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security through MFA for email and regular security awareness training. However, critical vulnerabilities exist, particularly regarding the lack of MFA for computer and sensitive data system access, the absence of an acceptable use policy, and an exposed localhost service. The open SSH port also presents a significant attack surface. Addressing these gaps is crucial to enhance the overall security posture, protect sensitive data, and reduce the risk of successful cyberattacks. Prioritizing the implementation of MFA across all critical access points and establishing clear employee usage policies are immediate steps to improve readiness.</p>
