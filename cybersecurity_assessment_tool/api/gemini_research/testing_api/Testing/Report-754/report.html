        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Based on the provided organizational data, the network's security posture is significantly weakened by the absence of multi-factor authentication (MFA) across critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization lacks essential security awareness training for both new and existing employees, which increases the risk of human-factor vulnerabilities such as phishing and social engineering attacks. While an acceptable use policy is in place, the lack of foundational security controls and training indicates a low level of readiness against common cyber threats.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee inboxes if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. Compromised email accounts can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and further internal network penetration.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email accounts</li><li>email servers</li><li>user authentication systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for logging into computers. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if user credentials are stolen or guessed. A compromised computer can serve as an entry point for attackers to move laterally within the network, escalate privileges, and access sensitive data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>servers</li><li>domain controllers</li><li>user authentication systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for accessing sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive information. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to critical data, potentially leading to data breaches, regulatory fines, and reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Databases</li><li>file servers</li><li>CRM systems</li><li>ERP systems</li><li>cloud storage</li><li>any system containing sensitive organizational or customer data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees are not provided with security awareness training. This means they may not be aware of common cyber threats, organizational security policies, or best practices for protecting sensitive information from the outset. This increases the likelihood of new hires falling victim to social engineering attacks or inadvertently introducing vulnerabilities.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>organizational data</li><li>network security</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Regular Security Awareness Training for All Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. Without regular training, employees' knowledge of evolving cyber threats and security best practices can become outdated. This increases the overall human risk factor, making the organization more susceptible to phishing, malware, and other social engineering tactics.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>organizational data</li><li>network security</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, including email systems, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. This foundational control will drastically reduce the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials. Concurrently, a comprehensive security awareness training program must be established. This program should include mandatory training for all new employees during onboarding and annual refresher training for all existing staff. Training should cover topics such as phishing identification, password hygiene, data handling best practices, and incident reporting procedures. Regular training will empower employees to become a strong line of defense against cyber threats.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to the widespread absence of multi-factor authentication and a lack of a robust security awareness training program. While an acceptable use policy is in place, the fundamental controls to protect against credential compromise and human-factor vulnerabilities are missing. This indicates a low level of readiness against common and impactful cyber threats. Addressing these critical gaps through the immediate implementation of MFA and a comprehensive, ongoing security awareness training program is paramount to improving the organization's overall security posture and reducing its susceptibility to data breaches and other cyber incidents.</p>
