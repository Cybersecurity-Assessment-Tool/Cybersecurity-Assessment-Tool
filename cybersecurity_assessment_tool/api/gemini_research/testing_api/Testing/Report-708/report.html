        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>A detailed network summary could not be generated due to broken network scan data. However, an assessment of the organization's security posture based on provided organizational data reveals several critical areas of concern regarding authentication, policy enforcement, and ongoing employee security awareness. While MFA is used for email access and new employees receive security training, significant gaps exist in protecting computer logins, sensitive data systems, and establishing clear acceptable use guidelines for all employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Weak Authentication for Computer Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for employees to log into their computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication. This was identified from the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on computer login.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Internal network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Weak Authentication for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if user credentials are compromised, as attackers only need a single factor to gain entry. This was identified from the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on sensitive data systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Databases containing sensitive data</li><li>File servers storing confidential information</li><li>Cloud storage for critical business data</li><li>Applications handling PII/PHI</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy (AUP). Without an AUP, employees may not be fully aware of their responsibilities regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, data handling procedures, and internet usage. This absence can lead to increased risks of security incidents, data breaches, and potential compliance violations due to inconsistent or inappropriate employee behavior. This was identified from the organizational data indicating 'No' for an AUP.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT infrastructure</li><li>Organizational data assets</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Recurring Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive initial security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual or regular security awareness training for all employees. This means that existing employees may not be updated on the latest cybersecurity threats, evolving best practices, or changes in company policies, thereby increasing the likelihood of successful phishing attacks, social engineering attempts, or other human-factor vulnerabilities. This was identified from the organizational data indicating 'No' for annual training for all employees.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Email systems</li><li>Internal applications</li><li>Organizational data</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and, critically, for access to all sensitive data systems. This will significantly enhance authentication security and reduce the impact of compromised credentials. Furthermore, the organization should develop and formally implement a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) to clearly define expectations for IT resource usage and data handling, ensuring all employees are aware of their responsibilities. Finally, a robust program for recurring, at least annual, security awareness training for all employees should be established to keep staff informed about current threats and best practices, thereby strengthening the human firewall against cyberattacks.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently exhibits a mixed security posture. While some foundational elements like MFA for email and initial new hire training are in place, significant vulnerabilities exist due to the lack of MFA for computer and sensitive data system access, the absence of a formal acceptable use policy, and insufficient recurring security awareness training for all staff. Addressing these critical gaps is essential to enhance the overall security readiness and protect against common cyber threats.</p>
