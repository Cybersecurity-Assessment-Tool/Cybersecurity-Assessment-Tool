        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization operates an Nginx web server on port 443 (HTTPS), indicating a public-facing web presence. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for email and sensitive data systems, it is notably absent for computer logins. The organization has an acceptable use policy and provides security awareness training for new employees, but lacks annual security awareness training for all staff.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee workstations and the internal network if credentials are compromised through phishing, keylogging, or other attack vectors. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker direct access to internal resources, leading to potential data breaches, malware propagation, and lateral movement within the network. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Internal network</li><li>User accounts</li><li>Sensitive data on local machines</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This creates a gap in ongoing education, leaving staff vulnerable to evolving cyber threats such as new phishing techniques, social engineering tactics, and malware trends. A lack of regular reinforcement can lead to a decline in security best practices, increasing the likelihood of human error contributing to security incidents, data loss, or system compromise. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network security</li><li>Incident response capabilities</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization implements Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to significantly enhance workstation and network security. Additionally, a mandatory annual security awareness training program should be established for all employees to ensure continuous education on current threats and best practices. Furthermore, regular patching and updates for the Nginx web server (currently version 1.18.0) should be performed to address any known vulnerabilities and maintain a secure public-facing presence.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security with MFA for critical systems and initial employee training. However, the absence of MFA for computer logins and a comprehensive annual security awareness program for all employees represent significant vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. Addressing these gaps is crucial for enhancing the overall security posture, reducing the risk of unauthorized access, and fostering a more resilient cybersecurity environment.</p>
