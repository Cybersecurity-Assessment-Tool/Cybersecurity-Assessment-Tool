        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open SSH port (22), indicating potential remote access capabilities. While some critical areas like email and sensitive data systems are protected by Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), a significant gap exists as MFA is not required for computer logins. Furthermore, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees, which introduces considerable human-factor risks and potential for inconsistent security practices.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH (port 22) service was detected on the network perimeter. While SSH is a legitimate service for secure remote access, if not properly secured (e.g., strong authentication, disabled password login, rate limiting, up-to-date software), it can be a target for brute-force attacks or exploitation of vulnerabilities in the SSH daemon. Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized remote access to internal systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 22</li><li>Network perimeter</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Authentication for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to internal systems if an attacker compromises user credentials through phishing, malware, or other means. Without a second factor, stolen passwords provide direct access to employee workstations and potentially the internal network.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers</li><li>Internal network access</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an established employee acceptable use policy. This absence means there are no clear, documented guidelines for employees regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, internet access, and data handling. This can lead to inconsistent security practices, increased risk of data breaches, malware infections, and compliance issues due to unmanaged employee behavior.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>IT systems</li><li>Data handling processes</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. While new employees receive initial training, the lack of recurring training means existing employees may not be updated on evolving cyber threats, new company policies, or best practices for identifying and responding to security incidents (e.g., phishing, social engineering). This increases the human element risk in the organization's security posture.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is recommended to immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised. For the open SSH port, ensure robust security configurations are in place, including disabling password authentication in favor of SSH keys, implementing rate limiting, and regularly patching the SSH daemon. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to clearly define expectations for IT resource usage and data handling. Furthermore, establish and conduct mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees to ensure they are continuously educated on current cyber threats and best security practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing MFA for email and sensitive data systems. However, significant vulnerabilities exist, particularly with the lack of MFA for computer logins, an open SSH port requiring hardening, and critical gaps in security policies and training. The absence of an acceptable use policy and annual security awareness training for all employees leaves the organization susceptible to human-factor risks and inconsistent security practices. Addressing these areas is crucial for improving the overall security posture and readiness against evolving cyber threats.</p>
