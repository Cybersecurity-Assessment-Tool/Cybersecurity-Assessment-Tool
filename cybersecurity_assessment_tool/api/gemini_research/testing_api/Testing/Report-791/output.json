            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network scan revealed an open SSH port (22), indicating potential exposure if not adequately secured. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for email and sensitive data systems, it is notably absent for computer logins, presenting a significant vulnerability. Furthermore, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not provide security awareness training for new employees, although annual training is conducted for all staff. A critical internal service exposure was also identified, posing an immediate and severe risk to the organization's security posture.",

                        "Risk": "Critical Internal Service Exposure",
                        "Overview": "A critical vulnerability was identified where an internal service, typically bound to localhost, is exposed to the network, potentially allowing external access. This exposure, indicated by a CVSS score of 10.0, suggests that an attacker could gain complete control over the affected system or access sensitive data without authentication. The exact nature of the exposed service requires further investigation, but its critical severity implies immediate and severe impact.",

                        "Overview": "An open SSH port (22) was detected, indicating that the Secure Shell service is accessible from the network. If not adequately secured with strong authentication, rate limiting, and regular patching, this service can be exploited for unauthorized access, brute-force attacks, or remote code execution.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Computer Login",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication.",

                        "Risk": "Absence of Acceptable Use Policy",
                        "Overview": "The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This absence means there are no formal guidelines for employees regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, potentially leading to misuse, data breaches, or compliance violations due to unmanaged employee behavior.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Insufficient New Employee Security Training",
                        "Overview": "New employees do not receive security awareness training upon onboarding. This leaves new hires vulnerable to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) and unaware of critical security protocols, increasing the risk of human error-induced security incidents during their initial employment period.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is imperative to immediately identify and secure the critically exposed internal service by implementing strict firewall rules. For the exposed SSH service, adopt robust security practices including disabling password authentication, utilizing key-based authentication with strong passphrases, implementing rate limiting, and considering a non-standard port or VPN for access. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to significantly enhance credential protection. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to guide appropriate IT resource usage. Furthermore, establish mandatory security awareness training for all new employees during their onboarding process to instill best practices from day one. Continue with the annual security awareness training for all employees.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces several significant security vulnerabilities, including a critical internal service exposure, an open SSH port, and a lack of MFA for computer logins. Additionally, the absence of an acceptable use policy and new employee security training indicates gaps in foundational security practices. While annual security training is commendable, these identified weaknesses collectively lower the organization's overall security readiness and increase its susceptibility to various cyber threats. Immediate action on the critical and high-severity risks is essential to improve the security posture."
