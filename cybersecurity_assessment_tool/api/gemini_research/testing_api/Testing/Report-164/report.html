        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open HTTP port (80), indicating unencrypted web traffic. Furthermore, the organizational data indicates significant gaps in authentication and policy enforcement. Specifically, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for email access or computer logins, although it is used for sensitive data systems. There is no employee acceptable use policy in place, and new employees do not receive security awareness training, despite annual training being provided for all existing employees. These findings suggest a moderate to high-risk security posture, particularly concerning authentication and foundational security policies.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unencrypted Web Traffic (HTTP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Port 80 (HTTP) is open, indicating a web server is running without encryption. This exposes traffic to eavesdropping, potential data interception, and man-in-the-middle attacks, compromising data confidentiality. This was identified via an Nmap scan.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li><li>Web Server</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing, as a single compromised password can grant full access to an employee's email, potentially leading to business email compromise (BEC) and data exfiltration.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if passwords are stolen or guessed, potentially leading to lateral movement within the network, installation of malware, and data exfiltration.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network access</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This means there are no formal guidelines for employees regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, internet, and email, increasing the risk of misuse, data breaches, non-compliance with security best practices, and legal liabilities.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>IT systems</li><li>Organizational policy framework</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training upon joining the organization. This leaves them susceptible to social engineering attacks (phishing, vishing, smishing) and unaware of critical security protocols from day one, making them potential entry points for attackers and increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and computer logins to significantly enhance credential security. All web services operating on port 80 should be migrated to HTTPS (port 443) to ensure encrypted communication and protect data in transit. The organization must develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to guide appropriate IT resource usage. Additionally, mandatory security awareness training should be introduced for all new employees during their onboarding process to ensure they are equipped with essential security knowledge from day one. Continuing the annual security awareness training for all employees is also crucial.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In conclusion, the organization currently faces several critical and medium-severity vulnerabilities primarily related to weak authentication mechanisms, unencrypted web services, and a lack of foundational security policies and initial employee training. While annual security awareness training is in place, the absence of MFA for key access points and an AUP, coupled with the exposure of unencrypted web traffic, indicates a moderate level of security readiness. Addressing these areas is paramount to strengthening the overall security posture and reducing the attack surface.</p>
