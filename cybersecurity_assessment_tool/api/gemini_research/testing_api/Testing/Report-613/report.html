        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization operates a network with an Nginx web server on port 443. While strong security practices are in place for email and sensitive data systems, including MFA and regular security awareness training, a critical gap exists in endpoint security.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Web Server Software - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nginx web server running on port 443 is identified as version 1.18.0. This version is significantly outdated, with the latest stable release being much newer. Older software versions often contain known security vulnerabilities that have been patched in subsequent releases. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to various impacts, including denial-of-service, information disclosure, or remote code execution, compromising the web server and potentially other connected systems. This was identified via an Nmap scan revealing the specific Nginx version.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Nginx web server (version 1.18.0) on port 443</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee workstations and the internal network. If an attacker obtains an employee's username and password through phishing, malware, or other means, they can gain direct access to the computer without an additional authentication factor. This could lead to data breaches, lateral movement within the network, and system compromise. This was identified through the organizational data indicating "Do you require MFA to log into computers?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers/endpoints requiring login</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately update the Nginx web server to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities and improve overall security posture. Furthermore, implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins is crucial. This will add an essential layer of security, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access even if primary credentials are compromised. Regular vulnerability scanning and patch management processes should also be established or reinforced for all network infrastructure.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a good foundation in security awareness and MFA for critical systems like email and sensitive data. However, the presence of an outdated Nginx web server and the absence of MFA for computer logins represent significant vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. Addressing these high-severity risks by updating software and implementing MFA for endpoints is paramount to enhancing the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and protecting against potential breaches.</p>
