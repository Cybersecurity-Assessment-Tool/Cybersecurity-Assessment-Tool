        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates strong foundational security practices regarding multi-factor authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. This significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials. However, critical gaps exist in human-centric security controls. Specifically, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or provide annual training for all employees. The network scan data indicates no open ports were found on the scanned target, suggesting a potentially hardened external perimeter, though the scope of this scan is limited.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The absence of an employee acceptable use policy means there are no formal guidelines for employees regarding the proper use of company assets, data, and IT systems. This increases the risk of misuse of company resources, accidental data exposure, and non-compliance with industry regulations. Without clear rules, employees may unknowingly engage in activities that compromise security. This vulnerability was identified through direct organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company data</li><li>IT systems</li><li>Network resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees are often prime targets for social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) as they may not be familiar with the organization's specific security protocols, common threats, or reporting procedures. The lack of initial security awareness training leaves them highly vulnerable, increasing the likelihood of successful attacks that could lead to credential compromise, malware infection, or data breaches. This vulnerability was identified through direct organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Company email systems</li><li>Internal networks</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Cyber threats are constantly evolving, and without regular, at least annual, security awareness training, employees' knowledge and vigilance can degrade over time. This makes the entire workforce more susceptible to sophisticated phishing campaigns, ransomware, social engineering, and other emerging threats. A lack of ongoing education significantly increases the risk of human error leading to security incidents and data breaches. This vulnerability was identified through direct organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company email systems</li><li>Internal networks</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Organizational reputation</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy, clearly outlining expectations for the use of company resources and data. Furthermore, a mandatory security awareness training program should be established, including initial training for all new hires and annual refresher training for all existing employees. This training should cover topics such as phishing recognition, password hygiene, data handling best practices, and incident reporting procedures. While the network scan showed no open ports, regular, more in-depth vulnerability scanning and penetration testing should be conducted to ensure the external perimeter remains secure and to identify any internal network weaknesses.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization has a commendable stance on multi-factor authentication, which is a critical control for identity and access management. However, its overall security readiness is significantly hampered by the absence of fundamental human-centric security controls. The lack of an acceptable use policy and comprehensive security awareness training for both new and existing employees creates substantial vulnerabilities that could be exploited through social engineering or accidental misuse, despite strong technical controls like MFA. Addressing these policy and training gaps is paramount to building a robust and resilient cybersecurity posture.</p>
