        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization operates a network with at least one active host exposing an HTTPS service via Nginx 1.18.0 on port 443. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for email access, it is notably absent for computer logins and sensitive data systems. The organization has an acceptable use policy and provides security awareness training for new employees, but lacks annual refresher training for all staff.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Without MFA, compromised credentials (e.g., via phishing) can lead to unauthorized access to employee workstations, potentially allowing lateral movement within the network and access to internal resources. This increases the risk of data breaches and system compromise.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Critical systems containing sensitive data are vulnerable to unauthorized access if only a single factor (e.g., password) is required. A compromised password could grant an attacker full access to confidential information, leading to severe data breaches, regulatory fines, and reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>Cloud storage</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive training, the lack of annual refresher training for all employees means that evolving threats (e.g., new phishing techniques, social engineering tactics) may not be adequately addressed. This can lead to a decline in security posture over time, increasing the likelihood of human-factor incidents.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Use of End-of-Life (EOL) Web Server Software - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization is running Nginx 1.18.0, which is an End-of-Life (EOL) version. EOL software no longer receives security patches or updates from the vendor, making it highly susceptible to newly discovered vulnerabilities. This significantly increases the risk of exploitation by attackers, potentially leading to web server compromise, data exfiltration, or denial of service.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Web server (nginx 1.18.0)</li><li>Port 443</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and, critically, for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access from compromised credentials. The Nginx web server running version 1.18.0 should be immediately upgraded to a currently supported and patched version to mitigate risks associated with unaddressed vulnerabilities in EOL software. Furthermore, a comprehensive annual security awareness training program should be established for all employees to ensure continuous education on evolving cyber threats and best practices. Regular vulnerability scanning and patch management processes should also be implemented for all network assets.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant security risks primarily due to the lack of MFA for critical access points (computer logins and sensitive data systems), the use of End-of-Life web server software, and insufficient ongoing security awareness training for its workforce. While some foundational security practices are in place, these identified gaps leave the organization vulnerable to credential-based attacks, exploitation of known software vulnerabilities, and human-factor errors. Addressing these areas is crucial for improving overall readiness against modern cyber threats and protecting sensitive assets.</p>
