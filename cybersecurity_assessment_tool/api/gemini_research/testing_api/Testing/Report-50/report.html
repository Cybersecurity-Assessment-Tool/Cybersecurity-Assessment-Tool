        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network infrastructure includes an FTP service (vsftpd 2.3.4) with anonymous login enabled, posing a significant security risk. From an organizational policy standpoint, while MFA is used for email access, it is notably absent for computer logins and sensitive data systems. Critical security policies, such as an employee acceptable use policy, are not in place, and there is a complete lack of security awareness training for both new and existing employees, indicating a low level of preparedness against common cyber threats. Additionally, several workstations are running an outdated and unsupported operating system.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Anonymous FTP Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The FTP service (vsftpd 2.3.4) on port 21 is configured to allow anonymous login. This permits unauthorized users to access and potentially modify or exfiltrate files without authentication, leading to data breaches or system compromise. Identified via Nmap's ftp-anon script.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>FTP Service (vsftpd 2.3.4)</li><li>Port 21</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised, as a single factor (password) is the only barrier. Identified from organizational policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee Workstations</li><li>Network Login Systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if user credentials are compromised, potentially leading to severe data breaches and regulatory non-compliance. Identified from organizational policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive Data Systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>File Servers</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This absence means there are no clear guidelines for employees regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, increasing the risk of misuse, accidental data exposure, and non-compliance with security best practices. Identified from organizational policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All Employees</li><li>IT Resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training. This leaves new hires unprepared for common cyber threats like phishing, social engineering, and malware, making them potential entry points for attackers. Identified from organizational policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New Employees</li><li>Organizational Security Posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. This results in outdated knowledge regarding evolving cyber threats and best practices, increasing the overall human factor risk across the organization. Identified from organizational policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All Employees</li><li>Organizational Security Posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Windows Policy - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Computers are running Windows 7, an operating system that has reached its end-of-life and no longer receives security updates from Microsoft. This exposes workstations to known and unpatched vulnerabilities, making them highly susceptible to exploitation and compromise. Identified from current risks data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is imperative to immediately disable anonymous FTP access and, if FTP functionality is still required, transition to secure protocols like SFTP or FTPS with robust authentication. The organization must implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and access to sensitive data systems to significantly enhance credential security. Furthermore, developing and enforcing a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy is crucial for establishing clear guidelines for IT resource usage. Mandatory security awareness training should be introduced for all new employees and conducted annually for all staff to educate them on evolving cyber threats and best practices. Finally, all workstations running Windows 7 must be upgraded to a currently supported operating system, such as Windows 10 or 11, to ensure ongoing security patching and protection against known vulnerabilities. A long-term strategy for hardware refresh should be considered if current machines are incompatible with modern OS requirements.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks stemming from both technical vulnerabilities and a lack of foundational security policies and training. The presence of anonymous FTP access and outdated operating systems creates immediate technical exposure, while the absence of MFA for critical systems, an acceptable use policy, and comprehensive security awareness training leaves the organization highly susceptible to human-factor exploits and data breaches. Addressing these issues is critical for improving the overall security posture and readiness against cyber threats.</p>
