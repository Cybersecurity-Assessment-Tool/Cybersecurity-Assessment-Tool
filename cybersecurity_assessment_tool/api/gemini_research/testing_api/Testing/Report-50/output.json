                "Summary": "The organization's network infrastructure includes an FTP service (vsftpd 2.3.4) with anonymous login enabled, posing a significant security risk. From an organizational policy standpoint, while MFA is used for email access, it is notably absent for computer logins and sensitive data systems. Critical security policies, such as an employee acceptable use policy, are not in place, and there is a complete lack of security awareness training for both new and existing employees, indicating a low level of preparedness against common cyber threats. Additionally, several workstations are running an outdated and unsupported operating system.",

                        "Risk": "Outdated Windows Policy",
                        "Overview": "Computers are running Windows 7, an operating system that has reached its end-of-life and no longer receives security updates from Microsoft. This exposes workstations to known and unpatched vulnerabilities, making them highly susceptible to exploitation and compromise. Identified from current risks data.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is imperative to immediately disable anonymous FTP access and, if FTP functionality is still required, transition to secure protocols like SFTP or FTPS with robust authentication. The organization must implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and access to sensitive data systems to significantly enhance credential security. Furthermore, developing and enforcing a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy is crucial for establishing clear guidelines for IT resource usage. Mandatory security awareness training should be introduced for all new employees and conducted annually for all staff to educate them on evolving cyber threats and best practices. Finally, all workstations running Windows 7 must be upgraded to a currently supported operating system, such as Windows 10 or 11, to ensure ongoing security patching and protection against known vulnerabilities. A long-term strategy for hardware refresh should be considered if current machines are incompatible with modern OS requirements.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks stemming from both technical vulnerabilities and a lack of foundational security policies and training. The presence of anonymous FTP access and outdated operating systems creates immediate technical exposure, while the absence of MFA for critical systems, an acceptable use policy, and comprehensive security awareness training leaves the organization highly susceptible to human-factor exploits and data breaches. Addressing these issues is critical for improving the overall security posture and readiness against cyber threats."
