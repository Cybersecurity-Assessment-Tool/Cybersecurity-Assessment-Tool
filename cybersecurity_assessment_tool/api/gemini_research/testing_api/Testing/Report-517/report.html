        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization operates a web server running Nginx 1.18.0 on port 443 (HTTPS). While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for email and computer logins, it is notably absent for sensitive data systems. The organization has an acceptable use policy in place and conducts annual security awareness training for all employees, but new employees do not receive initial security awareness training.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Web Server Software - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nginx web server identified on port 443 is running version 1.18.0. While this version is stable, it is an older release. Running outdated software can expose the organization to known vulnerabilities that have been patched in newer versions, potentially allowing attackers to exploit these weaknesses for unauthorized access or service disruption. This was identified through network scanning.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Nginx 1.18.0 web server</li><li>Port 443</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly elevates the risk of unauthorized access. If an attacker compromises user credentials through phishing, malware, or other means, they could gain full access to critical data without an additional layer of security. This was identified from the organizational survey data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User authentication processes</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not provide security awareness training for new employees upon onboarding. This leaves new hires susceptible to social engineering attacks, phishing, and other common cybersecurity threats from their first day. A lack of initial training can lead to inadvertent security breaches due to human error, weakening the overall security posture. This was identified from the organizational survey data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li><li>Employee onboarding process</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To enhance the organization's security posture, it is recommended to immediately update the Nginx web server to the latest stable version to mitigate known vulnerabilities. Crucially, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be implemented for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised. Furthermore, a comprehensive security awareness training program should be introduced for all new employees during their onboarding process to ensure they are equipped with essential cybersecurity knowledge from day one.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security with MFA for email and computer logins, and annual security awareness training. However, critical gaps exist, particularly the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems and initial security training for new hires. The use of an older web server version also presents a potential attack vector. Addressing these vulnerabilities is essential to significantly improve the organization's readiness against modern cyber threats and protect its sensitive assets.</p>
