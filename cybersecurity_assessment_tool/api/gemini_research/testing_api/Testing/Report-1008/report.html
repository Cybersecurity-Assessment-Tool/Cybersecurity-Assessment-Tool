        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of access control by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins. However, significant gaps exist in securing sensitive data systems, establishing clear employee conduct guidelines, and fostering a security-aware culture through regular training. The absence of these critical controls leaves the organization vulnerable to various threats, including unauthorized data access, misuse of IT resources, and social engineering attacks.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Access Control for Sensitive Data - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or other means. Without MFA, a single compromised password can lead to a data breach, impacting data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. This vulnerability was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. This means there are no clear guidelines or rules for how employees should use company IT resources, including networks, devices, and data. The absence of an AUP can lead to misuse of company assets, increased exposure to malware, data leakage, and potential non-compliance with industry regulations, as employees may unknowingly engage in risky behaviors. This vulnerability was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees, nor does it provide annual training for all employees. This leaves the workforce susceptible to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting), malware, and other human-centric threats. Employees who are not regularly educated on cybersecurity best practices are more likely to fall victim to attacks, inadvertently compromising the organization's security posture and potentially leading to data breaches or system compromises. This vulnerability was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Email systems</li><li>Network access points</li><li>Data handling processes</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication for all sensitive data systems to enhance access control. Furthermore, a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy should be developed, communicated, and enforced to establish clear guidelines for IT resource usage. Finally, a robust security awareness training program must be established, including mandatory training for all new hires and annual refresher courses for all employees, to cultivate a security-conscious workforce and reduce human-factor vulnerabilities.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has implemented MFA for basic access points like email and computer logins, its overall cybersecurity readiness is significantly hampered by critical deficiencies. The lack of MFA for sensitive data, the absence of an acceptable use policy, and the complete omission of security awareness training expose the organization to substantial risks. Addressing these fundamental gaps is crucial for improving the security posture and protecting against potential data breaches and operational disruptions.</p>
