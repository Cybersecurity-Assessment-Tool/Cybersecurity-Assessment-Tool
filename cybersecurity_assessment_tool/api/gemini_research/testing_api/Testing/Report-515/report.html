        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open SSH port (22) on an active host. Review of organizational data indicates significant gaps in security posture, including the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and computer logins. Furthermore, the organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or provide annual training for all employees. While an acceptable use policy is in place and MFA is utilized for sensitive data systems, these critical deficiencies expose the organization to substantial risk.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A critical vulnerability was identified where a service or interface intended for local access (localhost) appears to be exposed externally. This exposure, with a CVSS score of 10.0, indicates that an attacker could potentially bypass security controls, gain unauthorized access to internal systems, or exploit services not designed for external exposure. This could lead to full system compromise, data exfiltration, or other severe impacts. The vulnerability was identified through network scanning activities.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately investigate the 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability. This includes identifying the specific service, restricting its external access through firewall rules, and removing it if not essential. For the open SSH port, ensure it is secured with strong authentication (e.g., SSH keys, disabled password authentication), rate limiting, and disabled root login. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and computer logins to significantly enhance authentication security. Furthermore, establish a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees and conduct annual refresher training for all staff to educate them on common threats and best security practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces critical vulnerabilities, notably an exposed localhost service and an open SSH port, alongside significant gaps in fundamental security practices such as the lack of MFA for email and computer logins, and the absence of regular security awareness training. While an acceptable use policy and MFA for sensitive data systems are positive aspects, the overall readiness is low due to these critical findings. Addressing these vulnerabilities and implementing the recommended security controls is paramount to improving the organization's cybersecurity posture and reducing its attack surface.</p>
