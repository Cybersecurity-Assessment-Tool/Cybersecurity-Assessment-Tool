        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Based on the provided organizational data, the organization demonstrates a commitment to security awareness training for all employees, including new hires, and implements Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems. However, there are notable gaps in security posture related to endpoint access control and employee policy enforcement. No network scan data or specific technical vulnerabilities were provided, so the assessment focuses on policy and access control aspects.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to internal systems if credentials are compromised through phishing, malware, or brute-force attacks. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's workstation and potentially the internal network. This was identified through the organizational data indicating "Do you require MFA to log into computers?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee workstations</li><li>Internal network access points</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). An AUP is crucial for defining acceptable and unacceptable use of company IT resources, data, and internet access. Without clear guidelines, employees may inadvertently engage in activities that introduce security risks (e.g., visiting malicious websites, installing unauthorized software, mishandling sensitive data) or violate compliance requirements. This absence can lead to increased exposure to malware, data breaches, and legal liabilities. This was identified through the organizational data indicating "Does your organization have an employee acceptable use policy?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources (computers, network, software)</li><li>Sensitive data</li><li>Organizational reputation</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins. This critical step will significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials. Furthermore, the organization should develop and formally implement a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). This policy should clearly outline expectations for employee conduct regarding IT resource usage, data handling, and internet access, and be communicated to all staff. Regular reviews and updates of this policy are also advised to ensure its continued relevance and effectiveness.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a good foundation in security awareness training and the use of MFA for email and sensitive data systems. However, the absence of MFA for computer logins and a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy represents significant vulnerabilities that could lead to unauthorized system access and increased operational risks. Addressing these gaps is crucial for strengthening the overall security posture and reducing the likelihood of successful cyberattacks and internal policy violations.</p>
