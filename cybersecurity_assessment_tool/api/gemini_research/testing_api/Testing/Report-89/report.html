        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization exhibits a mixed security posture. While strong practices such as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems, along with annual security awareness training for all employees, are in place, critical vulnerabilities and gaps were identified. A network scan revealed an open Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) port (3389), indicating potential external exposure. Furthermore, MFA is not mandated for computer logins, and new employees do not receive security awareness training upon onboarding, leaving significant areas for improvement in the organization's overall security readiness.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>RDP Exposure - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed externally on port 3389, allowing potential attackers to attempt brute-force attacks or exploit RDP vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to internal systems. This critical vulnerability was identified through a network scan.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are compromised, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication. This policy gap was identified through organizational data review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers</li><li>Login systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training upon onboarding. This leaves them vulnerable to social engineering attacks, phishing, and other common threats from day one, potentially introducing risks to the organization before they understand security best practices. This policy gap was identified through organizational data review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational data and systems (via human error)</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately close the externally exposed RDP port (3389) or place it behind a robust VPN solution for secure access. For long-term security, ensure all remote access is channeled through a secure VPN. Furthermore, enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to significantly enhance protection against credential theft. It is also crucial to establish a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees during their onboarding process to ensure they are equipped with essential cybersecurity knowledge from the start. Regularly review and update the acceptable use policy and continue the existing annual security awareness training for all employees.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces critical and high-severity vulnerabilities, primarily due to an exposed RDP service and the absence of MFA for computer logins. While some foundational security practices are in place, such as MFA for sensitive systems and annual security training, the identified gaps in new employee training and critical system access controls significantly diminish the overall security readiness. Addressing these issues promptly is paramount to reduce the attack surface, enhance resilience against cyber threats, and improve the organization's overall cybersecurity posture.</p>
