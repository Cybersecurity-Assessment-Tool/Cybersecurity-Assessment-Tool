        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates some foundational security practices, including Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and an acceptable use policy. New employees also receive security awareness training. However, critical gaps exist in the implementation of MFA for email and sensitive data systems, which are significant risk areas. Furthermore, the organization lacks annual security awareness training for all employees, potentially leaving the workforce vulnerable to evolving threats. A network scan identified an Nginx web server running version 1.18.0 on port 443, which is an outdated version and may contain known vulnerabilities.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for email access. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts, which can lead to phishing attacks, business email compromise (BEC), and data breaches. Compromised email accounts can be used to impersonate employees, send malicious links, or gain access to other systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA to access sensitive data systems. This exposes critical data to a higher risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised. A single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to sensitive information, leading to severe data breaches, regulatory fines, and reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>File shares</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual training for all employees. This means employees may not be up-to-date on the latest threats, best practices, or company policies, increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents (e.g., falling for phishing, poor password hygiene, mishandling sensitive information).</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Web Server Software - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nginx web server is running version 1.18.0. As of late 2025, Nginx 1.18.0 is an older stable version (released in April 2020) and is likely to have known vulnerabilities that have been patched in newer versions. Running outdated software increases the risk of exploitation by attackers who can leverage publicly known vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access, disrupt services, or inject malicious content.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Web server (Nginx 1.18.0)</li><li>Port 443</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and sensitive data systems. This will significantly enhance protection against credential theft and unauthorized access. Furthermore, a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees should be established to ensure the workforce remains informed about current threats and best practices. The Nginx web server should be upgraded to the latest stable version to address known vulnerabilities and a regular patching schedule should be implemented for all software and systems. A comprehensive vulnerability management program should be considered to proactively identify and remediate security weaknesses.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization exhibits a mixed security posture. While some positive security controls are in place, critical vulnerabilities related to the absence of MFA for email and sensitive data, outdated software, and insufficient ongoing security awareness training pose significant risks. Addressing these high-severity issues promptly is crucial to bolstering the organization's defense against cyber threats and improving its overall cybersecurity readiness.</p>
