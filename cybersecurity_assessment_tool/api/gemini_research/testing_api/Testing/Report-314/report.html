        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently utilizes an FTP server running vsftpd version 2.3.4, which allows anonymous login, posing a significant security risk. Internally, while Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required for computer logins and sensitive data systems, it is notably absent for email access. The organization has an acceptable use policy and provides security awareness training for new employees, but lacks annual training for all staff. Furthermore, a critical vulnerability exists with workstations running an outdated Windows 7 operating system, which is no longer supported with security updates.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Anonymous FTP Access & Outdated Software - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The FTP server (vsftpd 2.3.4) is configured to allow anonymous login, which can lead to unauthorized access to files, data leakage, or even server compromise if write permissions are misconfigured. Additionally, vsftpd 2.3.4 is an outdated version with known vulnerabilities, increasing the attack surface. This was identified through a network scan showing an open port 21 with anonymous FTP login allowed.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>FTP Server (vsftpd 2.3.4)</li><li>Port 21</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks, as a stolen password alone would grant an attacker full access to an employee's email, potentially leading to further internal system access or data exfiltration. This was identified from the organization's security policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee email accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, there is no mandatory annual training for all employees. This leaves the organization vulnerable to evolving cyber threats, as employees may not be updated on the latest phishing techniques, social engineering tactics, or changes in internal security policies, increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents. This was identified from the organization's security policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Windows Operating System - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Several computers within the organization are running Windows 7, an operating system that has reached its end-of-life. This means it no longer receives security updates, patches, or technical support from Microsoft, making these systems highly vulnerable to known exploits, malware, and zero-day attacks. This significantly increases the risk of system compromise and data breaches. This was identified from the current risks data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations running Windows 7</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately disable anonymous FTP access and upgrade the vsftpd server to a current, supported version, or consider migrating to a more secure file transfer protocol like SFTP or FTPS. Implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts is crucial to significantly enhance protection against credential theft. The organization should also establish and enforce a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees to ensure they are continuously educated on the latest cyber threats and best practices. Most critically, all workstations running Windows 7 must be upgraded to a currently supported operating system, such as Windows 10 or 11, to ensure they receive vital security updates and patches.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization faces several significant cybersecurity vulnerabilities, ranging from outdated software and insecure configurations on its network perimeter to critical gaps in internal security policies and workstation operating systems. The lack of MFA for email and the presence of end-of-life Windows 7 machines represent immediate and high-priority risks that could lead to severe security incidents. While some foundational security practices are in place, the overall readiness is compromised by these critical weaknesses, necessitating prompt and comprehensive remediation efforts to bolster the organization's security posture.</p>
