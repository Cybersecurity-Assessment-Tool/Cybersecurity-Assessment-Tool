        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan indicates that port 80 is closed. However, a specific vulnerability assessment identified an 'Unencrypted Web Server' risk, stating that port 80 is open. The organization currently lacks multi-factor authentication for email and computer logins, and does not have an employee acceptable use policy or regular security awareness training. While MFA is used for sensitive data systems, these other areas represent significant security gaps that increase the overall risk posture.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unencrypted Web Server - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Port 80 is open, indicating a potential unencrypted web server. This allows for unencrypted communication, making data vulnerable to interception and eavesdropping. The impact could be exposure of sensitive information transmitted over the network. This was identified through a vulnerability assessment.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts, which can lead to phishing attacks, business email compromise, and data breaches. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This makes systems vulnerable to credential stuffing, brute-force attacks, and unauthorized access if primary credentials are compromised. The impact could be unauthorized access to internal networks and sensitive data. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines, employees may engage in activities that introduce security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling company data. This increases the likelihood of malware infections, data leakage, and compliance violations. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or annual training for all employees. This leaves employees susceptible to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting), malware, and other human-factor vulnerabilities. A lack of training significantly increases the risk of successful cyberattacks due to human error. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network security</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is recommended to immediately close port 80 if it is indeed open, and implement SSL/TLS for any web services. Crucially, the organization must implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and computer logins to significantly enhance access security. A comprehensive employee acceptable use policy should be developed and enforced to guide appropriate technology usage. Furthermore, mandatory security awareness training for all new employees and annual refresher training for all staff are essential to build a strong human firewall against social engineering and other threats. Regular review and update of security policies and procedures are also advised.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to a lack of fundamental security controls and policies. While MFA is in place for sensitive data systems, the absence of MFA for email and computer logins, coupled with a lack of security awareness training and an acceptable use policy, creates a broad attack surface. Addressing these foundational issues is critical to improving the overall security posture and readiness against common cyber threats. The identified 'Unencrypted Web Server' vulnerability, if confirmed, further highlights the need for a thorough network security review.</p>
