        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization currently utilizes Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems, which is a positive security measure. However, a network scan revealed an open Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) port (3389), indicating a potential external attack vector. Furthermore, critical gaps exist in the organization's security posture, including the absence of MFA for computer logins, a lack of an employee acceptable use policy, and no formal security awareness training for new or existing employees. These deficiencies expose the organization to significant risks related to unauthorized access, data misuse, and social engineering attacks.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>RDP Exposure - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nmap scan identified an open Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) port (3389) on an external-facing IP address. RDP, when exposed directly to the internet, is a frequent target for brute-force attacks and exploitation of known vulnerabilities, potentially leading to unauthorized access to internal systems. This was identified via network scanning.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP address with open port 3389</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This means that if an employee's username and password are compromised (e.g., through phishing or credential stuffing), an attacker can gain direct access to the employee's workstation and potentially the internal network without an additional layer of security. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access and lateral movement within the network. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers</li><li>Internal network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines on the appropriate use of company IT resources, employees may inadvertently engage in activities that introduce security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive data. This can lead to data breaches, malware infections, and legal liabilities. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company data</li><li>Network resources</li><li>IT infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or annually for all employees. This leaves the workforce vulnerable to social engineering attacks, phishing campaigns, and other human-centric threats. Employees who are not trained to recognize and report suspicious activities are more likely to fall victim to these attacks, potentially leading to credential compromise, malware infections, and data loss. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company data</li><li>Network security</li><li>Incident response capabilities</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, the following recommendations are provided: 1. RDP Exposure: Immediately close port 3389 to external access. For legitimate remote access needs, implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution that requires strong authentication (preferably MFA) before users can connect to internal resources, including RDP. 2. MFA for Computer Login: Implement mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins across the organization. This adds a critical layer of security, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access even if credentials are stolen. 3. Employee Acceptable Use Policy: Develop and formally implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy. This policy should clearly define expectations for the use of company IT assets, data handling, internet usage, and security best practices. Ensure all employees acknowledge and understand this policy. 4. Security Awareness Training: Establish and implement a mandatory security awareness training program. This program should include initial training for all new hires and annual refresher training for all employees, covering topics such as phishing, social engineering, password hygiene, and data handling best practices. Regular training will empower employees to be the first line of defense against cyber threats.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing MFA for email and sensitive data systems. However, the presence of an externally exposed RDP port, coupled with significant gaps in foundational security practices such as MFA for computer logins, an acceptable use policy, and security awareness training, indicates a moderate to high overall risk posture. Addressing these vulnerabilities, particularly the critical RDP exposure and the human element risks, is paramount to enhancing the organization's resilience against cyber threats and preventing potential data breaches or system compromises. Proactive implementation of the recommended security controls will significantly improve the organization's readiness and reduce its attack surface.</p>
