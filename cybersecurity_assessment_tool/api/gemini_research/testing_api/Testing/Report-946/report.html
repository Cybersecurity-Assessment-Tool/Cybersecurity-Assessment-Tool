        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network infrastructure details were not provided for a technical scan. However, an assessment of organizational policies and practices reveals significant gaps in foundational cybersecurity controls. The primary areas of concern revolve around the absence of multi-factor authentication (MFA) across critical access points and a lack of essential security policies and training for new employees. While annual security awareness training is conducted, the absence of initial training for new hires and a formal acceptable use policy creates substantial risk.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks. Compromised email accounts can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and further network penetration. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email access systems</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are stolen or guessed. A compromised computer can serve as an entry point for lateral movement within the network, malware deployment, and access to sensitive data. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network access points</li><li>Domain controllers</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk to the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information. Without MFA, a single compromised credential can grant an attacker full access to critical data, potentially leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and severe reputational damage. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data repositories</li><li>Database servers</li><li>Cloud storage</li><li>CRM/ERP systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without a formal policy, employees may be unaware of their responsibilities regarding company assets, data handling, internet usage, and security best practices. This can lead to unintentional security incidents, misuse of company resources, and increased legal and compliance risks. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company devices</li><li>Network resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering attacks due to their unfamiliarity with company policies and security protocols. This gap leaves the organization vulnerable to phishing, malware, and other human-factor attacks from the moment a new employee joins. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Onboarding process</li><li>Overall security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. This is a foundational security control that significantly reduces the risk of credential-based attacks. Furthermore, a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy must be developed and formally implemented, clearly outlining expectations for secure behavior and resource usage. Crucially, a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees should be established as part of the onboarding process to ensure they are equipped with essential security knowledge from day one. While annual training is positive, it must be complemented by initial training for new hires to close this critical gap. Regular reviews and updates of these policies and training materials are also advised to adapt to evolving threat landscapes.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to the absence of critical foundational controls. The lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, combined with the absence of an acceptable use policy and initial security awareness training for new employees, creates a highly vulnerable environment. While annual security awareness training is a positive step, these fundamental gaps leave the organization susceptible to various attacks, including data breaches, unauthorized access, and social engineering. Addressing these policy and control deficiencies is paramount to improving the overall security posture and readiness against modern cyber threats.</p>
