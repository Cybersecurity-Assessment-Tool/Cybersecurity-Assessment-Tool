            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization exhibits a mixed security posture. Positive aspects include mandatory MFA for computer logins, an employee acceptable use policy, and consistent security awareness training for both new and existing employees. However, significant vulnerabilities were identified, including an exposed Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) port on the network, and a critical lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email and sensitive data systems. These gaps present considerable risks to the organization's data integrity and overall security.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "RDP Exposure",
                        "Overview": "Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed directly to the internet via an open port 3389. This allows potential attackers to attempt brute-force attacks or exploit vulnerabilities in the RDP service to gain unauthorized access to internal systems. This was identified via a network scan showing port 3389 open and the 'ms-wbt-server' service running.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "IP address with open port 3389"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "MFA Not Required for Email",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks, as a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to an employee's email, potentially leading to further internal network access or data exfiltration. This was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Email system",
                            "All employee email accounts"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "MFA Not Required for Sensitive Data Systems",
                        "Overview": "Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access sensitive data systems. This poses a high risk, as unauthorized access to these systems could lead to severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and significant financial and reputational damage if a single password is compromised. This was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Sensitive data systems"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately close port 3389 to external access to prevent RDP exposure. For secure remote access, implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution. Furthermore, implement and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and sensitive data systems across the organization to significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials. Continue with existing security awareness training and acceptable use policies, and regularly review and update security policies to address emerging threats and ensure comprehensive protection.",
            "Conclusion": "While the organization has established a foundation of security practices, including MFA for computer logins and regular security awareness training, critical vulnerabilities remain. The exposed RDP port and the absence of MFA for email and sensitive data systems represent significant attack vectors that could lead to unauthorized access and data breaches. Addressing these high-severity risks is paramount to enhancing the organization's overall security posture and improving its readiness against sophisticated cyber threats."
