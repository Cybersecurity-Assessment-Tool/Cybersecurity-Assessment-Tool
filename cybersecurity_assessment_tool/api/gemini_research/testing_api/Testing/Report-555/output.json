            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network currently exposes a MySQL database (version 5.7.33) on port 3306, which is open to the network. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required for computer logins and sensitive data systems, it is not enforced for email access. The organization has an acceptable use policy and provides security awareness training for new employees, but lacks annual security awareness training for all employees.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Database Exposure",
                        "Overview": "MySQL port 3306 is open to the network, exposing the database service (version 5.7.33). This direct exposure increases the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, or denial-of-service attacks if vulnerabilities in the MySQL service are exploited. The vulnerability was identified through network scanning.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Port 3306 (MySQL)",
                            "MySQL Database Server"
                        ]

                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Email Access",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee inboxes if credentials are compromised through phishing, malware, or other means. Compromised email accounts can lead to business email compromise (BEC) attacks, data exfiltration, or further internal network penetration. This was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Email accounts",
                            "Employee credentials",
                            "Email system"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This gap means employees may not be regularly updated on evolving cyber threats, best practices, and organizational security policies, increasing their susceptibility to social engineering, phishing, and other human-factor attacks over time. This was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "Organizational security posture"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement strict firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted internal IP addresses or via a secure VPN. Furthermore, immediate implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access is crucial to protect against credential compromise. The organization should also establish a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees to ensure continuous education on current threats and best practices, reinforcing a strong security culture.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization faces significant risks due to an exposed database service and a critical gap in email security with the absence of MFA. Additionally, the lack of recurring security awareness training for all employees presents a medium-level risk by not adequately preparing the human element against evolving threats. Addressing these vulnerabilities is paramount to enhancing the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and protecting sensitive assets."
