        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization operates an Nginx web server (version 1.18.0) accessible via HTTPS on port 443. While the organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and conducts regular security awareness training for all employees, significant gaps exist in its authentication posture for internal systems. Specifically, MFA is not required for computer logins or for accessing sensitive data systems. An acceptable use policy is in place, and new employees receive security awareness training.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Nginx Server with Known Vulnerabilities - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nginx web server running on port 443 (HTTPS) is version 1.18.0. This version is significantly outdated, having been released in April 2020, and is known to contain several security vulnerabilities. These include CVE-2021-23017 (resolver stack buffer overflow), which could lead to denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution, and CVE-2022-41741/CVE-2022-41742 (HTTP/3 request smuggling), which could bypass security controls. Running outdated software increases the attack surface and makes the system susceptible to known exploits, potentially compromising the web server and hosted applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Nginx 1.18.0 server on port 443</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Authentication for Computer Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if an employee's credentials are compromised through phishing, malware, or other means. Without a second factor, a stolen password is often sufficient for an attacker to gain access to internal systems, potentially leading to lateral movement within the network and further compromise.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Internal network access points</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Authentication for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if credentials are compromised. Attackers gaining access to these systems could lead to severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and significant reputational and financial damage. The absence of MFA on these critical systems represents a single point of failure in authentication.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>Cloud storage</li><li>Specific applications holding sensitive information</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately update the Nginx web server to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities and improve overall security. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins across the organization to significantly enhance protection against credential theft and unauthorized access. Furthermore, extend MFA requirements to all sensitive data systems to safeguard critical information and comply with best security practices. Regularly review and update security policies and conduct penetration testing to identify and address potential weaknesses proactively.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security through its use of MFA for email and regular security awareness training. However, the presence of an outdated web server and critical gaps in MFA implementation for computer logins and sensitive data systems expose the organization to significant risks of unauthorized access and data breaches. Addressing these vulnerabilities is paramount to improving the overall security posture and readiness against cyber threats.</p>
