            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network assessment revealed several critical vulnerabilities and significant gaps in its security posture. An Nmap scan identified an active FTP server (vsftpd 2.3.4) on port 21, configured to allow anonymous login, posing a direct risk of unauthorized data access. Furthermore, a review of organizational policies indicates a lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems, despite MFA being required for computer logins. There is also an absence of an employee acceptable use policy and no regular security awareness training for new or existing employees. Compounding these issues, several workstations are running Windows 7, an end-of-life operating system, leaving them highly susceptible to known exploits.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Anonymous FTP Login Allowed",
                        "Overview": "The FTP server (vsftpd 2.3.4) running on port 21 is configured to allow anonymous login. This configuration permits unauthorized users to access files on the server without authentication, potentially leading to data leakage, unauthorized file uploads, or even server compromise if write permissions are misconfigured. This vulnerability was identified via an Nmap scan using the 'ftp-anon' script.",

                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks. A compromised email account can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and further lateral movement within the network.",

                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This leaves critical and confidential data vulnerable to unauthorized access if user credentials are stolen or compromised. A breach of sensitive data systems can result in severe financial penalties, reputational damage, and loss of customer trust.",

                        "Risk": "Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy",
                        "Overview": "The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines, employees may unknowingly engage in activities that pose security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling company data. This increases the likelihood of security incidents, legal liabilities, and operational disruptions.",

                        "Risk": "Insufficient Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees, nor does it provide annual training for all employees. This leaves the workforce susceptible to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting), malware, and other cyber threats due to a lack of knowledge regarding best security practices. Human error is a leading cause of security breaches, and inadequate training exacerbates this risk.",

                        "Risk": "Outdated Windows Policy",
                        "Overview": "Several workstations within the organization are running Windows 7, an operating system that reached its end-of-life in January 2020. This means these systems no longer receive security updates, patches, or technical support from Microsoft, making them highly vulnerable to known exploits and newly discovered threats. The impact includes potential system compromise, data loss, and non-compliance with industry regulations.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to disable anonymous access on the FTP server immediately; if FTP access is essential, implement secure alternatives like SFTP or FTPS with strong authentication. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be implemented for all email accounts and access to sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access. The organization should develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to guide appropriate behavior regarding IT resources. Furthermore, a mandatory security awareness training program should be established for all new hires and conducted annually for all employees to educate them on current cyber threats and best practices. Finally, all workstations running Windows 7 must be upgraded to a currently supported operating system (e.g., Windows 10 or 11) to ensure they receive critical security updates and patches, potentially requiring hardware refreshes.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces a high level of cybersecurity risk due to a combination of outdated systems, critical configuration vulnerabilities, and significant gaps in its security policies and employee training programs. The presence of an anonymous FTP server, lack of MFA for critical access points, and the use of end-of-life operating systems create easily exploitable entry points for attackers. Without immediate and comprehensive remediation efforts, the organization remains highly susceptible to data breaches, system compromise, and operational disruption, indicating a low state of readiness against modern cyber threats."
