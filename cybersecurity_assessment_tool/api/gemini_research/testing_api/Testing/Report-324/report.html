        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Due to broken network scan data, a comprehensive technical assessment of the organization's network infrastructure could not be performed. However, an analysis of organizational policies and practices reveals significant gaps in security controls, particularly concerning multi-factor authentication for sensitive data, employee acceptable use policies, and crucial security awareness training programs. These policy-level deficiencies indicate a heightened risk posture, primarily driven by human factors and inadequate access controls for critical assets.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or other means. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to sensitive data, leading to potential data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and severe reputational damage. This vulnerability was identified through a review of organizational access control policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li><li>Confidential information</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This means there are no formal guidelines or rules for employees regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, internet, email, and data. This absence can lead to misuse of company assets, increased exposure to malware, data leakage, and potential legal liabilities, as employees may unknowingly or knowingly engage in risky behaviors without clear boundaries. This vulnerability was identified through a review of organizational HR and IT policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Network infrastructure</li><li>Data integrity</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) as they may be less familiar with company policies, security protocols, and common threats. This lack of initial training leaves new employees unprepared to identify and respond to security threats, increasing the organization's overall attack surface and susceptibility to human-factor exploits. This vulnerability was identified through a review of employee onboarding procedures.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Email systems</li><li>Internal applications</li><li>Organizational data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Annual Security Awareness Training for All Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not provide annual security awareness training for all employees. Regular training is crucial to keep employees updated on evolving threats, reinforce best practices, and maintain a strong security culture. Without periodic refreshers, employees may forget previous training, become complacent, or be unaware of new attack vectors, making them more vulnerable to sophisticated cyber threats over time. This vulnerability was identified through a review of ongoing employee development and security programs.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company data</li><li>IT infrastructure</li><li>Overall security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access. Furthermore, a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) must be developed, communicated, and enforced to establish clear guidelines for IT resource usage. Crucially, mandatory security awareness training programs should be established for all new employees during onboarding and conducted annually for all existing employees to foster a strong security culture and equip staff with the knowledge to identify and respond to evolving cyber threats.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks stemming from critical policy and training deficiencies. The absence of MFA for sensitive data systems, coupled with a lack of an acceptable use policy and comprehensive security awareness training for both new and existing employees, creates substantial vulnerabilities. Addressing these human-factor and access control gaps is paramount to enhancing the organization's overall security posture and readiness against potential cyberattacks.</p>
