        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently has an open MySQL database running version 5.7.33 on port 3306. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for computer logins and sensitive data systems, it is notably absent for email access. The organization conducts security awareness training for both new and existing employees annually, which is a positive aspect. However, there is no employee acceptable use policy in place.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network, potentially exposing the database to unauthorized access. This could lead to data breaches, unauthorized data modification, or denial of service if exploited. The vulnerability was identified through network scanning.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted IP addresses or internal networks. For a more robust long-term solution, consider establishing a Virtual Private Network (VPN) for secure access to the database. Furthermore, the organization should immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access to enhance account security. Finally, developing and enforcing a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy is crucial to define expected behavior and reduce insider threats.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In conclusion, the organization demonstrates a mixed security posture. While strong in security awareness training and MFA for critical systems, the open MySQL port 3306 presents a significant 'High' severity risk of database exposure. Additionally, the lack of MFA for email and an employee acceptable use policy are notable gaps that could be exploited. Addressing these vulnerabilities and policy deficiencies is critical to improving the overall cybersecurity readiness and protecting sensitive data.</p>
