            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network scan revealed an open HTTP port (80). The organization currently does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access or computer logins. Additionally, there is no employee acceptable use policy in place. However, the organization does implement MFA for sensitive data systems and conducts security awareness training for all employees, including new hires, at least once per year.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Open HTTP Port (80)",
                        "Overview": "An open HTTP port (80) was identified during the network scan. This port is commonly used for unencrypted web traffic. Without proper configuration and security measures, this can expose the organization to various web-based attacks, including data interception, injection attacks, and server compromise. The lack of encryption makes any data transmitted over this port vulnerable to eavesdropping.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Port 80",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Email Access",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. Compromised email accounts can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and further network penetration.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Email system",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Computer Login",
                        "Overview": "Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for logging into computers within the organization. This leaves computer systems vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials (username/password) are compromised. Attackers could gain access to internal systems, sensitive data, and potentially move laterally within the network.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All organizational computers",
                            "User accounts"
                        ]

                    {
                        "Risk": "Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)",
                        "Overview": "The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy (AUP). An AUP defines the proper and acceptable use of organizational IT resources, including networks, systems, and data. Without a clear policy, employees may unknowingly engage in activities that introduce security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive information, leading to potential data breaches or system compromises.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "Organizational IT resources"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "It is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and computer logins to significantly enhance credential security and prevent unauthorized access. For the open HTTP port (80), immediate action should be taken to either close it if not needed, or redirect all traffic to HTTPS (port 443) with a valid SSL/TLS certificate to ensure encrypted communication. Furthermore, the organization must develop and implement a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) to clearly define guidelines for IT resource usage and mitigate human-factor risks. Regular audits of network configurations and security policies should also be conducted.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security through regular security awareness training and MFA for sensitive data systems. However, critical vulnerabilities exist due to the absence of MFA for email and computer logins, an open HTTP port, and the lack of an acceptable use policy. Addressing these high-priority risks is crucial for improving the overall security posture and reducing the likelihood of successful cyberattacks."
