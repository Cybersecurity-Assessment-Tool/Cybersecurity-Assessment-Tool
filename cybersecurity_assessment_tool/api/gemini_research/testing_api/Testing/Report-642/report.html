        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan indicates that port 80 is closed, suggesting no unencrypted web server is directly exposed. However, the organizational data reveals several areas of concern regarding security posture. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is not required for email or sensitive data systems, significantly increasing the risk of unauthorized access. Furthermore, the absence of an employee acceptable use policy and security awareness training for new employees indicates gaps in foundational security practices, although annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Email accounts are a primary target for phishing and credential stuffing attacks. Without MFA, compromised credentials can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive communications and potential lateral movement within the network. This vulnerability was identified through a review of organizational security policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Critical systems containing sensitive data are vulnerable to unauthorized access if only a single factor of authentication is required. A compromised credential could grant an attacker direct access to valuable assets, leading to data breaches or system compromise. This vulnerability was identified through a review of organizational security policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts with access to sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Without a formal acceptable use policy, employees may be unaware of their responsibilities regarding company IT resources, data handling, and internet usage. This can lead to risky behaviors, data leakage, and increased susceptibility to social engineering attacks. This vulnerability was identified through a review of organizational policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>IT resources</li><li>Data handling practices</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of New Employee Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees are often targets for social engineering attacks as they may be less familiar with company security protocols and common threats. The absence of initial security awareness training leaves them vulnerable and increases the overall human risk factor for the organization. This vulnerability was identified through a review of organizational training programs.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and sensitive data systems immediately. This critical step will drastically reduce the risk of unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised. Furthermore, the organization should develop and formally implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to clearly define expectations for IT resource usage and data handling. Mandatory security awareness training for all new employees must be introduced to ensure they are equipped with essential knowledge from day one, complementing the existing annual training for all staff. Regular reviews of security policies and controls should also be conducted to adapt to evolving threat landscapes.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant risks due to the lack of multi-factor authentication for critical systems like email and sensitive data access, leaving these vulnerable to credential-based attacks. Foundational security practices are also lacking, specifically the absence of an acceptable use policy and initial security awareness training for new hires. While annual security training is in place, these gaps indicate a moderate to high level of readiness deficiency, particularly in protecting sensitive information and establishing a robust security culture from the outset. Addressing these vulnerabilities is crucial for improving overall resilience against cyber threats.</p>
