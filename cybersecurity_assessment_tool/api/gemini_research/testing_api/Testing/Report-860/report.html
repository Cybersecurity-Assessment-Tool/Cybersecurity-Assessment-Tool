        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization exhibits a foundational level of security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, and maintaining an employee acceptable use policy. New employees receive initial security awareness training. However, significant security gaps were identified, including the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems and the lack of annual security awareness training for all employees. A network scan also revealed an open HTTP port (80), which presents a potential risk if not adequately secured or if unencrypted data is transmitted.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Multi-Factor Authentication for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or other means. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to sensitive data, leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Infrequent Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual training for all employees. This leads to a degradation of security knowledge over time, making employees more susceptible to evolving social engineering tactics, phishing attempts, and other human-factor vulnerabilities. Regular, recurring training is crucial to maintain a strong security posture and ensure employees are equipped to identify and report threats. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open HTTP Port (Port 80) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A network scan identified an open HTTP port (port 80). While this port is commonly used for web services, an open and unencrypted HTTP port can expose web traffic to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. If sensitive information is transmitted over HTTP, it is vulnerable to interception. Furthermore, an open port can be an entry point for various web-based attacks if the underlying service is not properly secured and patched. This was identified via Nmap network scan data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Network perimeter</li><li>Web server (if applicable)</li><li>Any service running on port 80</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization implement Multi-Factor Authentication for all sensitive data systems immediately. This will significantly enhance protection against unauthorized access and reduce the impact of compromised credentials. Furthermore, a comprehensive annual security awareness training program should be established for all employees to ensure continuous education on evolving threats and best practices, thereby strengthening the human firewall. Regarding the open port 80, a thorough investigation is required to identify the service running on it. If it's a web service, it should be secured with HTTPS (port 443) to encrypt all traffic, and the underlying application must be regularly patched and configured securely. If the port is not essential for business operations, it should be closed to reduce the attack surface.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently maintains a mixed security posture. While some essential security controls like MFA for email and computer access are in place, the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems represents a critical vulnerability that could lead to severe data breaches. The lack of recurring security awareness training for all employees also leaves the organization susceptible to human-factor exploits. The presence of an open HTTP port requires immediate attention to prevent potential exploitation. Addressing these key areas will significantly improve the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness, reduce its attack surface, and enhance its ability to protect sensitive information.</p>
