        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Based on the provided organizational data, the organization currently lacks multi-factor authentication (MFA) across critical access points including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. While an acceptable use policy is in place and annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees, there is a significant gap in providing security awareness training for new employees. This indicates a foundational weakness in access control and initial employee onboarding security.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for email access. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. Compromised email accounts can lead to further internal system breaches, data exfiltration, and business email compromise (BEC) scams. This was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email accounts</li><li>Email servers</li><li>User credentials</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for logging into computers. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if user credentials are stolen or guessed. An attacker gaining access to a computer can potentially move laterally within the network, access sensitive data, or deploy malware. This was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Servers</li><li>Network access points</li><li>User credentials</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for accessing sensitive data systems. This is a critical vulnerability as it exposes the most valuable organizational assets to a single point of failure (password). If an attacker compromises credentials for these systems, they gain direct access to sensitive information, leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and severe reputational damage. This was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>Cloud storage</li><li>Critical applications</li><li>User credentials</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. This means new hires may not be immediately aware of the organization's security policies, common cyber threats (like phishing), and best practices from day one. This increases the likelihood of new employees inadvertently introducing vulnerabilities or falling victim to social engineering attacks, potentially compromising the organization's security posture. This was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security culture</li><li>Internal systems susceptible to social engineering</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) across all critical access points. This includes enforcing MFA for email access, computer logins, and especially for all sensitive data systems. Furthermore, a mandatory security awareness training program should be established for all new employees as part of their onboarding process to ensure they are equipped with essential cybersecurity knowledge and best practices from their first day. Regular, comprehensive security awareness training for all employees should also continue annually, reinforcing a strong security culture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant security risks primarily due to the widespread absence of multi-factor authentication across email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. This foundational weakness in access control makes the organization highly susceptible to credential-based attacks and unauthorized access. Additionally, the lack of security awareness training for new employees introduces a critical gap in human-element security from the outset. While an acceptable use policy and annual training for existing employees are positive steps, addressing the MFA and new employee training deficiencies is paramount to improving overall cybersecurity readiness and mitigating the high potential for data breaches and system compromises.</p>
