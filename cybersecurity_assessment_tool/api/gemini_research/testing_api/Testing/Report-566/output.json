            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network includes an FTP server running vsftpd 2.3.4 with anonymous login enabled. Security policies indicate that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for email access, but is enforced for computer logins and sensitive data systems. An acceptable use policy is in place, and annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees, though new employees do not receive specific security awareness training upon onboarding.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Outdated Windows Policy",
                        "Overview": "Computers are running Windows 7, which is an end-of-life operating system. This poses significant security risks due to the lack of security updates and patches, making systems vulnerable to known exploits and malware. This was identified through internal policy review.",

                        "Risk": "Anonymous FTP Access Allowed",
                        "Overview": "The FTP server (vsftpd 2.3.4) allows anonymous login. This permits unauthorized users to access, upload, or download files without authentication, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized file distribution, or server compromise. This was identified via an Nmap scan with the ftp-anon script.",

                        "Risk": "No MFA for Email Access",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing or credential stuffing attacks, as a single compromised password could grant full access to an employee's email. This was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                    {
                        "Risk": "Inadequate New Employee Security Training",
                        "Overview": "New employees do not receive specific security awareness training upon joining the organization. This leaves new hires potentially unaware of critical security policies, best practices, and common threats (e.g., phishing), increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents. This was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "New Employees",
                            "Organizational Security Posture"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "It is strongly recommended to upgrade all workstations running Windows 7 to a supported operating system like Windows 10 or 11, considering a hardware refresh if current machines do not meet minimum requirements. Immediately disable anonymous FTP access on the vsftpd server and implement strong authentication mechanisms with proper access controls for all FTP users. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access to significantly reduce the risk of account compromise. Furthermore, establish a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees as part of their onboarding process, covering essential security policies, threat identification, and reporting procedures, while continuing with annual security awareness training for all employees.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization faces several significant security risks, including the use of end-of-life operating systems, an anonymously accessible FTP server, and a lack of MFA for email. While some security measures like MFA for sensitive systems and annual training are in place, critical gaps remain, particularly in endpoint security, network service configuration, and initial employee security education. Addressing these vulnerabilities is crucial for improving the overall security posture and readiness against cyber threats."
