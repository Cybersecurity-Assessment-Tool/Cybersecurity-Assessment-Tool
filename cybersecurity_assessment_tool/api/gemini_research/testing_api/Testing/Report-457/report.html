        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network includes at least one active host with an open HTTPS port (443) running Nginx version 1.18.0, indicating a web server is operational. From an organizational security posture perspective, the company has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and computer logins, which is a positive step. However, critical gaps exist, including the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems, a lack of an employee acceptable use policy, and no security awareness training for new employees. While annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees, the initial onboarding phase for new hires and the protection of sensitive data systems represent significant areas of concern.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Multi-Factor Authentication for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or other means. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to highly sensitive data, leading to severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and reputational damage. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on sensitive data systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy (AUP). Without a formal AUP, there are no clear guidelines or rules for how employees should use company IT resources, including networks, devices, and data. This absence can lead to various security risks such as misuse of company assets, increased exposure to malware from unapproved software or websites, data leakage, and potential legal liabilities due to inappropriate online behavior or data handling. This vulnerability was identified from the organizational data stating 'No' for an acceptable use policy.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Network infrastructure</li><li>Company data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) as they may be less familiar with company policies, security protocols, and common threat vectors. This oversight leaves the organization vulnerable to human-factor exploits from the moment a new employee joins, potentially leading to credential compromise, malware infections, or data breaches. This vulnerability was identified from the organizational data stating 'No' for security awareness training for new employees.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Email systems</li><li>Internal networks</li><li>Company data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Web Server Software - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The network scan identified an Nginx web server running version 1.18.0. This version was released in April 2020 and is no longer actively maintained or receiving security updates. Running outdated software, especially a publicly exposed web server, exposes the organization to known vulnerabilities that have been patched in newer versions. Attackers can exploit these publicly disclosed flaws to gain unauthorized access, deface the website, or compromise the underlying server. This vulnerability was identified through the network scan data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Web server (nginx 1.18.0) on port 443</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access. Concurrently, develop and enforce a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) to establish clear guidelines for IT resource usage and reduce misuse. Furthermore, integrate mandatory security awareness training into the onboarding process for all new employees to educate them on common threats and company security protocols from day one. Finally, the Nginx web server should be updated to the latest stable and supported version to patch known vulnerabilities and ensure ongoing security updates.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing MFA for email and computer logins, and conducting annual security awareness training. However, significant vulnerabilities remain, particularly the critical lack of MFA for sensitive data systems, the absence of an acceptable use policy, and the failure to provide security awareness training to new employees. The use of an outdated Nginx web server further compounds the risk, exposing the organization to known exploits. Addressing these high-severity gaps is paramount to improving the overall security posture and readiness against modern cyber threats.</p>
