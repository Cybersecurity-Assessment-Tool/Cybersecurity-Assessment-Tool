        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's current security posture reveals several critical vulnerabilities, primarily stemming from a lack of foundational security controls and policies. There is no Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) required for accessing email, logging into computers, or accessing sensitive data systems, which significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access. Furthermore, the absence of an employee acceptable use policy and the lack of annual security awareness training for all employees indicate gaps in human-centric security measures. Network scans also identified an open SSH port (port 22) on a host, presenting a potential entry point if not adequately secured.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. This means that a single compromised credential (e.g., a stolen password) could grant an attacker full access to these systems, leading to data breaches, unauthorized system control, or further lateral movement within the network. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email systems</li><li>Employee workstations/laptops</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an established employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines on the proper use of company IT resources, employees may inadvertently or intentionally engage in activities that pose security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or misusing company assets. This increases the likelihood of malware infections, data leakage, and compliance issues. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee-accessed systems and networks</li><li>Organizational data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, there is no annual training provided for all employees. This leaves the workforce vulnerable to evolving cyber threats such as sophisticated phishing attacks, social engineering tactics, and new malware variants. Employees who are not regularly updated on current threats and best practices are more likely to fall victim to these attacks, potentially compromising organizational data and systems. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port (Port 22) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A network scan identified an open SSH port (port 22) on a host within the network. While SSH is a legitimate service for secure remote access, an open port without robust security configurations (e.g., strong, unique passwords, key-based authentication, IP restrictions, rate limiting, and MFA) can be a target for brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or exploitation of SSH vulnerabilities. Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized remote access to the host. This vulnerability was identified via network scan data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host(s) with open port 22</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's cybersecurity posture, immediate action is required across several key areas. Firstly, implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, to prevent unauthorized access from compromised credentials. Secondly, develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to establish clear guidelines for IT resource usage and mitigate insider risks. Thirdly, establish a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees to educate them on current threats and best practices, thereby reducing human-centric vulnerabilities. Lastly, review and secure all open network ports, specifically focusing on the identified open SSH port (port 22). This should involve disabling password authentication in favor of strong key-based authentication, implementing IP-based access restrictions, and considering MFA for SSH access where feasible.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks due to a lack of fundamental security controls, policies, and ongoing employee education. The absence of MFA across critical systems, coupled with the lack of an acceptable use policy and annual security awareness training, creates a highly vulnerable environment susceptible to unauthorized access and human error. The presence of an open SSH port further compounds these risks by providing a potential entry point for attackers. Addressing these vulnerabilities through the recommended actions is crucial for improving the organization's overall security readiness and protecting its assets from cyber threats.</p>
