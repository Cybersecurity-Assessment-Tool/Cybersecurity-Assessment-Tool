        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to identity and access management by requiring Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and access to sensitive data systems. An employee acceptable use policy is also in place, indicating foundational governance. However, a critical vulnerability was identified during network scanning: an open port 8080 exposing a service titled 'TOP SECRET DB'. This represents a severe information disclosure risk and potential unauthorized access vector. Furthermore, a significant gap exists in the organization's security posture due to the complete absence of security awareness training for both new and existing employees, which elevates the risk of human-factor incidents.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Sensitive Information Disclosure via Open Port 8080 - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open port 8080 was discovered on a network host, which, upon inspection, revealed the HTTP title 'TOP SECRET DB'. This indicates that a potentially highly sensitive database or application is directly exposed on the network. The explicit mention of 'TOP SECRET DB' in the service title is a critical information disclosure, providing attackers with direct insight into the nature of the exposed service and potentially facilitating targeted attacks for unauthorized access or data exfiltration. This vulnerability was identified through Nmap's http-title script during the network scan.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li><li>Host with open port 8080</li><li>Service/Application 'TOP SECRET DB'</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently does not conduct security awareness training for new employees, nor does it provide annual security awareness training for all employees. This absence creates a significant human-factor vulnerability, increasing the organization's susceptibility to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting), malware infections, and accidental data breaches. Employees who are not regularly educated on cybersecurity best practices and current threats are more likely to fall victim to sophisticated attacks, thereby compromising organizational security.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediate action is required to address the critical information disclosure on port 8080. The service running on this port must be thoroughly investigated to determine its purpose and sensitivity. If the service is not intended for public access, it should be immediately firewalled and restricted to authorized internal networks only. If it requires external access, robust authentication (preferably with MFA) and authorization controls must be implemented, and the service's title or banners should be modified to avoid disclosing sensitive information. Concurrently, the organization must establish and implement a comprehensive security awareness training program. This program should include mandatory training for all new employees during onboarding and annual refresher training for all existing employees, covering topics such as phishing, social engineering, secure data handling, and incident reporting. Regular simulated phishing exercises should also be conducted to test and reinforce employee awareness.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has implemented strong MFA controls and an acceptable use policy, indicating a foundational understanding of security, the presence of a critically exposed 'TOP SECRET DB' service on port 8080 and the complete lack of security awareness training represent significant and immediate risks. The 'TOP SECRET DB' exposure could lead to severe data breaches, while the absence of employee training leaves the organization vulnerable to human-factor exploits. Addressing these critical and high-severity vulnerabilities promptly is paramount to enhancing the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and readiness against evolving threats.</p>
