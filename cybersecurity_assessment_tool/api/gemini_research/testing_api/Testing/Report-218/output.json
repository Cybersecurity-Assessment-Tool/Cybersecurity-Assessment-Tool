                "Summary": "The organization's network scan revealed an active FTP server (vsftpd 2.3.4) with anonymous login enabled, posing a significant data exposure risk. Internally, the organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access, which is a critical vulnerability for account compromise. Furthermore, there is no formal employee acceptable use policy, and new employees do not receive security awareness training, increasing human-factor risks. A major concern is the continued use of Windows 7 on workstations, an operating system past its end-of-life, making these systems highly susceptible to exploitation. While MFA is required for computer logins and sensitive data systems, and annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees, these measures are undermined by the identified critical gaps.",

                        "Risk": "Anonymous FTP Access",
                        "Overview": "An FTP server (vsftpd 2.3.4) is configured to allow anonymous login. This configuration can lead to unauthorized access to files, potential data leakage, or even server compromise if write permissions are misconfigured. This vulnerability was identified via an Nmap scan using the 'ftp-anon' script.",

                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Email",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks, as a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to an employee's email, which often serves as a gateway to other sensitive systems and information.",

                        "Risk": "No Employee Acceptable Use Policy",
                        "Overview": "The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines, employees may unknowingly engage in activities that introduce security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive data, potentially leading to security breaches or compliance violations.",

                        "Overview": "New employees do not receive security awareness training upon joining the organization. This leaves them vulnerable to common cyber threats like phishing, social engineering, and malware from the outset, as they may not be aware of organizational security policies, best practices, or how to identify and report suspicious activities.",

                        "Risk": "Outdated Windows Policy",
                        "Overview": "Several workstations within the organization are running Windows 7. This operating system has reached its end-of-life and no longer receives security updates from Microsoft, making these systems highly vulnerable to known exploits, malware, and zero-day attacks. Continued use of Windows 7 poses a critical risk to the entire network.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately disable anonymous FTP access and ensure all FTP services are properly secured with strong authentication. Implement mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access to significantly reduce the risk of account compromise. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy, ensuring all employees are aware of their responsibilities regarding IT resource usage. Establish and implement mandatory security awareness training for all new employees as part of their onboarding process, in addition to the existing annual training. Most critically, all workstations running Windows 7 must be upgraded to a currently supported operating system (e.g., Windows 10 or 11) to address the severe security vulnerabilities associated with end-of-life software. Consider a hardware refresh if existing workstations cannot support newer OS versions.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization faces several significant cybersecurity risks, primarily stemming from an outdated operating system on workstations, insecure FTP configurations, and critical gaps in human-factor security controls such as MFA for email and initial security awareness training. While some security measures are in place, the identified vulnerabilities present a substantial attack surface that could lead to data breaches, system compromise, and operational disruption. Addressing these critical and high-severity risks should be an immediate priority to enhance the organization's overall security posture and readiness against evolving cyber threats."
