        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and access to sensitive data systems, and maintains an employee acceptable use policy. New employees receive initial security awareness training. However, there are notable gaps in the security posture concerning email access and ongoing, annual security awareness training for all employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. Compromised email accounts can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and serve as a pivot point for further network penetration. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on email access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee email accounts</li><li>Email server/service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. While new employees receive initial training, the lack of recurring training means employees may not be updated on the latest threats, best practices, or evolving company policies. This increases the likelihood of employees falling victim to social engineering attacks, mishandling sensitive data, or inadvertently introducing malware into the network. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for annual security awareness training for all employees.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network security</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts across the organization. This is a critical step to protect against credential theft and unauthorized access. Additionally, establish and enforce a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees. This training should be comprehensive, covering current threats, phishing recognition, data handling best practices, and incident reporting procedures. Regularly reviewing and updating security policies and ensuring their effective communication to all staff will further enhance the organization's security posture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing MFA for sensitive systems and computer logins, and having an acceptable use policy. However, critical vulnerabilities exist due to the absence of MFA for email access and the lack of consistent, annual security awareness training for all employees. Addressing these specific gaps is crucial to significantly enhance the organization's overall security posture, reduce the risk of successful cyberattacks, and foster a more resilient security culture.</p>
