        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's external network perimeter appears to be well-secured, with no open ports or immediate vulnerabilities identified by the basic network scan. Internally, the organization demonstrates a proactive approach to security awareness, providing training for both new and existing employees annually, and has an acceptable use policy in place. However, significant gaps exist in the implementation of multi-factor authentication (MFA) across critical access points.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require multi-factor authentication for employees to log into their computers. This policy significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to internal systems and data if an employee's primary credentials (username and password) are compromised through phishing, malware, or other means. Without a second factor, a stolen password alone is sufficient for an attacker to gain access, potentially leading to lateral movement within the network and further compromise. This vulnerability was identified through organizational policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>User accounts</li><li>Internal network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Access to systems containing sensitive organizational data does not mandate multi-factor authentication. This represents a critical vulnerability, as the compromise of a single set of credentials could grant an attacker direct access to highly confidential or proprietary information. The absence of MFA on these systems makes them prime targets for data breaches, intellectual property theft, and compliance violations. This vulnerability was identified through organizational policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data repositories</li><li>Databases</li><li>Cloud storage for sensitive data</li><li>Applications handling sensitive information</li><li>User accounts with access to sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all computer logins, including workstations and servers. Furthermore, MFA must be enforced for all access points to sensitive data systems to protect against unauthorized data breaches. A more comprehensive internal network scan should be conducted to identify any potential vulnerabilities within the internal infrastructure that were not covered by the external scan. Regular reviews of access controls and privilege management should also be performed to ensure the principle of least privilege is consistently applied.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has established a good foundation with security awareness training and an acceptable use policy, and its external network appears robust, the absence of multi-factor authentication for computer logins and sensitive data systems presents critical vulnerabilities. These gaps significantly elevate the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. Addressing these MFA deficiencies is paramount to improving the overall security readiness and protecting valuable organizational assets.</p>
