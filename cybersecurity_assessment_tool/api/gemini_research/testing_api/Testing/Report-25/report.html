        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an Nginx web server version 1.18.0 running on port 443. While critical vulnerabilities were not immediately identified for this specific version, it is not the latest stable release. Organizational data indicates strong security practices in some areas, such as requiring MFA for email and sensitive data systems, and conducting annual security awareness training for all employees. However, significant gaps exist, particularly regarding MFA for computer logins and initial security awareness training for new employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if an employee's credentials are stolen or compromised through phishing, malware, or brute-force attacks. Without MFA, a single factor (password) is sufficient to gain access, making systems highly susceptible to credential-based attacks and potentially leading to lateral movement within the network.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee workstations</li><li>Domain controllers</li><li>Network devices requiring login</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering and phishing attacks as they may be less familiar with organizational security policies, common attack vectors, and how to identify suspicious communications. This lack of initial training leaves them vulnerable and potentially makes them an unwitting entry point for attackers, increasing the risk of data breaches or malware infections.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Web Server Software - <span class="severity-Low">Low</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nginx web server running on port 443 is version 1.18.0. While this version is relatively stable, it is not the latest stable release. Running outdated software can expose the organization to known vulnerabilities that have been patched in newer versions, increasing the attack surface and potential for exploitation by malicious actors. Regular updates are crucial for maintaining a strong security posture.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Web server (nginx 1.18.0)</li><li>Services hosted on port 443</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins across the organization to significantly enhance protection against credential theft. Additionally, a mandatory security awareness training program should be established for all new employees, covering common threats like phishing, social engineering, and best practices for data handling, to reduce human-factor vulnerabilities from the outset. Furthermore, the Nginx web server should be updated to the latest stable version to ensure all known security patches are applied and to benefit from the most current security features. Regular patch management for all software and systems is advised.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of cybersecurity by implementing MFA for sensitive systems and conducting annual security training. However, critical gaps in MFA for computer logins and initial security awareness training for new employees present significant risks for unauthorized access and social engineering attacks. Addressing these vulnerabilities, along with maintaining up-to-date software, is crucial for strengthening the overall security posture and readiness against evolving cyber threats.</p>
