        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network infrastructure was assessed, and while no specific technical vulnerabilities were identified through the provided network scan data, a review of organizational policies revealed several areas for improvement in security readiness. The organization currently employs Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and sensitive data systems, and conducts annual security awareness training for all employees. An acceptable use policy is also in place. However, critical gaps exist concerning email security and initial employee security training.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Email accounts are a primary target for phishing and credential stuffing attacks. Without MFA, compromised credentials can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive communications, data, and potentially other linked systems, increasing the risk of data breaches and business email compromise. This vulnerability was identified through the organization's self-reported policy stating no MFA is required for email access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee email accounts</li><li>Email server/service</li><li>Organizational communications</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Onboarding Security Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees are often unfamiliar with an organization's specific security policies, common threats (like phishing), and best practices. A lack of initial, mandatory security awareness training for new hires increases the risk of human error leading to security incidents, such as clicking malicious links, falling victim to social engineering, or mishandling sensitive information, potentially before they receive annual training. This was identified from the organization's self-reported policy stating no security awareness training for new employees.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network integrity</li><li>Overall security culture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access. This critical step will provide a robust layer of defense against unauthorized access to email accounts, mitigating the risk of phishing and credential compromise. Additionally, the organization should establish and enforce mandatory security awareness training as part of the onboarding process for all new employees. This initial training will ensure that new hires are immediately equipped with the knowledge and best practices necessary to identify and avoid common cyber threats, thereby reducing the likelihood of human-factor security incidents from the outset. Regular review and updates to the acceptable use policy and annual training content are also advised to keep pace with evolving threat landscapes.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the provided network scan data did not reveal any immediate technical vulnerabilities, the assessment of organizational policies highlights critical areas where the organization's readiness can be significantly improved. The absence of MFA for email access and the lack of initial security awareness training for new employees represent notable risks that could expose the organization to various cyber threats. Addressing these policy gaps through the recommended actions will strengthen the overall security posture, reduce the attack surface, and foster a more security-conscious culture within the organization.</p>
