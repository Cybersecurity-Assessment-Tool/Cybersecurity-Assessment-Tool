        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network includes an FTP server running vsftpd 2.3.4 with anonymous login enabled. Workstations are running outdated Windows 7. The organization requires MFA for computer logins but not for email or sensitive data systems. There is no employee acceptable use policy, and new employees do not receive security awareness training, though annual training is provided for all employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Anonymous FTP Login Allowed - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The FTP service (vsftpd 2.3.4) on port 21 allows anonymous login. This can lead to unauthorized access to files, data leakage, or even arbitrary file uploads if not properly configured, posing a significant risk to data confidentiality and integrity. This was identified via an Nmap scan.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>FTP Server (vsftpd 2.3.4)</li><li>Port 21</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing or brute-force attacks, as a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to an employee's email. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised, potentially leading to data breaches and regulatory non-compliance. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines, employees may engage in activities that introduce security risks (e.g., installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, improper data handling), leading to increased exposure to malware, data loss, and legal liabilities. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational network</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training. This means new hires may not be aware of common cyber threats, organizational security policies, or best practices from day one, making them more susceptible to social engineering attacks and increasing the likelihood of security incidents. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational network</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Windows Policy - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Computers are running Windows 7, an operating system that has reached its end-of-life for mainstream support. This means it no longer receives security updates, leaving systems vulnerable to newly discovered exploits and increasing the risk of malware infection and system compromise. This was identified through an internal risk assessment.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediately disable anonymous FTP access and ensure proper authentication and authorization are in place for the FTP service. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access to enhance account security. Mandate Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to protect critical information. Develop and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to guide appropriate technology usage. Establish mandatory security awareness training for all new employees upon onboarding. Upgrade all workstations running Windows 7 to a currently supported operating system like Windows 10 or 11 to ensure ongoing security updates and patches. Consider a hardware refresh if current machines cannot support newer OS versions.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization faces several significant security vulnerabilities, including an anonymously accessible FTP server, the use of an end-of-life operating system (Windows 7) on workstations, and critical gaps in authentication policies (lack of MFA for email and sensitive data systems). Furthermore, the absence of an acceptable use policy and initial security awareness training for new employees indicates weaknesses in foundational security practices. While annual security training is conducted, these identified risks collectively present a substantial attack surface and elevate the overall risk of data breaches, system compromise, and operational disruption. Addressing these issues promptly is crucial for improving the organization's cybersecurity posture and readiness.</p>
