        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed no open ports on the target, indicating a potentially well-hardened external perimeter. Internally, the organization implements Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and access to sensitive data systems, and conducts annual security awareness training for all employees. However, critical gaps exist in the security posture, including the absence of MFA for email access, a lack of a formal employee acceptable use policy, and no dedicated security awareness training for new employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Employees can access their email accounts without multi-factor authentication, significantly increasing the risk of account compromise through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks. A compromised email account can serve as a gateway for attackers to gain further access to internal systems, sensitive data, or launch sophisticated social engineering attacks. This vulnerability was identified through a review of the organization's security policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee email accounts</li><li>Email system infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks a formal Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) that clearly defines the appropriate and prohibited use of company IT resources, data, and internet access. Without an AUP, employees may inadvertently or intentionally engage in activities that expose the organization to security risks, legal liabilities, or compliance violations due to a lack of clear guidelines. This vulnerability was identified through a review of the organization's policy documentation.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources (computers, networks, software, data)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees are not provided with initial security awareness training upon joining the organization. This leaves them unprepared to identify and respond to common cyber threats such as phishing emails, social engineering attempts, and malware, making them potential weak links in the organization's security chain during their critical onboarding period. While annual training is conducted, the absence of initial training creates an immediate exposure window. This vulnerability was identified through a review of the organization's onboarding procedures.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li><li>Data integrity</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all employee email accounts to significantly reduce the risk of account compromise. Furthermore, a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) should be developed, communicated, and enforced across all staff to establish clear guidelines for IT resource usage. Finally, a mandatory security awareness training program specifically for new employees must be introduced as part of the onboarding process to ensure all staff are equipped with essential cybersecurity knowledge from day one. These measures will significantly enhance the organization's overall security posture and reduce its susceptibility to common cyber threats.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the external network perimeter appears robust with no open ports identified in the scan, the organization faces significant internal security challenges. The absence of MFA for email, a formal Acceptable Use Policy, and initial security awareness training for new hires represent critical gaps that could be exploited by attackers. Addressing these organizational vulnerabilities is paramount to strengthening the overall security posture and ensuring a more resilient defense against evolving cyber threats, building upon the existing strengths of MFA for sensitive systems and annual training.</p>
