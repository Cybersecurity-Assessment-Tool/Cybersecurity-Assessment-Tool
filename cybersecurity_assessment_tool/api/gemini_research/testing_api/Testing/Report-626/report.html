        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently presents several significant security risks. A network scan identified an open FTP server running vsftpd 2.3.4 on port 21, which allows anonymous login. Furthermore, the organization's workstations are running an outdated Windows 7 operating system. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required for computer logins, it is notably absent for accessing email and sensitive data systems. On a positive note, the organization has an employee acceptable use policy and conducts security awareness training for both new and existing employees annually.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Anonymous FTP Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The network scan identified an FTP server (vsftpd 2.3.4) on port 21 that allows anonymous login. This configuration poses a significant risk as it can lead to unauthorized access to files, potential data leakage, or even server compromise if write permissions are misconfigured. This vulnerability was identified through Nmap's 'ftp-anon' script.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>FTP Server (vsftpd 2.3.4)</li><li>Port 21</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Windows Operating System - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization's workstations are running Windows 7, an operating system that has reached its end-of-life. This means it no longer receives critical security updates, leaving systems highly vulnerable to known exploits, malware, and zero-day attacks. Continued use of an unsupported OS significantly increases the attack surface and risk of compromise. This was identified from the provided current risks data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations running Windows 7</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Coverage - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email or sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access in the event of credential theft or compromise, as a single factor (password) remains the sole barrier to critical information. While MFA is used for computer logins, its absence in these key areas creates a substantial security gap. This was identified from the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email systems</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately disable anonymous login on the FTP server and implement robust authentication mechanisms, ensuring only authorized users can access the service. All workstations running Windows 7 must be upgraded to a currently supported operating system, such as Windows 10 or 11, to ensure they receive critical security updates and patches. Furthermore, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) should be promptly implemented and enforced for all access to email systems and sensitive data systems to significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials. The existing employee acceptable use policy and regular security awareness training are positive practices that should be continued and reinforced.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces critical and high-severity vulnerabilities, primarily due to an outdated operating system (Windows 7), an insecurely configured FTP server allowing anonymous access, and a lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for critical systems like email and sensitive data. While the organization demonstrates some security readiness through an acceptable use policy and regular security awareness training, these efforts are undermined by the fundamental weaknesses identified. Immediate action is required to address these core vulnerabilities to significantly improve the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and reduce its exposure to potential breaches.</p>
