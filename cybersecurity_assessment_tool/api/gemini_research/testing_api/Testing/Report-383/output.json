            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network scan revealed an open SSH port (22). Internally, the organization has an acceptable use policy and conducts annual security awareness training for all employees. However, critical security gaps exist, including the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and computer logins. Furthermore, new employees do not receive initial security awareness training, and a critical vulnerability related to an exposed localhost was identified.",

                        "Risk": "Localhost Exposed",
                        "Overview": "The system appears to have an exposed localhost interface, potentially allowing unauthorized access or information disclosure from internal network segments or misconfigured services. This could lead to data breaches or system compromise. Identified from provided risk data.",

                        "Overview": "The organization does not require MFA for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or stolen credentials, potentially leading to business email compromise (BEC) and data exfiltration. Identified from organizational policy data.",

                        "Overview": "The organization does not require MFA for logging into computers. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if passwords are stolen or weak, potentially allowing attackers to gain a foothold within the internal network. Identified from organizational policy data.",

                        "Risk": "Inadequate Security Awareness Training for New Hires",
                        "Overview": "New employees do not receive security awareness training upon joining the organization. This leaves them susceptible to social engineering attacks, phishing, and other common threats, as they may not be aware of best security practices from day one. Identified from organizational policy data.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Exposed SSH Service",
                        "Overview": "A Secure Shell (SSH) service is detected as open on port 22. While SSH is a legitimate service, an exposed and unsecured SSH port can be a target for brute-force attacks or exploitation of vulnerabilities in the SSH daemon, potentially granting unauthorized remote access to the system. Identified via network scan.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "Implement MFA for all email accounts and computer logins immediately to significantly reduce the risk of credential compromise. Provide mandatory security awareness training for all new employees as part of their onboarding process, in addition to the existing annual training. Review and secure the exposed SSH service on port 22, ensuring strong authentication, rate limiting, and only allowing access from trusted IP addresses. Investigate and remediate the 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability to prevent potential internal network exploitation. Regularly conduct vulnerability scans and penetration tests to identify and address security weaknesses proactively.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces several significant security vulnerabilities, primarily stemming from a lack of robust access controls (MFA) for critical systems like email and computer logins, and an exposed SSH service. While some foundational policies and training are in place, the absence of initial security awareness training for new hires and the critical 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability further degrade the overall security posture. Addressing these high-severity risks is paramount to enhancing the organization's readiness against cyber threats and preventing potential breaches."
