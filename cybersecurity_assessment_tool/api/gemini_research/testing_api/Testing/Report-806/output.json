            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network exhibits several critical security vulnerabilities. A network scan revealed an outdated FTP server (vsftpd 2.3.4) with anonymous access enabled, posing a significant risk for unauthorized data access or system compromise. Furthermore, the organization relies on end-of-life operating systems (Windows 7) for its workstations, leaving them exposed to known and unpatched vulnerabilities. A major systemic weakness is the complete absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, making credential-based attacks highly effective. The lack of an employee acceptable use policy (AUP) introduces further operational risk. While security awareness training is conducted for all employees, the fundamental technical and policy controls are severely lacking, indicating a low overall security readiness.",

                        "Risk": "Anonymous FTP Access & Outdated FTP Server",
                        "Overview": "The network scan identified an open FTP service (vsftpd 2.3.4) on port 21 that allows anonymous login. This version of vsftpd is significantly outdated and known to have multiple vulnerabilities (e.g., CVE-2011-2523, CVE-2011-0762). Anonymous access allows unauthorized users to potentially upload or download files, leading to data breaches, malware injection, or system compromise.",

                        "Overview": "The organization does not require MFA for email access. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. A compromised email account can lead to further internal system access, data exfiltration, and business email compromise (BEC) scams.",

                        "Overview": "The organization does not require MFA for computer logins. This leaves employee workstations vulnerable to unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or guessed. Local system compromise can lead to network lateral movement, data access, and malware propagation.",

                        "Overview": "The organization does not require MFA to access sensitive data systems. This is a critical security gap, as it means a single compromised credential could grant an attacker access to the most valuable and protected information, leading to severe data breaches, regulatory fines, and reputational damage.",

                        "Overview": "The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without a clear AUP, employees may not understand their responsibilities regarding company IT resources, data handling, and internet usage. This can lead to unintentional security incidents, data leakage, and non-compliance with industry regulations.",

                        "Risk": "Outdated Operating Systems (Windows 7)",
                        "Overview": "Computers are running Windows 7, which has reached its end-of-life and no longer receives security updates from Microsoft. This exposes the workstations to known and unpatched vulnerabilities, making them easy targets for exploitation by attackers. This significantly increases the risk of malware infection, data compromise, and network intrusion.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Workstations running Windows 7"

                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, immediate action is required. First, disable anonymous FTP access and either upgrade the vsftpd server to the latest stable version or replace it with a more secure file transfer solution (e.g., SFTP, SCP) that uses strong authentication and encryption. If FTP is not essential, disable the service entirely. Second, mandate and implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all critical access points, including email systems, computer logins, and especially sensitive data systems. Third, prioritize upgrading all workstations running Windows 7 to a currently supported operating system (e.g., Windows 10 or 11) and implement a regular patch management program. Fourth, develop and implement a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), ensuring all employees are trained on its contents and acknowledge their understanding. Finally, conduct regular vulnerability scans and penetration tests to proactively identify and address new security weaknesses.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks due to several critical vulnerabilities. The presence of an outdated FTP server with anonymous access, the widespread use of end-of-life operating systems (Windows 7), and a complete lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems create a highly exploitable environment. The absence of an acceptable use policy further exacerbates these risks by potentially leading to inconsistent employee behavior regarding security. While security awareness training is in place, the foundational technical and policy controls are severely lacking, indicating a low overall security readiness. Urgent action is required to address these critical gaps and improve the organization's defensive posture against modern cyber threats."
