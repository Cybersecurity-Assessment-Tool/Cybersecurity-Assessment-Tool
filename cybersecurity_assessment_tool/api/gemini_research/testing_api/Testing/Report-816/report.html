        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems, and by having an acceptable use policy and initial security awareness training for new hires. However, critical gaps exist in endpoint authentication and ongoing employee education, which could expose the organization to significant risks.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Authentication for Workstations - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for employees to log into their computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised through phishing, malware, or brute-force attacks. Without MFA, a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to an employee's workstation and potentially the internal network, leading to data breaches or system compromise.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee workstations</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inconsistent Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual training for all employees. This leaves the workforce vulnerable to evolving cyber threats, as knowledge can degrade over time and new threats emerge. Employees may become less vigilant against phishing, social engineering, and other common attack vectors, increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents and potential data exposure.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all employee computer logins. This will significantly enhance endpoint security and reduce the risk of unauthorized access via compromised credentials. Furthermore, the organization should establish a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees. This recurring training will ensure that the workforce remains informed about the latest cyber threats and best practices, thereby strengthening the human firewall against social engineering and other attack vectors. Regular updates to training content should reflect current threat landscapes.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization has made progress in certain areas of its cybersecurity posture, particularly with MFA for critical systems and initial employee training. However, the absence of MFA for computer logins and the lack of annual security awareness training for all employees represent notable vulnerabilities. Addressing these gaps is crucial for enhancing overall security readiness, protecting against common attack vectors, and fostering a more resilient security culture. Prioritizing these recommendations will significantly improve the organization's defense against evolving cyber threats.</p>
