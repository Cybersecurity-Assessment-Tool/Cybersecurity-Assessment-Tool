                "Summary": "The organization's network currently includes at least one host with an open FTP service running an outdated version of vsftpd (2.3.4) that allows anonymous login. Furthermore, the organization exhibits significant policy-level vulnerabilities, including a complete lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. There is no formal employee acceptable use policy in place, and while new employees receive security awareness training, annual training for all employees is not conducted. Workstations are also identified as running Windows 7, an operating system past its end-of-life.",

                        "Risk": "Outdated Windows Policy",
                        "Overview": "Computers are running Windows 7, which is past its end-of-life and no longer receives security updates. This exposes systems to known vulnerabilities and exploits that will not be patched, significantly increasing the risk of compromise.",

                        "Risk": "Anonymous FTP Access",
                        "Overview": "An FTP server running vsftpd 2.3.4 is configured to allow anonymous login. This configuration can lead to unauthorized access to files, data leakage, or even arbitrary file uploads if not properly secured. The vsftpd 2.3.4 version is also outdated and may contain known vulnerabilities, further exacerbating the risk to data confidentiality and integrity.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                        "Risk": "Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require MFA for email access, computer logins, or sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access in the event of credential compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing, as a single compromised password could grant full access.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy",
                        "Overview": "The lack of an acceptable use policy means there are no clear, documented guidelines for employees regarding the proper and secure use of organizational IT resources. This can lead to misuse of systems, increased risk of malware infections, data breaches due to inappropriate actions, and potential non-compliance with regulatory requirements.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Insufficient Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "While new employees receive security awareness training, the absence of annual training for all employees leaves the organization vulnerable to evolving social engineering tactics and new cyber threats. Employees may not be up-to-date on the latest best practices, increasing the likelihood of successful phishing attacks or other human-factor exploits.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "Organizational security posture"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "It is strongly recommended to immediately disable anonymous FTP access and either decommission the FTP server if not essential or secure it with strong authentication and upgrade vsftpd to the latest secure version. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical systems, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data access, to significantly enhance credential security. Develop and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy, ensuring all employees are aware of and adhere to it. Establish a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees to keep them informed about current threats and best practices. Finally, upgrade all workstations from Windows 7 to a currently supported operating system like Windows 10 or 11 to ensure ongoing security updates and patches, considering hardware upgrades if necessary.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization faces several significant cybersecurity risks, including critical vulnerabilities such as anonymous FTP access and a widespread lack of Multi-Factor Authentication. The presence of outdated operating systems and insufficient security policies, including the absence of an acceptable use policy and annual security training, further weakens the overall security posture. Immediate and comprehensive action is required to address these critical and high-severity risks to prevent potential data breaches, unauthorized access, and operational disruptions. The current security readiness is assessed as low."
