        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network includes a MySQL database (version 5.7.33) accessible via port 3306. While the organization has implemented security awareness training for all employees (new hires and annually) and maintains an acceptable use policy, there are significant gaps in authentication controls. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required for email access, but it is not mandated for logging into computers or accessing sensitive data systems, which poses a substantial risk to the overall security posture.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network, exposing the MySQL database (version 5.7.33). This allows external access to the database, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or exfiltration if not properly secured. This vulnerability was identified via an Nmap scan showing port 3306 as open and the MySQL service running.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li><li>MySQL database server</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Authentication for Computer Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to internal systems if employee credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or malware. A single compromised password could grant an attacker access to an employee's workstation and potentially the internal network. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Internal network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Authentication for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk, as compromised credentials could grant attackers direct access to confidential information, leading to severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and significant reputational damage. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases containing sensitive information</li><li>File servers with confidential data</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement robust firewall rules to restrict access to port 3306 for the MySQL database, ideally limiting access to only trusted internal IP addresses or requiring a VPN for remote access. Furthermore, immediate implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is crucial for all computer logins and, most critically, for accessing all sensitive data systems. This will significantly enhance the security posture by adding an essential layer of protection against credential compromise. Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments should also be conducted to ensure ongoing compliance and identify new threats.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security through its acceptable use policy and consistent security awareness training. However, the presence of an open MySQL port and, more critically, the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for computer logins and sensitive data systems represent severe vulnerabilities. These gaps expose the organization to a high risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. Addressing these critical authentication and network access control deficiencies should be the immediate priority to enhance the overall cybersecurity readiness.</p>
