        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan identified an open port 22 (SSH) on an active host. While the organization has implemented MFA for sensitive data systems and conducts regular security awareness training for all employees, critical security gaps exist. Specifically, there is no multi-factor authentication (MFA) required for email access or for logging into computers, significantly increasing the risk of unauthorized access through compromised credentials. An employee acceptable use policy is in place.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The system has an exposed localhost, indicating that internal services or interfaces are accessible from the network. This poses a critical risk as it could allow unauthorized access to internal resources, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or further lateral movement within the network. The specific mechanism of exposure was identified through network scanning, revealing an open port 22 (SSH).</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. If an attacker gains access to an employee's email, they could potentially access sensitive information, impersonate the employee, or launch further attacks within the organization. This vulnerability was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email System</li><li>Employee Accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This leaves employee workstations vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are stolen or guessed. A compromised computer can serve as an entry point for attackers to access internal networks, sensitive data, or deploy malware. This vulnerability was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee Workstations</li><li>Network Access Points</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately investigate and secure the exposed localhost, ensuring that internal services are not accessible from external networks. Implement strict firewall rules to restrict access to port 22 (SSH) to only necessary and authorized sources. Furthermore, the organization must prioritize the implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and computer logins across the entire organization. This will significantly enhance protection against credential-based attacks. While security awareness training and an acceptable use policy are positive steps, their effectiveness is limited without robust technical controls like MFA. Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments should also be conducted to identify and address new threats proactively.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces critical and high-severity vulnerabilities, primarily due to an exposed internal service and a significant lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for key access points such as email and computer logins. While some foundational security practices like MFA for sensitive data and security awareness training are in place, these are overshadowed by the critical gaps in access control. The organization's current security readiness is low, and immediate action is required to address these fundamental weaknesses to prevent potential data breaches and system compromises.</p>
