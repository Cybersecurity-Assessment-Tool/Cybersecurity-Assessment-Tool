        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan identified an open port 8080 with a title suggesting a 'TOP SECRET DB', though this has been confirmed as a false positive. The organization currently implements Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access but lacks it for computer logins and sensitive data systems. While an acceptable use policy is in place, there is no security awareness training for new employees or annual training for all employees, indicating significant gaps in human-centric security controls.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Port 8080 Exposure (Confirmed False Positive) - <span class="severity-Info">Info</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An Nmap scan initially identified an open port 8080 with the HTTP title 'TOP SECRET DB'. However, further analysis confirms this to be a false positive, and the port is secured, posing no active vulnerability.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Weak Authentication for Endpoints - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to internal systems if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. A single compromised password could grant an attacker access to an employee's workstation.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers</li><li>Network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Weak Authentication for Critical Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if an attacker obtains a single set of credentials. Even if email access is protected by MFA, access to the most valuable assets remains unprotected.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All sensitive data systems</li><li>Critical business applications</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Increased Human Error and Social Engineering Vulnerability (New Employees) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) due to their unfamiliarity with organizational security policies and common threats. This oversight increases the likelihood of security incidents caused by human error.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Stagnant Security Knowledge and Evolving Threat Landscape (All Employees) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. Without regular training, employees' knowledge of current threats, best practices, and organizational policies can become outdated, making them more susceptible to evolving cyber threats like advanced phishing techniques, ransomware, and insider threats.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and, critically, for all sensitive data systems. This will significantly enhance authentication security and reduce the impact of compromised credentials. Furthermore, the organization should establish a comprehensive security awareness training program. This program must include mandatory training for all new employees upon onboarding and annual refresher training for all existing employees to ensure up-to-date knowledge of cybersecurity best practices and emerging threats. While the open port 8080 was a false positive, continuous monitoring of network services is advised.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational level of security with an acceptable use policy and MFA for email. However, significant vulnerabilities exist due to the lack of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, which are critical gaps. The absence of both new hire and annual security awareness training further exposes the organization to human-centric risks. Addressing these areas is paramount to improving the overall security posture and readiness against common and advanced cyber threats.</p>
