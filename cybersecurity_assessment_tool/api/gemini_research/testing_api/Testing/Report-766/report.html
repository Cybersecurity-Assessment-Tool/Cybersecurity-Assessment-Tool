        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network infrastructure details were not provided in the scan data. However, an assessment of organizational security practices reveals significant gaps in fundamental security controls. The organization currently lacks multi-factor authentication (MFA) across critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, there is an absence of an employee acceptable use policy and no regular security awareness training for new or existing employees. These deficiencies indicate a low level of security readiness and a high susceptibility to common cyber threats.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts through credential stuffing, phishing, or brute-force attacks. Compromised email accounts can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and further lateral movement within the network. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on email access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email accounts</li><li>Email server/service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This leaves employee workstations and potentially servers vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are stolen or guessed. An attacker gaining access to a computer can compromise sensitive data, install malware, or pivot to other systems. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on computer logins.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Domain controllers</li><li>Network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive information. Without MFA, a single compromised credential can grant an attacker full access to valuable data, leading to data breaches, regulatory fines, and reputational damage. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on sensitive data systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data repositories</li><li>Databases</li><li>Cloud storage</li><li>CRM/ERP systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy (AUP). An AUP defines the proper use of organizational assets, including IT systems, networks, and data. Without clear guidelines, employees may engage in activities that inadvertently introduce security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive information. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for an acceptable use policy.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational IT assets</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of New Employee Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often unfamiliar with an organization's specific security protocols and common threats, making them prime targets for social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting). This oversight increases the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for new employee security awareness training.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network access</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Annual Security Awareness Training for All Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. Regular training is crucial to keep employees informed about evolving threats, reinforce best practices, and maintain a strong security culture. Without it, employees are more susceptible to sophisticated attacks, and the overall human firewall weakens over time. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for annual security awareness training.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network access</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, immediate implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is strongly recommended across all critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. This is a foundational control that dramatically reduces the risk of credential-based attacks. Concurrently, the organization must develop and enforce a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) to establish clear guidelines for the proper use of IT resources. Furthermore, a robust security awareness training program should be established, including mandatory training for all new employees upon onboarding and annual refresher training for all staff. These trainings should cover topics such as phishing recognition, password hygiene, data handling best practices, and incident reporting procedures. Investing in these fundamental security controls will create a more resilient defense against common cyber threats and foster a security-conscious culture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The current assessment reveals significant vulnerabilities stemming from a lack of fundamental security controls and policies. The absence of Multi-Factor Authentication across critical systems, coupled with the lack of an Acceptable Use Policy and comprehensive security awareness training, places the organization at a high risk of various cyberattacks, including unauthorized access, data breaches, and social engineering. The organization's current readiness for mitigating common cyber threats is low. Addressing these identified gaps through the recommended implementations is crucial for establishing a baseline security posture and protecting organizational assets.</p>
