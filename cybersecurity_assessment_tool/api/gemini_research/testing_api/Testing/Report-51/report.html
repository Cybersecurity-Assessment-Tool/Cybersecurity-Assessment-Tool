        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes a MySQL database on port 3306, running version 5.7.33, which presents a significant vulnerability. While multi-factor authentication (MFA) is effectively utilized for email and computer logins, a critical gap exists as MFA is not required for accessing sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy, which can lead to inconsistent security practices. Positively, the organization demonstrates a commitment to security awareness by providing training for new employees and conducting annual training for all staff.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network, exposing the database to potential unauthorized access, data breaches, and denial-of-service attacks if not properly secured. The identified version is MySQL 5.7.33, which may have known vulnerabilities if not regularly patched. This vulnerability was identified via network port scanning.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is not required for accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if primary credentials are compromised, as there is no secondary layer of verification. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not have an employee acceptable use policy. This lack of a formal policy can lead to employees engaging in activities that inadvertently compromise security, such as improper use of company resources, unauthorized software installations, or unsafe browsing habits, without clear guidelines or consequences. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational IT resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>It is strongly recommended to immediately implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted IP addresses or internal networks. For a long-term solution, consider implementing a VPN for secure remote access to the database. Furthermore, multi-factor authentication (MFA) should be extended to all sensitive data systems to enhance access control and mitigate the risk of credential compromise. The organization should also develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to define expected behavior, security responsibilities, and acceptable use of company assets.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization exhibits a mixed security posture. While strong in security awareness training and MFA for general access, critical vulnerabilities exist with an exposed MySQL database and a lack of MFA for sensitive data systems. The absence of an acceptable use policy further highlights areas for improvement in governance. Addressing these high-severity risks promptly is crucial to enhancing the overall security readiness and protecting valuable assets.</p>
