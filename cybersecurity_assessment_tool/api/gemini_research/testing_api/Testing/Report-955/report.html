        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to multi-factor authentication (MFA) across critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. This significantly enhances protection against unauthorized access. Furthermore, the organization conducts regular security awareness training for both new and existing employees, which is a positive step in fostering a security-conscious culture. However, a network scan identified an open SSH port (port 22) on a host, which, if not adequately secured, presents a potential entry point for attackers. A notable policy gap exists as the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy, which is critical for defining appropriate conduct regarding IT resources.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unsecured SSH Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH (port 22) service was detected on a host within the network. While SSH is essential for remote administration, if not properly secured with strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., key-based authentication, disabled password authentication, MFA, and rate limiting), it can be a target for brute-force attacks or unauthorized access attempts. Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized system access, data exfiltration, or complete system compromise.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host(s) with open port 22</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Policy Gap: No Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy. This policy is crucial for defining acceptable and unacceptable use of company IT resources, data, and internet access. Without clear guidelines, employees may inadvertently engage in risky behaviors (e.g., visiting malicious websites, installing unauthorized software, mishandling sensitive data) that could lead to security incidents, data breaches, or compliance violations. This policy gap increases the overall human risk factor and reduces the effectiveness of security awareness training.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Organizational security policies</li><li>All employees</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately review and secure all open SSH services. This includes implementing key-based authentication, disabling password authentication, enforcing strong password policies for any remaining password-based access, applying rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks, and ensuring all SSH servers are regularly patched and configured with the principle of least privilege. Additionally, the organization should prioritize the development and implementation of a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy. This policy should clearly outline expectations for employee conduct regarding company IT assets, data handling, internet usage, and software installation, and it should be communicated to all employees as part of their ongoing security awareness training.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization has a commendable foundation in security readiness, particularly with its widespread adoption of MFA and consistent security awareness training. However, the presence of an open SSH port represents a critical technical vulnerability that requires immediate attention. Furthermore, the absence of an Employee Acceptable Use Policy creates a significant policy gap that could lead to human-factor risks. Addressing these specific areas will further strengthen the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and reduce its exposure to potential threats.</p>
