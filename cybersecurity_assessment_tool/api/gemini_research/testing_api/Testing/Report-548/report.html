        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open port 80, indicating a web server potentially serving unencrypted content. A review of organizational security practices shows significant gaps in foundational security controls. Specifically, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for email access or computer logins, which are critical points of entry for attackers. While MFA is used for sensitive data systems, the lack thereof for everyday access points creates substantial risk. Furthermore, the absence of an employee acceptable use policy and the lack of annual security awareness training for all employees expose the organization to human-factor vulnerabilities and potential misuse of resources.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unencrypted Web Traffic - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open port 80 indicates that a web server is likely running and serving content over HTTP. This means data transmitted between users and the server is unencrypted and susceptible to eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attacks, and data tampering. Sensitive information could be intercepted, leading to data breaches or compromise of user sessions.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li><li>Web Server</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for email access. This significantly increases the risk of email account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. A compromised email account can lead to further internal system access, data exfiltration, and business email compromise (BEC) scams, posing a critical threat to the organization.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for logging into computers. This leaves internal systems vulnerable to unauthorized access if user credentials are stolen or guessed. Attackers could gain a foothold within the network, escalate privileges, and move laterally, potentially leading to widespread system compromise and data loss.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers</li><li>Network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines, employees may engage in activities that pose security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive data. This increases the likelihood of malware infections, data breaches, and compliance violations due to unmanaged employee behavior.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, there is no annual training for all employees. This means employees may not be updated on the latest threats, phishing techniques, or security best practices, making them more susceptible to social engineering attacks and less likely to identify and report suspicious activities. This creates a persistent human-factor vulnerability.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Email systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement HTTPS for all web services to encrypt traffic on port 80. Crucially, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) should be mandated for all email access and computer logins to significantly reduce the risk of account compromise and unauthorized network access. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to establish clear guidelines for technology usage and data handling. Furthermore, establish a program for mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees to ensure they are continuously updated on current threats and best security practices. Regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing should also be conducted to identify and address new weaknesses proactively.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several critical and high-severity vulnerabilities primarily stemming from a lack of robust access controls and insufficient employee security awareness. While MFA is utilized for sensitive data systems, its absence for email and computer logins, coupled with unencrypted web traffic and a lack of clear employee policies and ongoing training, indicates a significant readiness gap. Addressing these fundamental security hygiene issues is paramount to improving the organization's overall security posture and reducing its susceptibility to cyberattacks.</p>
