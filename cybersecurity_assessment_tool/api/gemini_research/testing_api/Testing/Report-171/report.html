        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open MySQL port (3306) running version 5.7.33. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for computer logins and sensitive data systems, it is not required for email access. The organization conducts security awareness training for new and existing employees annually, but currently lacks an employee acceptable use policy.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network, exposing the database service. This could allow unauthorized access to the database if not properly secured, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized data manipulation. This was identified via network port scanning.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing or brute-force attacks, as a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to an employee's email. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email access system</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This absence means there are no formal guidelines for employees regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, data, and internet access, which can lead to increased security risks, legal liabilities, and operational inefficiencies. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Organizational IT resources</li><li>Employee conduct</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted internal IP addresses or specific application servers. For long-term security, consider placing the database behind a VPN or implementing a more robust network segmentation strategy. Additionally, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) should be immediately implemented for all email access to prevent unauthorized account access. The organization should also develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to guide employee conduct regarding IT resources and data handling. Regular security awareness training should continue to reinforce these policies and best practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In conclusion, while the organization demonstrates good practices in some areas, such as MFA for sensitive systems and regular security awareness training, critical vulnerabilities remain. The open MySQL port poses a direct threat of database exposure, and the lack of MFA for email significantly elevates the risk of account compromise. Furthermore, the absence of an acceptable use policy creates a gap in governance and employee accountability. Addressing these issues through technical controls and policy implementation is crucial for enhancing the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and readiness against potential threats.</p>
