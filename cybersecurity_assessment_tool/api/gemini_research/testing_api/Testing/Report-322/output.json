            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and maintaining an employee acceptable use policy. Annual security awareness training is also conducted for all employees. However, significant gaps exist in the application of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, and there is a critical oversight in providing security awareness training for new employees upon onboarding. These areas represent key vulnerabilities that could be exploited.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Computer Login",
                        "Overview": "Without Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins, there is an increased risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised. This could lead to lateral movement within the network and access to internal resources, as a single factor (password) is insufficient to protect against modern threats. This vulnerability was identified through the organization's stated policy of not requiring MFA for computer logins.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Employee workstations",
                            "Network access points",
                            "Internal systems"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems",
                        "Overview": "The absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for sensitive data systems significantly elevates the risk of data breaches and unauthorized data access. If an attacker gains access to a user's credentials, they could directly access and exfiltrate sensitive information without an additional layer of authentication, leading to severe compliance and reputational damage. This vulnerability was identified through the organization's stated policy of not requiring MFA for sensitive data systems.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Sensitive data systems",
                            "Databases containing sensitive information",
                            "Cloud storage for sensitive data"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "No Security Awareness Training for New Employees",
                        "Overview": "New employees are often the most susceptible to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) due to unfamiliarity with organizational security policies, common threats, and internal procedures. The lack of immediate and mandatory security awareness training upon onboarding leaves a critical gap, increasing the risk of human error leading to security incidents, malware infections, or data exposure. This vulnerability was identified through the organization's stated policy of not conducting security awareness training for new employees.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All new employees",
                            "Organizational data",
                            "Network infrastructure"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and access to sensitive data systems. This will provide a crucial additional layer of security against credential theft. Furthermore, a mandatory security awareness training program must be established for all new employees, to be completed as part of their onboarding process. This training should cover common threats, organizational policies, and best practices to reduce the risk of human-factor vulnerabilities. Regular reviews of security policies and technologies should also be conducted to adapt to evolving threat landscapes.",
            "Conclusion": "While the organization has some foundational security measures in place, such as MFA for email and annual security awareness training, there are critical gaps in its readiness. The absence of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, coupled with the lack of security awareness training for new employees, exposes the organization to significant risks of unauthorized access, data breaches, and successful social engineering attacks. Addressing these vulnerabilities is paramount to improving the overall cybersecurity posture and protecting organizational assets."
