        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The network scan identified an open MySQL port (3306), indicating a potential database exposure. Organizational data reveals a significant lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA) across critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. While security awareness training is conducted for new and existing employees, these foundational security gaps significantly increase the overall risk posture.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network. This exposes the database to potential unauthorized access, data exfiltration, and service disruption. The absence of MFA across the organization further exacerbates this risk, as compromised credentials could directly lead to database compromise if not properly secured at the application layer. This was identified via network port scanning.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li><li>MySQL Database Server</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for accessing email, logging into computers, or accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or malware. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to critical systems and data. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email Systems</li><li>Employee Workstations</li><li>Sensitive Data Systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not have an employee acceptable use policy. This lack of clear guidelines for appropriate use of company IT resources, data, and internet access can lead to misuse, accidental data breaches, and increased exposure to cyber threats. Without an AUP, employees may unknowingly engage in risky behaviors, and the organization lacks a formal basis for enforcing security best practices. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All Employee Workstations</li><li>Organizational Data</li><li>Network Resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted internal IP addresses or via a secure VPN. For long-term security, consider placing the database behind a VPN or within a segmented network zone. Crucially, implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, as this is a fundamental control against credential theft. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy (AUP) to clearly define expectations for IT resource usage and reduce human-factor risks. Regular security awareness training should continue, but also incorporate specific modules on MFA importance and AUP compliance.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to an exposed database port and, more critically, a widespread absence of multi-factor authentication across key access points. The lack of an acceptable use policy further compounds these vulnerabilities by increasing the potential for human error and misuse. While security awareness training is in place, these foundational security gaps leave the organization highly susceptible to data breaches, unauthorized access, and operational disruption. Immediate action is required to implement robust technical controls and establish essential security policies to improve the overall security posture and readiness.</p>
