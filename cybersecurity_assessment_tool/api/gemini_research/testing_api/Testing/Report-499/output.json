            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, and by having an employee acceptable use policy. New employees also receive security awareness training. However, critical gaps exist, including the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems and a lack of annual security awareness training for all employees. A network scan also revealed an open SSH port (22), which, while not inherently a vulnerability, represents a potential attack surface if not adequately secured.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information should primary credentials be compromised through phishing, malware, or other means. Without a second factor, a single compromised password could lead to a data breach.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Sensitive data systems",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Insufficient Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This leaves the workforce vulnerable to evolving cyber threats such as sophisticated phishing attacks, social engineering, and malware. Without regular updates, employees may forget best practices or become unaware of new attack vectors, increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "Organizational data",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Open SSH Port (22)",
                        "Overview": "A network scan identified an open SSH (Secure Shell) port (22). While SSH is a legitimate and secure protocol for remote administration, an open port represents a potential attack surface. If not properly secured with strong authentication (e.g., key-based authentication, strong passwords), rate limiting, and restricted access (e.g., IP whitelisting), it can be targeted by brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or exploited for known SSH vulnerabilities, potentially leading to unauthorized remote access.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Network perimeter",
                            "Server hosting SSH service"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems immediately to prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are stolen. Furthermore, establish and enforce a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees to ensure they are continuously educated on current cyber threats and best practices. For the open SSH port, ensure it is secured by enforcing key-based authentication, disabling password authentication, implementing strong access controls (e.g., IP whitelisting), and regularly monitoring logs for suspicious activity. Additionally, ensure all systems running SSH are patched and up-to-date.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization has a commendable baseline with MFA for email and computer logins, and initial security training for new hires. However, the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems and a lack of ongoing security awareness training for the entire workforce represent significant vulnerabilities that could be exploited. The open SSH port also requires immediate attention to prevent unauthorized access. Addressing these critical areas will substantially enhance the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and readiness against potential threats."
