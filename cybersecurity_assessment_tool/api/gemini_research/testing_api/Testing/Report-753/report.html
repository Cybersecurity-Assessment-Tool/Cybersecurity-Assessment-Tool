        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan identified an open port 8080, which was subsequently confirmed as a false positive and secured. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is utilized for email and computer logins, a critical security gap exists as MFA is not mandated for accessing sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization lacks fundamental security policies and training programs, specifically an employee acceptable use policy, and comprehensive security awareness training for both new and existing employees. These deficiencies highlight a significant reliance on technical controls without adequate human and policy-based safeguards.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Port 8080 Status - <span class="severity-Info">Info</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Port 8080 was initially identified as open during the network scan. Subsequent investigation confirmed it to be a false positive and is now considered secure. This was identified via nmap scan and further verification.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are compromised, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication. This vulnerability was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This means there are no formal guidelines for employees regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, data, and internet access, leading to potential misuse, security breaches, and legal liabilities. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often targets for social engineering attacks and may inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities due to a lack of understanding of security best practices and company policies. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Annual Security Awareness Training for All Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not provide annual security awareness training for all employees. Regular training is crucial to keep employees updated on evolving threats (e.g., phishing, malware) and reinforce secure behaviors, making the organization more susceptible to human-factor attacks. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access. A comprehensive employee acceptable use policy should be developed and enforced to establish clear guidelines for IT resource usage. Crucially, a robust security awareness training program must be established, including mandatory training for all new hires and annual refresher training for all employees, to educate staff on current threats, secure practices, and policy adherence. Regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing should also be conducted to proactively identify and address potential weaknesses.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently exhibits a mixed security posture. While some technical controls like MFA for email and computer logins are in place, significant vulnerabilities stem from the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems and a complete lack of foundational security policies and employee training. This leaves the organization highly susceptible to social engineering attacks, insider threats, and unauthorized access to critical data. Addressing these policy and human-factor deficiencies is paramount to improving the overall security readiness and reducing the attack surface.</p>
