        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The provided network scan data was minimal, showing no open ports on the scanned host, which suggests either a secure perimeter or an incomplete scan. Organizational data indicates a strong stance on multi-factor authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, alongside an acceptable use policy. However, a critical gap exists in employee security awareness training, which is not conducted for new employees or annually for all staff.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently does not conduct security awareness training for new employees nor does it provide annual training for all employees. This significantly increases the risk of successful social engineering attacks, phishing campaigns, and human error leading to data breaches or system compromise. Employees who are not regularly educated on current threats and best security practices are more likely to fall victim to malicious activities, inadvertently exposing sensitive information or introducing malware into the network. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational security policy questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>It is strongly recommended that the organization implement a comprehensive security awareness training program. This program should include mandatory training for all new hires covering essential security practices, common threats like phishing and social engineering, and the organization's acceptable use policy. Additionally, annual refresher training should be conducted for all employees to keep them informed about evolving threats and reinforce security best practices. Regular simulated phishing exercises could also be introduced to test employee vigilance and provide targeted education.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization demonstrates a commendable commitment to security through the widespread implementation of multi-factor authentication and an acceptable use policy, the absence of a robust security awareness training program represents a significant vulnerability. Addressing this gap is crucial to fortify the human element of the organization's defenses and significantly reduce the overall risk of security incidents.</p>
