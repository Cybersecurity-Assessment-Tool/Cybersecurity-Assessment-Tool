        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan identified an open port 8080, which was subsequently assessed and confirmed to be secure. However, a review of organizational data indicates significant gaps in security policies and controls. Specifically, the organization lacks multi-factor authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems, an employee acceptable use policy, and security awareness training for new employees. While annual security training is conducted, the absence of initial training for new hires and critical MFA implementations poses substantial risks to the organization's security posture.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee inboxes through phishing or credential stuffing attacks, potentially leading to business email compromise and data exfiltration. This vulnerability was identified from the organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not mandated for logging into systems containing sensitive data. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are compromised, posing a severe risk of data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and reputational damage. This vulnerability was identified from the organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not have an employee acceptable use policy (AUP). Without a clear AUP, employees may engage in activities that inadvertently introduce security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling company data, leading to increased exposure to malware and data loss. This vulnerability was identified from the organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee workstations</li><li>Network resources</li><li>Data handling practices</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training upon joining the organization. This leaves them susceptible to common social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) and unaware of critical security protocols from the outset, increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents. This vulnerability was identified from the organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, the organization should immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and sensitive data systems to significantly enhance credential security. Furthermore, a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy (AUP) must be developed and enforced to establish clear guidelines for secure technology usage. It is also crucial to introduce mandatory security awareness training for all new employees during their onboarding process, complementing the existing annual training program, to ensure a foundational understanding of cybersecurity best practices from day one.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to critical gaps in its security policies and controls, particularly concerning Multi-Factor Authentication for email and sensitive data access, and the absence of foundational security awareness training for new hires and an acceptable use policy. While a network scan identified no active technical vulnerabilities requiring immediate remediation, these policy-level deficiencies create a substantial attack surface that could be exploited through social engineering or compromised credentials, underscoring an urgent need for strategic security enhancements to improve overall readiness.</p>
