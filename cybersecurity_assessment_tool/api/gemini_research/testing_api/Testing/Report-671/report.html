        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization currently has a mixed security posture. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required for email and sensitive data systems, it is notably absent for computer logins, creating a significant vulnerability for internal access. Furthermore, the organization lacks fundamental security practices, including an employee acceptable use policy and any form of security awareness training for both new and existing employees. Network scans identified an active host with an open SSH port (port 22), which, if not properly secured, represents a common entry point for attackers. The overall readiness is compromised by these critical gaps in authentication, policy, and training.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Authentication for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to internal systems if credentials are compromised through phishing, malware, or other means, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication. This vulnerability was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee Workstations</li><li>Internal Network Access</li><li>User Accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Security Awareness Training and Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or annually for all employees. This leaves the organization highly susceptible to social engineering attacks, phishing, and insider threats, as employees may not be aware of best security practices or their responsibilities. This vulnerability was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All Employees</li><li>Organizational Security Posture</li><li>Data Integrity and Confidentiality</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port Exposure - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH port (port 22) was detected on an active host within the network. SSH is a common target for brute-force attacks and can lead to unauthorized access if not properly secured with strong authentication, restricted access controls, and regular patching. Its presence increases the attack surface of the network. This vulnerability was identified via network scanning.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host IP (from scan data)</li><li>Port 22</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to enhance internal system security. A comprehensive employee acceptable use policy should be developed, communicated, and enforced across the organization. Furthermore, mandatory security awareness training must be introduced for all new hires and conducted annually for all employees to educate them on cybersecurity best practices, phishing recognition, and their roles in maintaining security. For the open SSH port, it is crucial to review its necessity, restrict access to only trusted IP addresses, implement strong authentication methods (e.g., key-based authentication, MFA), disable root login, and ensure the SSH server is regularly patched and configured securely. Regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing should also be performed to identify and address new threats proactively.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to critical gaps in its authentication protocols for internal systems and a complete absence of employee security awareness training and policies. While some MFA is in place, the lack of it for computer logins, coupled with no security training or acceptable use policy, creates substantial human-factor vulnerabilities. The presence of an open SSH port further exposes the network to potential external threats. Addressing these fundamental areas is paramount to improving the organization's overall security posture and readiness against evolving cyber threats.</p>
