        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to identity and access management by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. This significantly enhances protection against unauthorized access. However, the organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees, which introduces significant human-factor risks.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently operates without a formal employee acceptable use policy. This absence means there are no clear guidelines for employees regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, data handling, internet usage, and security protocols. This lack of policy can lead to inconsistent employee behavior, increased risk of data breaches, malware infections, and non-compliance with industry regulations. It was identified through the organizational data provided, which explicitly states 'Does your organization have an employee acceptable use policy?':'No'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This oversight leaves the workforce vulnerable to evolving cyber threats such as phishing, social engineering, and malware. Regular training is crucial to keep employees informed about current threats and best practices, reinforcing a strong security culture. Without it, employees may become complacent or unaware of new attack vectors, increasing the likelihood of successful cyberattacks. This was identified through the organizational data provided, which explicitly states 'Does your organization do security awareness training for all employees at least once per year?':'No'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization develop and implement a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy. This policy should clearly define expectations for employee conduct regarding IT resource usage, data protection, and security responsibilities. Furthermore, the organization should establish a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees. This training should cover current threat landscapes, best practices for data handling, phishing recognition, and incident reporting procedures. Regular refreshers will ensure that the entire workforce remains vigilant and informed about evolving cyber threats.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization has a commendable foundation in identity and access management with widespread MFA implementation. However, significant vulnerabilities exist due to the absence of a formal employee acceptable use policy and the lack of annual security awareness training for all employees. Addressing these policy and training gaps is critical to strengthening the organization's overall security posture and reducing human-factor risks, thereby enhancing its readiness against potential cyber threats.</p>
