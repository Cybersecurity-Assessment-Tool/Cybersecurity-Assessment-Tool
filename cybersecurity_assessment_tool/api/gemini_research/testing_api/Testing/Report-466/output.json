        {
            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing an acceptable use policy and providing security awareness training for new employees. Additionally, multi-factor authentication (MFA) is mandated for access to sensitive data systems, which is a critical control. However, significant gaps exist in the broader application of MFA and the consistency of security awareness training across the entire workforce.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Email Access",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require multi-factor authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee inboxes through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks. Compromised email accounts can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and further lateral movement within the network. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational security policy review.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Email systems",
                            "Employee accounts"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Computer Login",
                        "Overview": "Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is not required for logging into organizational computers. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are stolen or guessed. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to a workstation, potentially leading to network compromise, data theft, or malware deployment. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational security policy review.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Workstations",
                            "Servers (if applicable for direct login)",
                            "Employee accounts"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Insufficient Recurring Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This lack of recurring training means that employees may not be updated on the latest threats, best practices, or changes in organizational policy, leading to a degradation of security posture over time. A consistent training program is crucial for maintaining a vigilant and informed workforce against evolving cyber threats. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational security policy review.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "Organizational security culture"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all email access and computer logins. This critical step will significantly enhance protection against credential-based attacks. Furthermore, a comprehensive and mandatory annual security awareness training program should be established for all employees. This training should cover current threat landscapes, phishing recognition, strong password practices, and incident reporting procedures to ensure a consistently informed and resilient workforce.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces significant risks due to the absence of multi-factor authentication for email and computer logins, alongside a lack of recurring security awareness training for its entire workforce. While some foundational security practices are in place, these critical gaps leave the organization vulnerable to common and impactful cyber threats. Addressing these vulnerabilities by implementing universal MFA and consistent annual training is paramount to improving the overall cybersecurity readiness and protecting sensitive assets."
