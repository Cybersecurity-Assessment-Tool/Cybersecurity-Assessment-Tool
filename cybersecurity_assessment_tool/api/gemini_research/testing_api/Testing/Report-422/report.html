        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently presents several security vulnerabilities. An Nmap scan identified an open FTP service (vsftpd 2.3.4) allowing anonymous login, which poses a significant risk for unauthorized data access or manipulation. Internally, workstations are running an outdated Windows 7 operating system, which is no longer supported and lacks critical security updates. While the organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems, it is notably absent for computer logins. Furthermore, although annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees and an acceptable use policy is in place, new employees do not receive initial security awareness training, leaving a gap in their early understanding of security best practices.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Anonymous FTP Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The FTP service (vsftpd version 2.3.4) on port 21 is configured to allow anonymous login. This configuration can lead to unauthorized access to files, potential data exfiltration, or the uploading of malicious content. This vulnerability was identified via an Nmap scan using the 'ftp-anon' script.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>FTP server (port 21)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Windows Operating System - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Workstations within the organization are running Windows 7, an operating system that has reached its end-of-life. This means it no longer receives security updates, making these systems highly susceptible to known vulnerabilities and exploits, significantly increasing the risk of compromise. This risk was identified through internal assessment data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to internal systems and data if employee credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or other means, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication. This was identified from organizational policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate New Employee Security Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive dedicated security awareness training upon joining the organization. This gap means new hires may not be immediately aware of critical security policies, common threats (like phishing), or best practices, making them more vulnerable to social engineering attacks and increasing the overall human risk factor for the organization. This was identified from organizational policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately disable anonymous FTP access and update the vsftpd service to a currently supported version, ensuring secure configurations are applied. All workstations running Windows 7 should be upgraded to a supported operating system, such as Windows 10 or 11, to ensure they receive critical security updates. Implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins is crucial to enhance protection against credential compromise. Furthermore, a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees should be established to ensure they are educated on security best practices from day one. The existing annual security awareness training and acceptable use policy should continue to be enforced and regularly reviewed.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant security challenges, primarily stemming from an exposed FTP service, outdated operating systems on workstations, and a lack of MFA for computer logins. While some security measures like MFA for sensitive systems and annual training are in place, the identified vulnerabilities, particularly the lack of initial security training for new employees, indicate a need for immediate and comprehensive security enhancements to improve the overall readiness and reduce the attack surface.</p>
