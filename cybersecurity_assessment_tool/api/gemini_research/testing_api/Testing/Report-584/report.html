        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to cybersecurity through its employee acceptable use policy and regular security awareness training for all staff. However, critical vulnerabilities exist in identity and access management, specifically the absence of multi-factor authentication (MFA) for email access and computer logins. A basic network scan also revealed an open port 80, indicating a potential web service that could be a vector for attack if not properly secured.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee inboxes through credential stuffing, phishing, or brute-force attacks. Compromised email accounts can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and further internal network compromise. This was identified from the organizational data indicating "Do you require MFA to access email?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>all user email accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not enforced for logging into organizational computers. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are stolen or guessed. A compromised computer can serve as a pivot point for attackers to move laterally within the network, access sensitive data, or deploy malware. This was identified from the organizational data indicating "Do you require MFA to log into computers?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All organizational computers</li><li>user endpoints</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open Port 80 (HTTP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A network scan identified an open port 80 (HTTP) on a host within the network. While this may be intentional for a web service, HTTP transmits data in plain text, making it susceptible to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. Furthermore, any web application running on this port could have vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQL injection, outdated software) that an attacker could exploit. This was identified from the Nmap scan data showing portid":"80","state":"open".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with open port 80</li><li>any web server or application running on port 80</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and computer logins as a top priority. This will drastically reduce the risk of credential-based attacks. For the identified open port 80, it is crucial to assess the purpose of the service running on it. If a web service is necessary, it should be secured with HTTPS (port 443) using a valid SSL/TLS certificate, and the underlying web application should be regularly patched, configured securely, and subjected to vulnerability assessments. If the service is not required, the port should be closed or filtered.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has established a good foundation with security awareness training and an acceptable use policy, significant vulnerabilities exist due to the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for critical access points like email and computer logins. The presence of an open HTTP port also presents a potential attack surface. Addressing these high-severity risks by implementing MFA and securing web services is paramount to improving the overall cybersecurity readiness and protecting against common attack vectors.</p>
