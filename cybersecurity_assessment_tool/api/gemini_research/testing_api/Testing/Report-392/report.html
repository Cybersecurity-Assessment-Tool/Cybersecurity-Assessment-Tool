        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open port 80, indicating potential unencrypted web traffic. Organizational policies show a significant lack of multi-factor authentication for computer logins, absence of an employee acceptable use policy, and no regular security awareness training for employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unencrypted Web Traffic - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open port 80 was detected, typically used for unencrypted HTTP communication. This allows sensitive data transmitted over this port to be intercepted and read by attackers, leading to data breaches or unauthorized access. Identified via Nmap scan.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li><li>Web Server</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Weak Authentication for Computers - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or guessed, as a single factor (password) is insufficient to protect against modern threats. Identified from organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This absence can lead to employees engaging in risky online behaviors, misusing company resources, or inadvertently introducing malware, as there are no clear guidelines for appropriate conduct. Identified from organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational network resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Low Security Awareness - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or annually for all employees. This leaves employees vulnerable to social engineering attacks (phishing, pretexting), malware, and other common threats, as they may not recognize or report suspicious activities. Identified from organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data and systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>It is strongly recommended to implement HTTPS for all web services running on port 80 to encrypt data in transit. Immediately enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to enhance authentication security. Develop and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to guide appropriate conduct and reduce insider risks. Furthermore, establish mandatory security awareness training for all new hires and conduct annual refresher training for all employees to improve overall human firewall effectiveness.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks stemming from both technical configurations and policy gaps. Key vulnerabilities include unencrypted web traffic, weak authentication for computer logins due to the lack of MFA, and a general lack of security awareness and policy enforcement among employees. Addressing these areas is critical to improving the organization's overall security posture and readiness against common cyber threats.</p>
