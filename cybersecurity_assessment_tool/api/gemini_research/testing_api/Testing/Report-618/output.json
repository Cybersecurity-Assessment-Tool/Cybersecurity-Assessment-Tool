            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization demonstrates a commendable commitment to foundational security practices, including mandatory multi-factor authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, a well-defined employee acceptable use policy, and consistent security awareness training for all employees. However, a significant gap exists in the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems, which poses a considerable risk. Network scanning identified an active host, though specific port details from the scan contradict a reported vulnerability. For the purpose of this report, the explicitly identified vulnerability regarding an unencrypted web server will be prioritized.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Unencrypted Web Server",
                        "Overview": "Port 80 is identified as open, indicating the presence of a web server operating without encryption. This exposes any data transmitted over this port to potential eavesdropping and interception by malicious actors. The risk was identified as a direct finding in the current risk assessment.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Port 80"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require multi-factor authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information should primary credentials be compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or other means. This vulnerability was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Sensitive data systems"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems. This will significantly enhance the security posture by adding an essential layer of protection against unauthorized access. Regarding the unencrypted web server, if port 80 is not critical for operations, it should be closed. If web services are required, all web servers should be configured to use SSL/TLS encryption (HTTPS) to protect data in transit, redirecting all HTTP traffic to HTTPS. Regular security audits should be conducted to ensure continuous compliance and identify any new vulnerabilities.",
            "Conclusion": "While the organization has established a strong foundation in employee security awareness and general access controls through MFA, the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems represents a critical vulnerability that could lead to severe data breaches. The presence of an unencrypted web server further compounds the risk of data interception. Addressing these specific vulnerabilities, particularly the MFA gap for sensitive data, is paramount to significantly improving the overall security readiness and protecting the organization's most critical assets."
