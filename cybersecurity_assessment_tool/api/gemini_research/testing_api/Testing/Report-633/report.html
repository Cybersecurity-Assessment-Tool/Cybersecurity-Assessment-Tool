        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan identified an open port 8080, which was subsequently confirmed as secured and a false positive. However, a review of organizational data revealed several critical security gaps. Specifically, the organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive data systems, lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy (AUP), and does not provide security awareness training for new employees. While annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees, the absence of initial training for new hires and the lack of MFA for sensitive data represent significant vulnerabilities.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if primary credentials are compromised, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication. The impact could be a data breach or unauthorized modification of sensitive information. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational security policy data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy (AUP). Without a clear AUP, employees may be unaware of the proper and improper use of company IT resources, leading to potential misuse, security breaches, or non-compliance with regulatory requirements. This increases the risk of insider threats and accidental data exposure. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational policy data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational IT resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often a vulnerable entry point for social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) if they are not immediately educated on security best practices, common threats, and organizational policies. This increases the risk of successful social engineering attacks and internal security incidents. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational training data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance its security posture, the organization should prioritize the immediate implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems. This will provide a crucial layer of defense against unauthorized access. Concurrently, a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy (AUP) must be developed, communicated, and enforced across the entire organization to establish clear guidelines for IT resource usage. Furthermore, a mandatory security awareness training program specifically for new employees should be integrated into the onboarding process to ensure all staff are equipped with essential cybersecurity knowledge from their first day.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several notable cybersecurity risks, primarily stemming from gaps in access control for sensitive data, policy enforcement, and initial employee training. While some security measures are in place, the absence of MFA for sensitive systems, a formal AUP, and new employee security training leaves the organization vulnerable to data breaches and operational disruptions. Addressing these identified areas is crucial for improving overall security readiness and protecting critical assets.</p>
