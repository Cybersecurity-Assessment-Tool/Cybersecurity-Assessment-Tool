        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization has established a commendable baseline for security awareness, implementing an acceptable use policy and conducting regular security training for all employees, including new hires. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is in place for email and computer logins, which is a strong security practice. However, a network scan identified an open SSH port (22) on the target system. A significant gap was also noted in the protection of sensitive data systems, which currently do not require MFA for access.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A critical service intended for internal network access only (typically bound to 127.0.0.1) has been identified as externally accessible. This exposure could allow unauthorized external entities to interact with internal services, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service. The vulnerability was identified through network scanning and configuration review, indicating a severe misconfiguration.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Target IP address and associated localhost-bound services</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediate action is required to address the 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability. All services intended for internal access must be verified to be correctly bound to the localhost interface and inaccessible from external networks. A thorough review of firewall rules and service configurations is essential. Furthermore, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to align with existing security policies and prevent unauthorized access to critical information. The necessity of having SSH (port 22) open externally should be re-evaluated; if external access is indispensable, stringent security measures such as key-based authentication, MFA, and IP-based access restrictions must be enforced.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has a solid foundation in security awareness and general MFA implementation, the presence of a 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability, coupled with the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems, represents critical security deficiencies. These vulnerabilities pose a high risk of unauthorized access and potential data compromise. Addressing these high-impact risks promptly is crucial for significantly enhancing the organization's overall security posture and readiness against cyber threats.</p>
