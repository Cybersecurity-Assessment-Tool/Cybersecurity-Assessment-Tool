        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan indicates that port 80 is closed. From a policy perspective, the organization requires MFA for computer logins but not for email or sensitive data systems. There is no employee acceptable use policy in place, and while new employees receive security awareness training, it is not conducted annually for all employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unencrypted Web Server - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Port 80 is open, indicating a potential for unencrypted web traffic. This could lead to sensitive data exposure if a web server were to become active on this port without proper encryption. This risk was identified as a known vulnerability within the organization's current risk assessment.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is recommended to implement SSL/TLS encryption for any web services operating on port 80, or ensure the port remains closed if no web service is intended. Furthermore, the organization should enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and sensitive data systems to enhance account security. An employee acceptable use policy should be developed and implemented to define expected behavior and responsibilities regarding IT asset usage. Finally, security awareness training should be conducted annually for all employees, not just new hires, to maintain a consistent level of security knowledge across the organization.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces a medium-severity risk related to potential unencrypted web services on port 80. Additionally, there are significant gaps in security posture concerning MFA implementation for critical systems like email and sensitive data, the absence of an acceptable use policy, and insufficient annual security awareness training for all employees. Addressing these areas is crucial for improving the overall cybersecurity readiness and reducing the attack surface.</p>
