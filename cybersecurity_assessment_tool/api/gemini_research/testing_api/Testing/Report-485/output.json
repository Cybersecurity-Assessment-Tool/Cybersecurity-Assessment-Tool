                "Summary": "The organization's network currently exposes Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) on port 3389, which is a critical vulnerability. Internally, there is a significant lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA) for both computer logins and access to sensitive data systems, increasing the risk of unauthorized access through compromised credentials. Furthermore, the organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees, which can lead to increased human-factor risks and a degradation of security posture over time. While new employees receive security training, the absence of ongoing education leaves the organization susceptible to evolving threats.",

                        "Risk": "RDP Exposure",
                        "Overview": "Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed to the internet via an open port 3389. This allows potential attackers to attempt brute-force attacks, exploit known vulnerabilities in the RDP service, or gain unauthorized access to internal systems. This was identified by an open port 3389 (ms-wbt-server) during network scanning.",

                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are compromised through phishing, malware, or other means, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication. This was identified through organizational policy review.",

                        "Overview": "Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk, as compromised credentials could grant attackers direct access to confidential information, leading to data breaches, regulatory fines, and severe reputational damage. This was identified through organizational policy review.",

                        "Risk": "Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy",
                        "Overview": "The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines, employees may engage in activities that introduce security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling company data, leading to potential malware infections or data leakage. This was identified through organizational policy review.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "While new employees receive security awareness training, there is no annual training for all employees. This means employees may not be updated on the latest threats, best practices, or changes in organizational policy, leading to a degradation of security posture over time and increased susceptibility to social engineering attacks. This was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",

                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately close port 3389 to external access and implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) for secure remote access. Furthermore, the organization must prioritize the implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and, critically, for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised. A comprehensive employee acceptable use policy should be developed, communicated, and enforced to establish clear guidelines for secure behavior. Finally, a program for annual security awareness training for all employees should be established to ensure ongoing education on current threats and best practices, reinforcing a strong security culture.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces several critical and high-severity vulnerabilities, primarily stemming from exposed RDP services and a significant lack of MFA implementation across key access points and sensitive data systems. The absence of an acceptable use policy and annual security awareness training further exacerbates the human-factor risk. While new employee training is a positive step, the overall readiness is low, requiring immediate attention to these fundamental security controls to protect against potential data breaches and unauthorized access."
