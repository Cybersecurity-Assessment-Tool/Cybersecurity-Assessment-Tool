        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently operates a web server running Nginx version 1.18.0 on port 443 (HTTPS). An assessment of organizational data reveals critical security gaps, including the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, a lack of an employee acceptable use policy, and insufficient recurring security awareness training for all employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Nginx Server - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nginx web server identified is running version 1.18.0, which is an older release. Older software versions often contain known vulnerabilities that have been patched in newer releases. For example, Nginx 1.18.0 is susceptible to CVE-2021-23017 (resolver stack buffer overflow) and other potential security flaws. Running outdated software increases the attack surface and makes the server vulnerable to exploits that could lead to data breaches, denial of service, or unauthorized access. This was identified through the network scan data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Nginx 1.18.0 web server</li><li>Port 443</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. If an attacker gains access to an employee's email, they could potentially pivot to other systems, impersonate the employee, or access sensitive information. This was identified from the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee email accounts</li><li>Email system</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for employees to log into their computers. This leaves workstations vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials (username/password) are compromised. An attacker gaining access to a computer could potentially access internal networks, sensitive data, or install malware. This was identified from the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Internal network access</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). Without an AUP, employees may be unaware of the proper and secure use of company resources, including IT systems, internet access, and data. This can lead to increased risks such as data leakage, malware infections from unauthorized software installations or website visits, and legal liabilities. This was identified from the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Data handling practices</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Recurring Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual or regular security awareness training for all employees. This means that employees may not be kept up-to-date on the latest threats, best practices, and company policies, leading to a degradation of security posture over time. Human error remains a leading cause of security incidents, and consistent training is crucial to mitigate this risk. This was identified from the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, the organization should prioritize updating its Nginx web server to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities. Implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and computer logins is critical to significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and account compromise. Furthermore, the organization must develop and implement a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) to clearly define expectations for secure behavior and resource usage. Finally, establishing a program for mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees will ensure that the workforce remains vigilant against evolving cyber threats and adheres to security best practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several significant cybersecurity risks, primarily stemming from an outdated public-facing web server and critical gaps in its identity and access management policies, specifically the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for email and computer logins. Additionally, the absence of an Acceptable Use Policy and insufficient recurring security awareness training expose the organization to increased risks from human error and misuse of resources. Addressing these vulnerabilities is crucial for enhancing the overall security posture and reducing the likelihood of a successful cyberattack.</p>
