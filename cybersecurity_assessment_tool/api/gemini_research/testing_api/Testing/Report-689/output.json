                "Summary": "The organization's network scan revealed an open Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) port (3389), indicating potential external exposure. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is used for email access, it is not mandated for computer logins or sensitive data systems. The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct security awareness training for new employees, although annual training is provided for all staff.",

                        "Overview": "Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) port 3389 was found to be open and accessible. This exposes the organization to potential brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, and unauthorized access attempts, which could lead to system compromise and data breaches. The vulnerability was identified through a network port scan.",

                        "Risk": "Insufficient Authentication for Computers",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication. This was identified through organizational policy review.",

                        "Overview": "Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if user credentials are compromised, potentially leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and reputational damage. This was identified through organizational policy review.",

                        "Risk": "Lack of Employee Acceptable Use Policy",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not have an employee acceptable use policy. This absence creates ambiguity regarding acceptable conduct, use of company resources, and security responsibilities, increasing the risk of misuse, data leakage, and non-compliance with security best practices. This was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Incomplete Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. This means new hires may not be immediately aware of critical security policies, common threats (e.g., phishing), and their role in maintaining security, making them more susceptible to social engineering attacks and accidental security incidents. This was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "New employees",

                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately close the open RDP port (3389) to external access. For legitimate remote access, implement a secure Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution with strong authentication. Furthermore, implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and access to sensitive data systems to significantly enhance credential security. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to clearly define expected behavior and security responsibilities. Finally, establish mandatory security awareness training for all new employees upon onboarding, in addition to the existing annual training, to ensure a consistent baseline of security knowledge across the organization.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces critical security vulnerabilities, primarily due to an exposed RDP service and insufficient authentication controls for internal systems and sensitive data. While some security practices are in place (MFA for email, annual security training), the lack of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data, absence of an acceptable use policy, and incomplete new employee security training indicate significant gaps in the overall security posture. Addressing these issues is crucial to enhance the organization's readiness against cyber threats and protect its assets."
