        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and provides security awareness training for new employees. However, critical security gaps persist, including the absence of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, a lack of an employee acceptable use policy, and insufficient recurring security awareness training for all personnel.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for employees to log into their computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication. An attacker gaining access to a workstation could potentially move laterally within the network, escalating privileges and accessing sensitive resources.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network access points</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not enforced for accessing sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk, as compromised credentials could grant direct, unfettered access to confidential information. Such a breach could lead to severe data loss, regulatory non-compliance (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA), significant financial penalties, and severe reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>Cloud storage</li><li>Critical applications</li><li>Data repositories</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy (AUP). Without a clear AUP, employees may be unaware of their responsibilities regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, data handling procedures, and internet usage guidelines. This absence can lead to increased risks such as data leakage, malware infections from unauthorized software, and non-compliance with security best practices due to unmanaged employee behavior.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Data assets</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Recurring Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive initial security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual or regular security awareness training for all employees. This means that personnel may not be updated on the latest cyber threats, evolving phishing techniques, or changes in company security policies. Over time, this can lead to a degradation of the overall security posture as initial training knowledge fades or becomes outdated, increasing susceptibility to social engineering attacks.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security culture</li><li>Incident response readiness</li><li>Email systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance its security posture, the organization must prioritize the immediate implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and, critically, for access to all sensitive data systems. Concurrently, a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy (AUP) should be developed, communicated, and enforced to clearly define expected behavior and responsibilities regarding IT resource usage and data handling. Furthermore, a robust and mandatory program for recurring security awareness training for all employees, conducted at least annually, must be established to ensure continuous education on current threats, phishing tactics, and evolving security best practices. Regular reviews and updates of security policies and procedures are also recommended to maintain an adaptive defense against emerging cyber threats.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently operates with a mixed security posture, demonstrating some foundational security practices such as MFA for email and initial new hire training. However, significant vulnerabilities exist due to critical gaps, including the absence of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, a missing acceptable use policy, and a lack of continuous security awareness training. Addressing these identified risks is paramount to strengthening the organization's overall readiness against cyber threats, protecting sensitive assets, and ensuring long-term operational resilience.</p>
