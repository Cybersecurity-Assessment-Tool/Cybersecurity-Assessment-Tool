        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open port 22 (SSH), indicating a potential entry point. Furthermore, the organization currently lacks critical security controls, including Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. There is no established employee acceptable use policy, and while security awareness training is provided for new employees, it is not conducted annually for all staff. These findings suggest a low overall security readiness and significant vulnerabilities that could be exploited.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A critical misconfiguration has been identified where a service or interface intended for local access (localhost) is exposed to external networks. This allows potential attackers to directly interact with internal services, bypassing perimeter defenses. Such exposure can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or complete system compromise, especially if the exposed service has vulnerabilities or weak authentication. This risk was identified through a security assessment revealing an unexpected external reachability of an internal resource.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>External-facing IP address of the affected system</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediate action is required to mitigate the 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability by reviewing network configurations, firewall rules, and service bindings to ensure internal services are not externally accessible. Additionally, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, to significantly enhance authentication security. The organization should also develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy and establish a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees to foster a stronger security culture and reduce human-factor risks.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces critical security risks, primarily due to an exposed internal service and a significant lack of fundamental security controls such as MFA and a formal acceptable use policy. While new employee security training is a positive step, the absence of annual training for all staff and other critical safeguards leaves the organization highly vulnerable to cyber threats. Addressing these identified vulnerabilities and implementing the recommended security measures is paramount to improving the overall security posture and readiness.</p>
