        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan identified an open port 8080 with a 'TOP SECRET DB' title, which was subsequently confirmed as a false positive and secured. Organizational data indicates strong security practices for sensitive data systems and computer logins, both requiring Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). An acceptable use policy is in place, and annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees. However, there are gaps in security posture, specifically the lack of MFA for email access and the absence of security awareness training for new employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Port 8080 False Positive - <span class="severity-Info">Info</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> During the network scan, port 8080 was identified as open with the title 'TOP SECRET DB'. However, further investigation confirmed this to be a false positive and the port is secured, posing no actual risk.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing, potentially leading to business email compromise (BEC) and data breaches. This was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email System</li><li>Employee Accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While the organization conducts annual security awareness training for all employees, new employees do not receive immediate security awareness training upon joining. This leaves new hires vulnerable to social engineering attacks, phishing, and other common cybersecurity threats during their initial period, potentially exposing the organization to risks before they are educated on best practices. This was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New Employees</li><li>Organizational Security Posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access to mitigate the risk of unauthorized account compromise. Additionally, a mandatory security awareness training program should be established for all new employees as part of their onboarding process to ensure they are immediately equipped with essential cybersecurity knowledge and best practices. While port 8080 was a false positive, continuous monitoring of network services is advised.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational level of security readiness with MFA for sensitive systems and annual employee training. However, critical vulnerabilities exist in the lack of MFA for email and the absence of initial security awareness training for new employees. Addressing these gaps is crucial for bolstering the overall cybersecurity defense and reducing the attack surface against common threats.</p>
