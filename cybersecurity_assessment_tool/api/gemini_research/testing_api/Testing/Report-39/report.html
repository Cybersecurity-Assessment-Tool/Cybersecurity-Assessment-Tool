        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network assessment revealed a critical vulnerability: an open MySQL database (version 5.7.33) accessible via port 3306. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for email and sensitive data systems, it is notably absent for computer logins, posing a significant risk. Furthermore, the organization lacks essential security awareness training for both new and existing employees, despite having an palatable use policy in place. These findings indicate a need for immediate attention to critical network exposures and foundational security practices.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network, exposing a MySQL database (version 5.7.33). This allows external entities to potentially connect to and interact with the database, leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, or service disruption if not properly secured. The vulnerability was identified through network scanning.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li><li>MySQL Database (version 5.7.33)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to internal systems and data if employee credentials (usernames and passwords) are compromised through phishing, malware, or other means. A single factor of authentication is insufficient to protect against modern threat vectors. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Internal network access points</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees, nor does it provide annual training for all employees. This leaves the workforce vulnerable to social engineering attacks, phishing attempts, and other human-centric threats. A lack of awareness can lead to employees inadvertently introducing malware, clicking malicious links, or disclosing sensitive information, thereby compromising the organization's security posture. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li><li>Email systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, immediate action is required. Firstly, implement strict firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted internal IP addresses or via a secure VPN. For long-term security, consider placing the database behind a VPN or within a segmented network. Secondly, mandate and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins across the organization to significantly enhance protection against credential theft. Lastly, establish and implement a comprehensive security awareness training program. This program should include mandatory training for all new hires and annual refresher courses for all employees, covering topics such as phishing recognition, password hygiene, and data handling best practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The current cybersecurity assessment reveals critical vulnerabilities, including an exposed MySQL database, a lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for computer logins, and the absence of a formal security awareness training program. While some security measures like MFA for email and sensitive data systems are in place, these gaps significantly lower the organization's overall security readiness. Addressing these issues promptly is crucial to protect against potential data breaches, unauthorized access, and social engineering attacks, thereby strengthening the organization's defense against evolving cyber threats.</p>
