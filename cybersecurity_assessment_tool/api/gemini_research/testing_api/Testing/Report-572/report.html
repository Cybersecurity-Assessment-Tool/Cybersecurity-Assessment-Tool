        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open port 80, indicating an unencrypted web service. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for email and computer logins, a critical gap exists as MFA is not required for accessing sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization lacks fundamental security practices, including an employee acceptable use policy and any form of security awareness training for both new and existing employees. These deficiencies highlight significant vulnerabilities in both technical controls and human-centric security measures.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Authentication for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if primary credentials are compromised (e.g., via phishing, brute-force, or credential stuffing attacks). Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to sensitive data, leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and reputational damage. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating no MFA for sensitive data systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). An AUP defines the proper and acceptable use of organizational IT resources, including networks, systems, software, and data. Without a clear AUP, employees may inadvertently or intentionally misuse company resources, engage in risky online behaviors, or expose the organization to legal liabilities, malware infections, or data loss. This absence creates ambiguity regarding expected employee conduct and makes it difficult to enforce security standards, identified through the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational IT resources</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient New Employee Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) as they may be less familiar with organizational security protocols, common threats, and reporting procedures. Without initial training, new employees pose an elevated risk of falling victim to attacks that could compromise organizational systems or data, leading to breaches or operational disruptions. This was identified through the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Email systems</li><li>Internal networks</li><li>Sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Regular Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not provide annual security awareness training for all employees. Cybersecurity threats constantly evolve, and regular training is crucial to keep employees informed about the latest attack vectors, best practices, and organizational policies. Without recurring training, employees' security knowledge can become outdated, increasing their susceptibility to sophisticated phishing campaigns, malware, and other social engineering tactics. This oversight weakens the human firewall, making the organization more vulnerable to breaches, identified through the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Email systems</li><li>Internal networks</li><li>Sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unencrypted Web Service Exposure - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A network scan identified an open port 80, indicating an unencrypted HTTP web service is accessible. Transmitting data over HTTP leaves it vulnerable to eavesdropping, tampering, and man-in-the-middle attacks, as all communication is in plain text. This could expose sensitive information (e.g., login credentials, personal data) if the service handles such data, or it could be a vector for injecting malicious content. While not inherently critical if only static, non-sensitive content is served, it's a common entry point for further reconnaissance or exploitation if not properly secured or if it hosts vulnerable applications. This was identified via the Nmap scan data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with open port 80</li><li>Web server application</li><li>Network traffic</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access. Develop and enforce a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) to clearly define expectations for IT resource usage and reduce misuse. Establish and regularly conduct security awareness training programs for all employees, starting with new hires and continuing with annual refreshers for the entire workforce, to educate them on current threats and best practices. For the open port 80, assess the service running on it; if it handles any sensitive data, encrypt the traffic using HTTPS (port 443) and redirect all HTTP traffic. If the service is not critical, consider closing the port or restricting access to only necessary internal IP ranges.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks stemming from both technical vulnerabilities and a lack of foundational security policies and training. While MFA is in place for some areas, its absence for sensitive data systems is a critical oversight. The complete lack of an AUP and security awareness training leaves the organization highly susceptible to human-centric attacks and internal misuse. Addressing these issues is paramount to improving the overall security posture and readiness against evolving cyber threats.</p>
