        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>A network scan identified an open port 8080 with a 'TOP SECRET DB' title, which was subsequently confirmed as a false positive and not a security risk. However, a review of organizational data revealed critical gaps in security posture, specifically the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across key systems, a lack of an employee acceptable use policy, and no formal security awareness training programs for new or existing employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. Compromised email accounts can lead to further internal system breaches, data exfiltration, and business email compromise (BEC) scams. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>All employee email accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for logging into computers. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or guessed. A compromised computer can serve as an entry point for lateral movement within the network, malware deployment, and access to sensitive internal resources. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All organizational computers</li><li>Network access</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for accessing sensitive data systems. This poses a severe risk to the confidentiality and integrity of critical business information. Without MFA, a single compromised credential can grant an attacker full access to sensitive databases, intellectual property, or customer data, leading to data breaches, regulatory fines, and reputational damage. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>Intellectual property</li><li>Customer data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without a clear AUP, employees may unknowingly engage in activities that introduce security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling company data. This absence creates ambiguity regarding expected behavior and makes it difficult to enforce security best practices, increasing the likelihood of insider threats and accidental data exposure. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational network</li><li>Data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) as they may be less familiar with company security protocols and common threats. This oversight leaves the organization vulnerable to initial access breaches through newly onboarded staff, potentially compromising credentials or introducing malware. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational network</li><li>Data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Annual Security Awareness Training for All Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. Regular training is crucial to keep employees informed about evolving threats, reinforce security best practices, and maintain a strong security culture. The absence of annual training leads to a decline in security vigilance, making employees more susceptible to sophisticated social engineering attacks and increasing the risk of human error-induced breaches. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational network</li><li>Data</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical systems, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, as a top priority. Develop and enforce a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) to clearly define expected employee behavior regarding IT resource usage and data handling. Establish a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees during onboarding. Implement annual security awareness training for all existing employees to ensure continuous education on evolving threats and best practices. Regularly review and update security policies and training materials to reflect current threat landscapes.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to a lack of fundamental security controls. The absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, combined with a complete lack of security awareness training and an acceptable use policy, creates a highly vulnerable environment. While a specific network port (8080) was initially flagged but later confirmed as a false positive, the human and policy-related vulnerabilities present a critical and immediate threat to the organization's data integrity, confidentiality, and overall operational resilience. Addressing these foundational weaknesses is paramount to improving the organization's security posture and readiness against cyber threats.</p>
