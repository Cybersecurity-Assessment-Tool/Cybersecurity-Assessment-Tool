            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security best practices by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and sensitive data systems, and maintaining an annual security awareness training program for all employees. An acceptable use policy is also in place. However, a significant gap exists in the absence of MFA for email access, which is a common vector for phishing and account compromise. Additionally, new employees do not receive dedicated security awareness training upon onboarding, potentially leaving them vulnerable to social engineering attacks during their initial period.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Email Access",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. Email is a primary communication channel and a frequent target for phishing attacks. Without MFA, a compromised password (e.g., via phishing or credential stuffing) grants an attacker full access to an employee's email, potentially leading to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, or further lateral movement within the network. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employee email accounts",
                            "Email server/service"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "No Security Awareness Training for New Employees",
                        "Overview": "New employees do not receive dedicated security awareness training upon onboarding. While annual training is conducted for all employees, the initial period for new hires is critical for establishing secure habits and understanding organizational policies. Without immediate training, new employees may be more susceptible to social engineering, phishing, and other common cyber threats, increasing the risk of human error leading to security incidents. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All new employees",
                            "Onboarding process"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts across the organization. This critical step will significantly enhance protection against credential theft and unauthorized access. Furthermore, a mandatory security awareness training program should be integrated into the onboarding process for all new employees, ensuring they are equipped with essential cybersecurity knowledge from day one. This initial training should cover topics such as phishing recognition, password hygiene, and acceptable use policies, complementing the existing annual training for all staff.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization has established a reasonable security posture in several areas, including MFA for critical systems and annual security training. However, the absence of MFA for email access represents a critical vulnerability that could lead to severe consequences if exploited. The lack of initial security awareness training for new employees also presents a notable gap. Addressing these specific areas will significantly enhance the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and reduce its attack surface."
