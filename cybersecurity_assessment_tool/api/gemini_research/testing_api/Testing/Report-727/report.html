        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's external network footprint appears minimal, with only SSH (port 22) identified as open. Internally, while Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for email access, it is notably absent for computer logins and sensitive data systems, increasing the risk of unauthorized access. Furthermore, the lack of an employee acceptable use policy and specific security awareness training for new hires indicates gaps in foundational security practices, despite annual training for all employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Authentication for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication. This was identified from the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers</li><li>Internal network access</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Authentication for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk to data confidentiality and integrity, as compromised credentials could grant direct access to sensitive information without an additional layer of security. This was identified from the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>File shares</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This absence creates ambiguity regarding expected employee behavior when using company IT resources, increasing the risk of misuse, data breaches, and non-compliance with security standards due to undefined boundaries and responsibilities. This was identified from the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>IT systems</li><li>Organizational data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Incomplete Security Awareness Training Program - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees, new employees do not receive specific training upon onboarding. This leaves new hires vulnerable to social engineering attacks and unaware of critical security protocols during their initial period, potentially exposing the organization to risks before they receive general training. This was identified from the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>IT systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH (port 22) service was detected on the external network. While SSH is a legitimate service, an exposed port represents a potential entry point for attackers attempting brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or exploiting known SSH vulnerabilities if the service is not properly secured (e.g., strong passwords, key-based authentication, rate limiting, up-to-date software). This was identified via Nmap scan.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>External-facing server with port 22 open</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and sensitive data systems, mirroring the current practice for email access. Developing and enforcing a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy is crucial to establish clear guidelines for IT resource usage and mitigate misuse risks. Furthermore, a mandatory security awareness training program should be introduced for all new employees during their onboarding process to ensure immediate adherence to security best practices. For the identified open SSH port, ensure robust security measures are in place, including strong, unique credentials, key-based authentication where feasible, rate limiting, and regular patching of the SSH service. Consider restricting access to this port via firewall rules to only trusted IP addresses.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The cybersecurity assessment reveals that while the external network footprint appears limited with only an open SSH port, the organization faces significant internal and procedural security vulnerabilities. Critical gaps exist in the implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication for computer logins and sensitive data systems, posing a substantial risk of unauthorized access. The absence of an employee acceptable use policy and dedicated security awareness training for new hires further weakens the overall security posture. Addressing these foundational policy and authentication weaknesses is paramount to improving the organization's readiness against modern cyber threats.</p>
