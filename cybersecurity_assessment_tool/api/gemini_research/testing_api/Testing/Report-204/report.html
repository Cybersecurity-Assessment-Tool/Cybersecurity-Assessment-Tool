        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, and conducts annual security awareness training for all employees. However, there are notable gaps in security posture, specifically regarding access to sensitive data systems and the onboarding process for new employees. The provided network scan data and current vulnerabilities data were broken and could not be processed for a comprehensive technical assessment.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Access Control for Sensitive Data - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if primary credentials are compromised (e.g., via phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing). An attacker gaining access to a single set of credentials could potentially access sensitive data without an additional layer of security. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Untrained New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees upon onboarding. New employees, unfamiliar with the organization's specific security policies, common threat vectors (like phishing), and best practices, are more susceptible to social engineering attacks and may inadvertently introduce security risks. This gap leaves the organization vulnerable during a critical period when employees are learning their roles and the organizational environment. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li><li>Email systems (phishing)</li><li>Internal networks</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization implements mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to enhance access control and protect against credential compromise. Additionally, a comprehensive security awareness training program should be established for all new employees as part of their onboarding process, covering topics such as phishing, password hygiene, data handling, and incident reporting. Regular review and updates of security policies and training materials are also advised to address the evolving threat landscape.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing MFA for email and computer logins and conducting annual security awareness training for existing employees. However, significant gaps exist in the protection of sensitive data systems, which currently lack MFA, and in the onboarding process for new employees, who do not receive initial security awareness training. Addressing these vulnerabilities is crucial to bolstering the overall security posture and reducing the risk of unauthorized access and human-factor related incidents.</p>
