        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a commendable commitment to security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and access to sensitive data systems. An acceptable use policy is also in place, indicating foundational security governance. However, a significant gap exists in employee security awareness, as the organization currently does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or on an annual basis for all staff. A recent network scan revealed that port 80 is closed, indicating no direct unencrypted web server exposure via this specific port.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Comprehensive Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks a formal program for security awareness training, neither for new hires during onboarding nor as an annual refresher for all employees. This absence significantly elevates the risk of successful social engineering attacks, phishing incidents, and malware infections, as employees may not possess the necessary knowledge to identify and respond to common cyber threats. This vulnerability was identified through a review of organizational security policies and practices.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All organizational employees</li><li>Sensitive data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li><li>Organizational reputation</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement a comprehensive security awareness training program. This program should include mandatory training for all new employees as part of their onboarding process and annual refresher training for all existing staff. Training content should cover critical topics such as identifying phishing and social engineering attempts, best practices for password management, secure browsing habits, and clear procedures for reporting suspicious activities or potential security incidents. Furthermore, consider conducting periodic simulated phishing exercises to test employee vigilance and reinforce training concepts.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In conclusion, the organization has established a strong baseline for access control through widespread MFA implementation and a clear acceptable use policy. However, the most significant and pervasive vulnerability identified is the complete absence of a structured security awareness training program. This gap leaves the organization susceptible to human-factor risks, which can bypass even robust technical controls. Prioritizing and implementing a continuous security awareness training initiative is crucial to fortifying the organization's defenses against evolving cyber threats and fostering a resilient security culture.</p>
