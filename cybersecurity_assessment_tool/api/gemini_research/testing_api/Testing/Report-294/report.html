        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed minimal open ports, with port 80 identified as closed. This indicates a potentially secure external perimeter regarding common web service vulnerabilities. Internally, the organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and conducts regular security awareness training for all employees, including new hires. However, critical gaps exist in the authentication protocols for computer logins and sensitive data systems, where MFA is not required. Furthermore, the absence of an employee acceptable use policy (AUP) leaves the organization vulnerable to potential misuse of company resources and data.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for employees to log into their computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are compromised, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Login systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk, as compromised credentials could grant direct access to sensitive information, leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and reputational damage. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>Cloud storage</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy (AUP). Without an AUP, employees may not be fully aware of their responsibilities regarding company assets, data, and network usage, leading to potential misuse, security incidents, and legal liabilities. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company assets</li><li>Network resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and access to sensitive data systems. This will significantly enhance security by requiring an additional verification step beyond a password. Furthermore, the organization should develop, disseminate, and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy (AUP) to clearly define expectations for employee conduct regarding company resources and data. While security awareness training is already in place, it should be updated to reinforce the importance of these new policies and MFA protocols.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security through MFA for email and regular security awareness training. However, the absence of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, coupled with the lack of an acceptable use policy, represents significant vulnerabilities that could lead to unauthorized access and data breaches. Addressing these critical gaps is essential to improve the overall security posture and readiness against cyber threats.</p>
