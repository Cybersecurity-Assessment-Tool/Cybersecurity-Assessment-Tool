            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network scan data indicates no immediately apparent open ports, suggesting a basic level of external network hygiene. However, a review of organizational data reveals significant gaps in foundational cybersecurity practices. Specifically, the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across critical access points (email, computer login, sensitive data systems) and a complete lack of security awareness training for employees pose severe internal and external risks. Furthermore, the organization operates without an employee acceptable use policy, which can lead to inconsistent security practices and increased vulnerability to human error.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not utilize Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email, logging into computers, or accessing sensitive data systems. This critical oversight significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access should employee credentials be compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or other means. A single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to critical organizational assets and sensitive information, leading to data breaches, financial loss, and reputational damage. This vulnerability was identified through direct inquiry regarding MFA implementation.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Email systems",
                            "Employee workstations/laptops",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees, nor does it provide annual training for all employees. This leaves the entire workforce vulnerable to social engineering attacks such as phishing, pretexting, and malware. Employees who are not regularly educated on current cyber threats and best practices are more likely to fall victim to these attacks, inadvertently compromising company systems, data, or credentials. This vulnerability was identified through direct inquiry regarding security awareness training programs.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "Email systems",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)",
                        "Overview": "The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. Without a clear AUP, employees may not fully understand their responsibilities and the permissible use of company IT resources, data handling procedures, and internet usage guidelines. This absence can lead to inconsistent security practices, misuse of company assets, data leakage, and increased exposure to cyber threats due to unapproved software installations or risky online behavior. This vulnerability was identified through direct inquiry regarding the existence of an AUP.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "Company IT resources",
                            "Data systems"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. This will significantly enhance protection against credential compromise. Concurrently, a comprehensive security awareness training program should be established, providing initial training for all new hires and mandatory annual refreshers for all employees to educate them on current cyber threats and best practices. Furthermore, the organization must develop and enforce an Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) to clearly define expectations for IT resource usage and data handling, ensuring consistent security behavior across the workforce. Regular reviews of security policies and controls should also be conducted to adapt to evolving threat landscapes.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to a lack of fundamental security controls and employee awareness programs. While external network exposure appears minimal, the absence of MFA, security awareness training, and an acceptable use policy creates substantial internal vulnerabilities that could be exploited through social engineering or credential theft. Addressing these foundational gaps is paramount to improving the organization's overall security posture and readiness against common cyber threats."
