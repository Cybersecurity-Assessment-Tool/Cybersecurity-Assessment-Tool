        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes a MySQL database port (3306) to the network, posing a significant risk. Furthermore, critical gaps exist in identity and access management, as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for email access or computer logins, although it is utilized for sensitive data systems. Policy enforcement is weak, with no employee acceptable use policy in place. Security awareness training is conducted annually for all employees, which is a positive, but new employees do not receive initial security awareness training, leaving them vulnerable during their onboarding period.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network. This exposes the database to potential unauthorized access, brute-force attacks, or exploitation of known MySQL vulnerabilities if not adequately secured, leading to data breaches or service disruption. This was identified via network scanning.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of email account compromise through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks, potentially leading to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, or further internal network penetration. Identified from organizational policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This makes endpoints more vulnerable to unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or guessed, potentially allowing attackers to gain a foothold in the internal network and escalate privileges. Identified from organizational policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network endpoints</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines, employees may engage in activities that introduce security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive data, leading to potential data loss or system compromise. Identified from organizational policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data and systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training upon onboarding. This leaves them susceptible to common social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) and unaware of organizational security protocols, increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents during their initial employment period. Identified from organizational policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational data and systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediate action is required to mitigate the identified risks. For the exposed MySQL port, implement strict firewall rules to restrict access to only necessary internal IP addresses; for long-term security, consider placing the database behind a VPN or using secure tunneling. Implement and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and computer logins to significantly reduce the risk of credential compromise. Develop and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy that clearly outlines responsibilities regarding IT asset usage and data handling. Furthermore, establish mandatory security awareness training as part of the onboarding process for all new employees to ensure they are equipped with essential security knowledge from day one. Continue the existing annual security awareness training for all employees to reinforce best practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization faces several critical cybersecurity vulnerabilities, primarily stemming from an exposed database service and a significant lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for email and computer access. While MFA is correctly applied to sensitive data systems and annual security training is conducted, these positives are overshadowed by the other critical gaps. The absence of an acceptable use policy and initial security training for new hires further exacerbates the overall risk posture. Addressing these vulnerabilities promptly is crucial to enhance the organization's security readiness and protect against potential data breaches and unauthorized access.</p>
