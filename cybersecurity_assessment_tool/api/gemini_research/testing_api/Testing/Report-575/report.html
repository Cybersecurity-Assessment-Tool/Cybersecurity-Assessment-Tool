        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan identified one active host with an open SSH port (22), indicating a potential entry point. While the organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems, a critical gap exists as MFA is not required for computer logins. Furthermore, the absence of an employee acceptable use policy and security awareness training for new employees represents significant foundational weaknesses. Although annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees, the lack of initial training for new hires and a clear acceptable use policy exposes the organization to unnecessary risks from day one. These factors collectively suggest a mixed security posture with notable areas requiring immediate attention.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A critical vulnerability was identified where a service appears to be exposed on localhost. This exposure could potentially be leveraged by an attacker who gains initial access to the system, allowing for privilege escalation or further compromise. The critical severity indicates a high potential for significant impact, including unauthorized access or data exfiltration, if exploited.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly elevates the risk of unauthorized access to endpoints and the internal network. If employee credentials are compromised through phishing, malware, or other means, an attacker can gain direct access to workstations without an additional layer of security, facilitating lateral movement and broader network compromise.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee workstations</li><li>Internal network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> There is no formal acceptable use policy in place for employees. This lack of clear guidelines means employees may not understand the appropriate use of company IT resources, internet, email, and data handling procedures. This can lead to inconsistent security practices, increased risk of data breaches, malware infections, and potential legal liabilities due to misuse or negligence.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Data handling procedures</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees are not provided with security awareness training upon joining the organization. This leaves them unprepared for common social engineering attacks, such as phishing, and unaware of critical security protocols from their first day. Untrained new hires can inadvertently introduce malware, expose sensitive information, or fall victim to scams, posing an immediate and avoidable risk to the organization's security posture.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to mitigate the risk of compromised credentials. A comprehensive employee acceptable use policy should be developed, communicated, and enforced across the organization to establish clear guidelines for IT resource usage. Furthermore, a mandatory security awareness training program must be established for all new employees, ensuring they are equipped with essential security knowledge from day one. The 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability requires immediate investigation to understand its nature and potential impact, followed by appropriate remediation. Additionally, the open SSH port (22) should be reviewed to ensure it is securely configured, patched, and monitored, especially in light of the lack of MFA for computer logins.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing MFA for sensitive systems and conducting annual security awareness training. However, significant vulnerabilities exist, particularly the absence of MFA for computer logins, a critical acceptable use policy, and initial security training for new hires. These gaps, coupled with an identified 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability and an open SSH port, indicate a moderate to high-risk environment. Addressing these core issues is paramount to strengthening the overall security posture and reducing the likelihood of successful cyberattacks and data breaches.</p>
