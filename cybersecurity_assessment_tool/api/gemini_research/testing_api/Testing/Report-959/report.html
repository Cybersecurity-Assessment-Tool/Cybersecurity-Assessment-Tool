        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open SSH port (22), indicating potential remote access capabilities. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for email and sensitive data systems, it is notably absent for computer logins. Furthermore, the organization lacks regular security awareness training for new and existing employees, which could increase susceptibility to social engineering attacks and other human-factor risks. A critical 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability was also identified, requiring immediate attention.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The provided data indicates a critical vulnerability related to 'Localhost Exposed'. While specific details on how it was identified are not available, its critical nature suggests a significant security flaw that could lead to unauthorized access or system compromise.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Authentication for Computers - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised, as a single factor (password) is insufficient to protect against modern attack techniques. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers</li><li>Login systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. This leaves new hires vulnerable to social engineering attacks, phishing, and other common threats, as they may not be aware of best security practices or organizational policies from the start. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Annual Security Awareness Training for All Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. Without regular training, employees may forget best practices, fail to recognize new threats, or become complacent, increasing the overall risk of human-factor security incidents such as phishing, malware infections, or data breaches. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed SSH Service - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH port (22) was identified during the network scan. While SSH is a legitimate service, an exposed port without proper hardening (e.g., strong passwords, key-based authentication, rate limiting, IP restrictions) can be a target for brute-force attacks or other exploitation attempts, potentially leading to unauthorized remote access. This was identified via network scan.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Network perimeter</li><li>Server with port 22 open</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediately investigate the 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability to understand its root cause and implement appropriate remediation, which may include reconfiguring network settings or applying security patches. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins across the organization to significantly enhance protection against credential theft. Establish a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees during their onboarding process and implement annual refresher security awareness training for all employees to keep them informed about evolving threats and best practices. Secure the exposed SSH service by ensuring strong, unique passwords or, preferably, key-based authentication is enforced. Implement IP whitelisting, rate limiting, and regularly patch the SSH server. Consider restricting SSH access to only necessary internal networks or via a jump host.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization faces several significant security challenges, including a critical 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability, an exposed SSH service, and a notable lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for computer logins. Furthermore, the absence of comprehensive and regular security awareness training for all employees, particularly new hires, creates a substantial human-factor risk. While MFA is in place for email and sensitive data systems, the overall readiness is compromised by these unaddressed vulnerabilities, indicating a need for immediate and sustained security improvements to protect against potential breaches and unauthorized access.</p>
