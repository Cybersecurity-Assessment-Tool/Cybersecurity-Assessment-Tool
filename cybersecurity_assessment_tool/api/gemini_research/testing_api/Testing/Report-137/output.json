                "Summary": "The organization's network scan revealed an open Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) port (3389), indicating a potential entry point for attackers. Internally, the organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins, which is a positive security measure. However, MFA is not required for accessing email or sensitive data systems, leaving these critical assets vulnerable to credential-based attacks. Furthermore, the absence of an employee acceptable use policy and a lack of annual security awareness training for all employees suggest gaps in foundational security practices and human factor risk management.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "RDP Exposure",
                        "Overview": "Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed to the internet. This allows potential attackers to attempt brute-force attacks or exploit vulnerabilities in the RDP service to gain unauthorized access to internal systems. The impact could range from unauthorized access to data exfiltration or system compromise. This was identified through a network scan revealing an open port 3389.",

                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Email Access",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. If an attacker gains access to an employee's email, they could launch further internal phishing attacks, access sensitive information, or reset passwords for other services. This was identified through organizational security posture questions.",

                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems",
                        "Overview": "Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk, as compromised credentials (e.g., through phishing or malware) could grant attackers direct access to confidential information, leading to data breaches, regulatory fines, and reputational damage. This was identified through organizational security posture questions.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy",
                        "Overview": "The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This means there are no formal guidelines for employees on the appropriate use of company IT resources, data handling, and internet usage. This can lead to inconsistent security practices, increased risk of insider threats, data leakage, and exposure to malware through unapproved activities. This was identified through organizational security posture questions.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Insufficient Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "While new employees receive security awareness training, there is no annual training for all employees. This results in outdated knowledge regarding evolving threats, new company policies, and best practices. Employees are the first line of defense, and a lack of continuous training increases susceptibility to social engineering attacks, phishing, and other human-factor vulnerabilities. This was identified through organizational security posture questions.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "Organizational security posture"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately close the exposed RDP port (3389) and implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) for secure remote access, ensuring that all RDP connections are tunneled through the VPN with strong authentication. Furthermore, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) should be mandated for all email access and sensitive data systems to significantly reduce the risk of credential compromise. The organization should also develop and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to establish clear guidelines for IT resource usage and data handling. Finally, a program for mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees must be established to ensure continuous education on evolving cyber threats and best security practices.",
            "Conclusion": "In conclusion, the organization faces several critical and high-severity cybersecurity risks, primarily stemming from an exposed RDP service and significant gaps in foundational security controls such as Multi-Factor Authentication for critical systems (email and sensitive data) and a lack of comprehensive security policies and ongoing employee training. While MFA for computer logins is a positive step, the overall readiness is compromised by these unaddressed vulnerabilities, leaving the organization susceptible to unauthorized access, data breaches, and operational disruption. Addressing these issues with the recommended mitigations is crucial for improving the organization's security posture and resilience against cyber threats."
