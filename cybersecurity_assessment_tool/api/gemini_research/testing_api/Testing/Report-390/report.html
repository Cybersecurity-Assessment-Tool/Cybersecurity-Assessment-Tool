        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network was scanned, showing a host as active and port 80 as closed. However, a separate assessment identified an unencrypted web server. The organization currently enforces Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and has an employee acceptable use policy in place. Critical gaps exist in MFA implementation for email and sensitive data systems, as well as in security awareness training for both new and existing employees, indicating a need for significant improvement in foundational security practices.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unencrypted Web Server - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Port 80 is open, indicating that a web server might be running without encryption. This exposes data in transit to potential eavesdropping and interception, compromising data confidentiality. This vulnerability was identified through a security assessment.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts through phishing or brute-force attacks, potentially leading to data breaches, business email compromise, and further network penetration. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not enforced for access to sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are compromised, increasing the risk of data exfiltration, compliance violations, and severe reputational damage. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of New Employee Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. This means new hires may not be aware of common cyber threats, organizational security policies, or best practices, making them more susceptible to social engineering attacks and increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This results in a lack of continuous education on evolving cyber threats and security best practices, leading to a potential degradation of security posture over time as employees forget or become unaware of new risks. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is recommended to immediately implement SSL/TLS encryption for any web services running on port 80, or close the port if the service is not intended to be public. Furthermore, the organization must prioritize the implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and, critically, for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access. A comprehensive security awareness training program should be established, including mandatory training for all new employees upon onboarding and annual refresher training for all existing staff to ensure continuous education on cyber threats and best practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several significant cybersecurity vulnerabilities, primarily stemming from a lack of MFA in critical areas like email and sensitive data systems, and a complete absence of structured security awareness training. While MFA for computer logins and an acceptable use policy are positive steps, the identified gaps expose the organization to high risks of data breaches and unauthorized access. Addressing these foundational security weaknesses is crucial for improving the overall security posture and readiness against evolving cyber threats.</p>
