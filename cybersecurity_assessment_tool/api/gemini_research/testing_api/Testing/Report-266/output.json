            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network currently operates an FTP server (vsftpd 2.3.4) that permits anonymous logins, posing a significant security risk. Internally, while Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required for computer logins, it is notably absent for email and sensitive data systems, leaving critical access points vulnerable. A lack of an employee acceptable use policy and the absence of annual security awareness training for all employees indicate gaps in foundational security practices. Furthermore, a critical vulnerability exists with workstations running the end-of-life Windows 7 operating system, which no longer receives security updates.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Anonymous FTP Access & Outdated Service",
                        "Overview": "The FTP server, running vsftpd version 2.3.4, is configured to allow anonymous login. This configuration can lead to unauthorized access to files, potential data leakage, or even server compromise if write permissions are misconfigured. Additionally, vsftpd 2.3.4 is an outdated version, likely containing known vulnerabilities that could be exploited. This was identified via an Nmap scan on port 21.",

                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Email Access",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks. A compromised email account can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and further internal network penetration.",

                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data highly vulnerable to unauthorized access if a user's primary credentials are compromised. The impact could include severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and significant reputational damage.",

                        "Risk": "Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy",
                        "Overview": "The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines, employees may unknowingly engage in activities that pose security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling company data. This increases the likelihood of security incidents and potential legal liabilities.",

                        "Risk": "Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "While new employees receive security awareness training, there is no annual training for all employees. This results in a stale understanding of current cybersecurity threats, best practices, and organizational policies. Employees are more likely to fall victim to evolving social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, vishing) or make security errors due to a lack of refreshed knowledge.",

                        "Risk": "Outdated Windows Policy (Windows 7)",
                        "Overview": "Several workstations are running Windows 7, an operating system that has reached its end-of-life. This means it no longer receives security updates, patches, or technical support from Microsoft. Systems running Windows 7 are highly vulnerable to known exploits and malware, making them easy targets for attackers and a significant entry point for network compromise.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Workstations running Windows 7"

                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately disable anonymous access on the FTP server and upgrade vsftpd to a current, supported version. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and sensitive data systems to significantly enhance access security. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to establish clear guidelines for IT resource usage. Furthermore, establish a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees to keep them informed about current threats and best practices. Most critically, all workstations running Windows 7 must be upgraded to a currently supported operating system (e.g., Windows 10 or 11) to ensure they receive vital security updates and patches.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization faces several critical and high-severity vulnerabilities, primarily stemming from an outdated operating system (Windows 7), an insecure FTP configuration, and significant gaps in access control (lack of MFA for email and sensitive data). Additionally, the absence of an acceptable use policy and insufficient ongoing security awareness training contribute to a heightened risk profile. While MFA is used for computer logins, the overall readiness is low due to these unaddressed critical vulnerabilities and policy deficiencies, leaving the organization susceptible to data breaches, unauthorized access, and operational disruption."
