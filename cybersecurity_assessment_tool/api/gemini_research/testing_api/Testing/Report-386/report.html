        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, which is a positive security measure. Furthermore, security awareness training is conducted for new employees and annually for all staff, indicating a commitment to user education. However, a critical security gap exists as MFA is not required for access to sensitive data systems. A significant policy deficiency is also noted with the absence of an employee acceptable use policy. Network scans revealed an open FTP service (vsftpd 2.3.4) allowing anonymous login, posing a significant data exposure risk. Additionally, some workstations are identified as running an outdated operating system (Windows 7), which is no longer supported with security updates.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Anonymous FTP Access - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The network scan identified an FTP service (vsftpd 2.3.4) on port 21 that allows anonymous login. This configuration can lead to unauthorized access to files, data leakage, and potential for malicious file uploads, severely compromising data confidentiality and integrity. This vulnerability was identified via an Nmap scan with the 'ftp-anon' script.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>ftp://[host_ip]:21</li><li>vsftpd 2.3.4 service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Operating System - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Several workstations are running Windows 7, an operating system that has reached its end-of-life. This means it no longer receives security updates, making these systems highly vulnerable to known exploits and malware, significantly increasing the risk of system compromise and data breaches. This risk was identified through an internal vulnerability assessment.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if primary credentials are compromised, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication. This vulnerability was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This absence means there are no formal guidelines for employees regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, data handling, and internet usage. This can lead to increased risks of data leakage, malware infections, and non-compliance with regulatory requirements due to unmanaged employee behavior. This vulnerability was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Organizational policy</li><li>Employee conduct</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediate action should be taken to disable anonymous FTP access and configure the FTP service to require strong authentication, or consider decommissioning the FTP service if it is not essential for business operations. Prioritize upgrading all Windows 7 workstations to a currently supported operating system like Windows 10 or 11 to ensure they receive critical security updates and patches. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to add an essential layer of security against credential compromise. Furthermore, develop and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy, ensuring all employees are trained on its contents and acknowledge their understanding. Regular review and update of security policies, along with periodic vulnerability scans, are crucial to identify and address new risks proactively.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security through the implementation of MFA for email and computer logins, alongside regular security awareness training. However, significant vulnerabilities exist, including critical anonymous FTP access, outdated operating systems on workstations, and a lack of MFA for sensitive data systems. The absence of an acceptable use policy also indicates a gap in governance. Addressing these identified risks is crucial to enhance the overall security posture and reduce the likelihood of data breaches and system compromises. The organization's readiness is currently moderate, with key areas requiring immediate attention to mitigate high-impact risks.</p>
