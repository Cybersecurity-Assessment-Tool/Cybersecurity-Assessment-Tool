                "Summary": "The organization's network includes an FTP server running vsftpd 2.3.4, which is configured to allow anonymous access. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is used for email and computer logins, it is notably absent for sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization is running outdated Windows 7 on workstations and lacks comprehensive security awareness training for both new and existing employees, indicating significant gaps in both technical and human-centric security controls.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Outdated Windows Policy",
                        "Overview": "Computers are running Windows 7. This operating system is end-of-life and no longer receives security updates from Microsoft, making systems highly vulnerable to known exploits and increasing the risk of malware infection and data breaches. The lack of vendor support means critical security patches are not available.",

                        "Risk": "Anonymous FTP Access",
                        "Overview": "An FTP server running vsftpd version 2.3.4 is configured to allow anonymous login. This configuration permits unauthorized users to access, potentially upload, or download files without authentication, leading to data exposure, unauthorized data modification, or the introduction of malicious content. The vsftpd 2.3.4 version is also significantly outdated and known to have multiple vulnerabilities.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "FTP Server (port 21)",
                            "vsftpd 2.3.4"

                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if user credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or other means. A single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to sensitive data.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                    {
                        "Risk": "No Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees, nor does it provide annual training for all employees. This leaves the workforce susceptible to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, malware via email) and unaware of best practices for data handling and incident reporting, significantly increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security breaches.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All Employees",
                            "Organizational Security Posture"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately upgrade all workstations running Windows 7 to a currently supported operating system like Windows 10 or 11, or to replace the hardware if upgrades are not feasible. The FTP server should be reconfigured to disable anonymous access and updated to a current, supported version of vsftpd or replaced with a more secure file transfer solution. Implement mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to enhance access control. Furthermore, establish and enforce a comprehensive security awareness training program for all employees, including mandatory training for new hires and annual refreshers for the entire staff, to improve the human firewall against social engineering threats.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces several critical and high-severity vulnerabilities, primarily stemming from outdated software, insecure service configurations, and significant gaps in access control for sensitive data. The absence of a robust security awareness training program further exacerbates these risks by leaving the human element vulnerable. While MFA is in place for email and computer logins, its omission for sensitive data systems is a critical oversight. Addressing these issues promptly is essential to improve the overall security posture and reduce the likelihood of a successful cyberattack."
