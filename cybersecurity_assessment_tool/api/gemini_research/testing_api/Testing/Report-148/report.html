        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The provided network scan data is minimal, indicating no specific network targets were scanned or no open ports were found, which limits the technical network assessment. However, a review of organizational policies reveals significant gaps in fundamental security practices. The organization lacks multi-factor authentication (MFA) across critical access points and has no established security awareness training or acceptable use policies. These deficiencies expose the organization to a high risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and social engineering attacks.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for email access. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. If an attacker gains access to an employee's email, they can potentially access sensitive information, impersonate the employee, or pivot to other systems. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email accounts</li><li>User credentials</li><li>Organizational communication</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for computer logins. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are stolen or guessed. An attacker gaining access to a computer can compromise local data, install malware, or gain network access, leading to potential data exfiltration or system disruption. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network access</li><li>Sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA to access sensitive data systems. This is a critical vulnerability as it means a single compromised credential could grant an attacker direct access to the organization's most valuable assets. The impact could be severe, including data breaches, regulatory fines, reputational damage, and operational disruption. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data repositories</li><li>Critical business applications</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines, employees may engage in activities that inadvertently introduce security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling company data. This increases the likelihood of malware infections, data leakage, and non-compliance. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee devices</li><li>Network resources</li><li>Data integrity</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) due to their unfamiliarity with organizational security protocols and common threats. This significantly increases the risk of initial compromise and can lead to broader security incidents. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Email systems</li><li>Network perimeter</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Annual Security Awareness Training for All Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. Regular training is crucial to keep employees informed about evolving threats, reinforce best practices, and maintain a strong security culture. The absence of such training leaves the workforce susceptible to current attack vectors, increasing the risk of human error leading to security breaches. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Overall security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, as a top priority. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to establish clear guidelines for technology usage. Furthermore, establish a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees upon onboarding and conduct annual refresher training for all staff to ensure continuous education on current threats and best practices. Regularly review and update these policies and training materials to adapt to the evolving threat landscape.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to a lack of fundamental security policies and practices, particularly concerning multi-factor authentication and security awareness training. While the provided network scan data was inconclusive regarding technical network vulnerabilities, the identified policy gaps indicate a low state of readiness against common attack vectors, especially those targeting human factors and credential compromise. Addressing these foundational weaknesses is paramount to improving the overall security posture and reducing the likelihood of a successful cyberattack.</p>
