        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes an Nginx web server (version 1.18.0) on port 443, indicating an active web presence. While the organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and conducts security awareness training for new employees, significant gaps exist in its overall security posture. Notably, MFA is not required for accessing email or sensitive data systems, and there is a complete absence of an employee acceptable use policy. Furthermore, annual security awareness training for all employees is not conducted, leaving the organization vulnerable to evolving threats and human error.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks. A compromised email account can lead to business email compromise (BEC) scams, data exfiltration, and further lateral movement within the network. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>User email accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not enforced for accessing systems containing sensitive data. This exposes critical organizational data to a higher risk of unauthorized access. If an attacker obtains credentials for these systems, they can access, modify, or exfiltrate sensitive information without an additional layer of security. This could lead to severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and significant reputational damage. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>File shares containing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Web Server Software (Nginx) - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nginx web server running on port 443 is version 1.18.0. This version is significantly outdated and has reached its End-of-Life (EOL) in April 2023. Running outdated software means it no longer receives security updates, leaving it vulnerable to numerous publicly known exploits and vulnerabilities that have been discovered since its release. Attackers can leverage these known flaws to gain unauthorized access, perform denial-of-service attacks, or execute arbitrary code on the server. This vulnerability was identified via network scanning.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Web server (nginx 1.18.0)</li><li>Port 443 (HTTPS)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy (AUP). Without a formal AUP, employees may be unaware of the proper and secure use of company IT resources, data, and internet access. This can lead to risky behaviors such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, sharing sensitive information inappropriately, or using company assets for personal, non-work-related activities, increasing the overall attack surface and potential for security incidents. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational IT systems and data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. Security threats and best practices evolve rapidly. Without regular, updated training, employees may forget previous lessons, become complacent, or remain unaware of new and emerging threats like sophisticated phishing techniques or social engineering tactics. This significantly increases the likelihood of successful attacks originating from human error or manipulation. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational systems and data</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, immediate action is recommended across several key areas. Firstly, implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access, even if credentials are compromised. Secondly, the Nginx web server (version 1.18.0) must be updated to the latest stable and supported version to patch known vulnerabilities and ensure ongoing security updates. Thirdly, develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy (AUP) to clearly define expectations for secure IT resource usage and mitigate risks associated with employee misconduct. Finally, establish a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees to keep them informed about evolving threats and reinforce secure behaviors, thereby reducing the risk of human-factor incidents.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing MFA for computer logins and providing initial security awareness training. However, critical vulnerabilities persist, particularly concerning the lack of MFA for email and sensitive data systems, the use of outdated web server software, and significant gaps in policy and ongoing employee education. These weaknesses collectively expose the organization to a high risk of data breaches, unauthorized access, and operational disruption. Addressing these identified risks promptly is crucial for improving the overall security readiness and protecting valuable assets.</p>
