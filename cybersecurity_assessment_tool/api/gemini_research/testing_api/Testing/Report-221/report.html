        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and computer logins, which are strong security practices. However, MFA is not required for accessing sensitive data systems, posing a significant risk. An acceptable use policy is in place, and annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees. Notably, new employees do not receive security awareness training, which could lead to early security missteps. A network scan identified an open Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) port (3389), indicating potential external exposure.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>RDP Exposure - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed externally, allowing potential attackers to attempt brute-force attacks or exploit RDP vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to internal systems. This was identified via a network scan showing port 3389 open.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>External IP address with port 3389 open</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if credentials are compromised, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive dedicated security awareness training upon onboarding. This leaves them vulnerable to common social engineering attacks, phishing, and other security threats, potentially introducing vulnerabilities into the organization's security posture from day one. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately close the externally exposed RDP port (3389) and implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) for secure remote access, ensuring all RDP connections are tunneled through the VPN. Furthermore, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be mandated for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access even if primary credentials are compromised. The organization should also establish a comprehensive security awareness training program for all new employees as part of their onboarding process to instill good security practices from the outset. Regular security audits and policy reviews are also advised to maintain a robust security posture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security through MFA for email and computer logins, and annual security training. However, critical gaps exist, particularly the external exposure of RDP, the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems, and the lack of security awareness training for new hires. Addressing these vulnerabilities promptly is crucial to significantly enhance the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and protect against potential breaches.</p>
