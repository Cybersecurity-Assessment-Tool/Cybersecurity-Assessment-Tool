            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network scan data indicates that port 80 is closed. However, a specific vulnerability assessment identified an unencrypted web server with port 80 open. The organization has an acceptable use policy and provides security awareness training for new employees, but lacks annual training for all employees. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is used for computer logins but not for email or sensitive data systems.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Unencrypted Web Server",
                        "Overview": "Port 80 is open, indicating an unencrypted web server. This exposes web traffic to potential eavesdropping and data interception, impacting data confidentiality. This vulnerability was identified through a security assessment.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Port 80"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "Immediate action should be taken to address the unencrypted web server by closing port 80 if it is not intended for use. For long-term security, if a web server is required, it must be configured to use SSL/TLS encryption to protect data in transit. Additionally, the organization should implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems to enhance access control. Regular, at least annual, security awareness training for all employees is crucial to maintain a strong security posture and educate staff on evolving threats.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization exhibits a mixed security posture. While some foundational elements like an acceptable use policy and new employee training are in place, critical gaps exist, particularly concerning MFA implementation for email and sensitive data, and the lack of annual security awareness training. The identified unencrypted web server on port 80 represents a significant vulnerability that could lead to data exposure. Addressing these issues is paramount to improving the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness."
