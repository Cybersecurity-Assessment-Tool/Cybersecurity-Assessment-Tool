        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization currently implements Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems, which is a positive security measure. However, a significant gap exists as MFA is not required for computer logins, leaving endpoints vulnerable to credential-based attacks. Furthermore, the organization lacks fundamental security policies, specifically an employee acceptable use policy, and does not conduct any form of security awareness training for new or existing employees. This indicates a low level of security readiness concerning human factors and policy enforcement.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for computer logins significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to company workstations and internal networks. If an employee's login credentials (username and password) are compromised through phishing, malware, or other means, an attacker could gain direct access to their computer without an additional layer of verification. This could lead to data theft, system compromise, or further lateral movement within the network. This vulnerability was identified through the organization's self-reported security posture.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers/endpoints</li><li>Internal network access</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not have an employee acceptable use policy in place. This lack of a formal policy means employees may not be clearly informed about the appropriate use of company assets, data handling procedures, internet usage guidelines, and prohibited activities. This can lead to inconsistent security practices, increased risk of data leakage, misuse of company resources, and potential legal liabilities. Without clear guidelines, employees might inadvertently engage in risky behaviors. This vulnerability was identified through the organization's self-reported security posture.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company data</li><li>Network resources</li><li>Company assets</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or annually for all employees. This critical gap leaves the workforce susceptible to various social engineering attacks, such as phishing, pretexting, and baiting. Untrained employees are more likely to fall victim to these attacks, which can lead to credential compromise, malware infections, and data breaches. Human error remains a leading cause of security incidents, and without regular training, employees cannot effectively act as a strong line of defense. This vulnerability was identified through the organization's self-reported security posture.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li><li>Email systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication for all computer logins to protect endpoints from unauthorized access. Concurrently, a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy must be developed and formally communicated to all staff, outlining expectations for secure behavior and resource utilization. Most critically, a mandatory security awareness training program should be established, including initial training for all new hires and annual refresher courses for all employees, to educate them on identifying and reporting security threats like phishing and social engineering attempts. These measures will significantly enhance the organization's overall security posture by addressing critical human and policy-related vulnerabilities.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing MFA for sensitive systems. However, significant vulnerabilities exist due to the absence of MFA for computer logins, a lack of an acceptable use policy, and, most critically, the complete absence of security awareness training for its workforce. These gaps indicate a low level of readiness against common cyber threats that exploit human factors and policy weaknesses. Addressing these areas is paramount to improving the organization's resilience against cyberattacks.</p>
