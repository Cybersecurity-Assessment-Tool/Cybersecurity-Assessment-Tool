        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, and by conducting regular security awareness training for all employees. However, critical vulnerabilities were identified, specifically the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems and the lack of an employee acceptable use policy. A network scan identified an open port 8080, which was subsequently confirmed to be a false positive and secured, indicating no immediate network-level exploitation risk from this specific port.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information should primary credentials (e.g., passwords) be compromised through phishing, malware, or other attack vectors. Without MFA, a single compromised credential can grant an attacker full access to sensitive data, leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and reputational damage. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'Do you require MFA to access sensitive data systems?': 'No'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). Without an AUP, there are no clear guidelines or expectations for employees regarding the proper use of company IT resources, data handling, internet usage, and security best practices. This absence can lead to inconsistent employee behavior, increased risk of data leakage, introduction of malware, and potential legal or compliance issues due to misuse of company assets or data. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'Does your organization have an employee acceptable use policy?': 'No'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Data handling processes</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all access to sensitive data systems. This critical step will add a robust layer of security, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access even if user credentials are compromised. Concurrently, the organization must develop and implement a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). This policy should clearly define expectations for employee conduct regarding IT resource usage, data handling, and security protocols. All employees should receive mandatory training on the AUP, and their acknowledgment of understanding and compliance should be formally documented. Regular reviews and updates to the AUP are also essential to ensure its continued relevance and effectiveness.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has established some foundational security practices, such as MFA for email and computer logins, and consistent security awareness training, significant vulnerabilities persist. The lack of MFA for sensitive data systems presents a high risk of unauthorized data access, and the absence of an Employee Acceptable Use Policy exposes the organization to potential misuse of resources and compliance challenges. Addressing these critical gaps is paramount to enhancing the overall security posture, strengthening readiness against evolving cyber threats, and protecting sensitive organizational assets.</p>
