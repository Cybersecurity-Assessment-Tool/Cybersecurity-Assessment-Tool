        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan indicates at least one active host, with port 80 (HTTP) reported as closed. This suggests that direct unencrypted web access is not currently exposed via this port. From an organizational policy standpoint, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required for email access, which is a positive security measure. However, significant gaps exist as MFA is not mandated for computer logins or access to sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not provide security awareness training for new employees, although annual training is conducted for all existing staff.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unencrypted Web Server - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A previous assessment indicated that Port 80 is open, allowing unencrypted HTTP traffic. This could lead to sensitive data exposure if transmitted over this channel, as data in transit would be vulnerable to interception. This was identified through a previous vulnerability assessment.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are compromised, as a single factor (password) is insufficient to protect against modern attack vectors like phishing or brute-force attacks. This was identified via organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers</li><li>User authentication process</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if user credentials are stolen or guessed, potentially leading to severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and significant reputational damage. This was identified via organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Access control mechanisms</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines, employees may engage in activities that introduce security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling company data, leading to increased exposure to cyber threats and potential legal liabilities. This was identified via organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee behavior</li><li>Organizational security posture</li><li>Data handling practices</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training during their onboarding process. This means new hires may not be aware of common cyber threats, organizational security policies, or best practices from day one, making them more susceptible to phishing, social engineering, and other attacks, thereby increasing the organization's overall risk. This was identified via organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Onboarding process</li><li>Overall human element security</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is recommended to immediately review the status of Port 80 to confirm it remains closed or implement SSL/TLS encryption if web services are intended to be public-facing. Crucially, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be implemented and enforced for all computer logins and access to sensitive data systems to significantly enhance protection against credential compromise. The organization should develop and formally implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy, clearly outlining expected behavior and prohibited activities. Furthermore, mandatory security awareness training should be integrated into the onboarding process for all new employees, complementing the existing annual training program to ensure a consistent baseline understanding of cybersecurity best practices across the entire workforce.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing MFA for email and conducting annual security awareness training. However, significant vulnerabilities persist, particularly concerning the lack of MFA for computer and sensitive data system access, the absence of an acceptable use policy, and the omission of security awareness training for new hires. Addressing these critical gaps is paramount to strengthening the organization's overall security posture and reducing its susceptibility to common cyber threats.</p>
