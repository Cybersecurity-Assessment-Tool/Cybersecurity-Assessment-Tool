        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization operates a network that includes a MySQL database running version 5.7.33 with port 3306 openly accessible. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required for computer logins, it is not enforced for email access or sensitive data systems. The organization has an acceptable use policy in place and conducts security awareness training for new employees, but it lacks a program for annual security awareness training for all employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network, potentially exposing the database to unauthorized access. This was identified via network scanning, showing MySQL version 5.7.33 running on this open port. An attacker could exploit this open port to attempt to gain access to the database, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing or credential stuffing attacks, as a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to sensitive communications and potentially serve as a pivot point to other systems. This policy gap was identified through organizational data review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if a user's password is compromised, bypassing a crucial layer of security that could otherwise prevent a breach. This policy gap was identified through organizational data review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, there is no annual training for all employees. This leads to a degradation of security knowledge over time, making employees more susceptible to evolving threats such as advanced phishing techniques, social engineering, and malware. This gap in ongoing education was identified through organizational data review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, limiting it only to necessary internal IP addresses or requiring a VPN for any external access. Furthermore, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) should be promptly implemented and enforced for all email accounts and sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access even if passwords are compromised. The organization must also establish and enforce a policy for mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees to ensure continuous education on current threats and best practices. Regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing should be conducted to identify and address new exposures proactively.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several significant security vulnerabilities, including an exposed MySQL database and critical gaps in MFA implementation for email and sensitive data systems. While some foundational security practices are in place, the absence of annual security awareness training further weakens the overall security posture. Addressing these high-priority risks is crucial to enhance the organization's readiness against cyber threats and protect its sensitive assets from potential breaches.</p>
