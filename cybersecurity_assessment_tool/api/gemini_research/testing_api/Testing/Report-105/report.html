        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan identified an open port 8080, which was later confirmed as a false positive and secured. However, a review of organizational data revealed significant gaps in security posture related to authentication and employee training. Specifically, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for email access, computer logins, or sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization lacks both initial security awareness training for new employees and annual refresher training for all employees. An acceptable use policy is in place, which is a positive foundation.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Without MFA, email accounts are highly susceptible to credential stuffing, phishing, and brute-force attacks. A compromised email can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and further network penetration. This vulnerability was identified by reviewing the organization's security policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Not requiring MFA for computer logins significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or guessed. This can lead to direct access to internal systems, data, and potential lateral movement within the network. This vulnerability was identified by reviewing the organization's security policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee workstations</li><li>Network endpoints</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Critical sensitive data systems are exposed to a higher risk of unauthorized access without MFA. If an attacker gains access to credentials, they can directly access and potentially exfiltrate or tamper with sensitive organizational data, leading to severe compliance and reputational damage. This vulnerability was identified by reviewing the organization's security policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>Critical applications</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees, without initial security awareness training, are more likely to fall victim to social engineering attacks (phishing, pretexting) or unknowingly introduce vulnerabilities through poor security practices. This increases the overall human risk factor for the organization. This vulnerability was identified by reviewing the organization's HR and security training policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Annual Security Awareness Training for All Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Without regular, annual security awareness training, employees may forget best practices, become complacent, or not be updated on new and evolving threats. This leads to a degradation of the human firewall over time, making the organization more vulnerable to various cyberattacks. This vulnerability was identified by reviewing the organization's HR and security training policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, including email systems, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. This will add a crucial layer of defense against credential-based attacks. Furthermore, a comprehensive security awareness training program should be established. This program must include mandatory training for all new employees upon onboarding and annual refresher training for all existing employees to ensure they are aware of current threats and best security practices. The existing acceptable use policy should be regularly reviewed and reinforced through these training initiatives.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant vulnerabilities primarily due to the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for key access points and a lack of a structured security awareness training program for its employees. While an acceptable use policy is in place, its effectiveness is diminished without consistent reinforcement and employee education. Addressing these critical gaps in authentication and human-factor security is paramount to improving the organization's overall readiness against cyber threats and protecting its sensitive assets.</p>
