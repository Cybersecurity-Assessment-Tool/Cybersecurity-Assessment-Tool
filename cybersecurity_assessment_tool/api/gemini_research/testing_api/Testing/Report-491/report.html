        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan identified an open SSH port (22) on a host, indicating a potential attack surface. While some critical security measures are in place, such as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and sensitive data systems, significant gaps exist in other areas. Specifically, email access lacks MFA, there is no formal acceptable use policy for employees, and annual security awareness training for all employees is not conducted, despite new employees receiving initial training. A critical vulnerability related to a 'Localhost Exposed' service was also identified, posing a severe risk to internal resources.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed Service - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A critical service or configuration is exposed, potentially allowing unauthorized access to internal resources or sensitive data. This vulnerability was identified with a CVSS score of 10.0, indicating its severe impact and ease of exploitation if not properly addressed.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li><li>Critical Service Configuration</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks, as a single compromised password can grant full access to an employee's email and potentially lead to further internal network access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email System</li><li>Employee Accounts</li><li>Authentication Policies</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port (Port 22) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Port 22, commonly used for Secure Shell (SSH) access, is open on a host. While SSH is a secure protocol, an open port represents an attack surface. Without proper hardening (e.g., strong passwords, key-based authentication, rate limiting, disabling root login, up-to-date software), it can be vulnerable to brute-force attacks, credential compromise, or exploitation of SSH daemon vulnerabilities.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host IP</li><li>SSH Service</li><li>Network Perimeter</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy (AUP). Without clear guidelines on appropriate use of company IT resources, employees may inadvertently engage in risky behaviors, leading to security incidents, data breaches, or compliance violations due to a lack of understanding of expected conduct.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Organizational Policy</li><li>Employee Behavior</li><li>IT Resource Usage</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive initial security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual training for all employees. This leads to a degradation of security knowledge over time, making employees more susceptible to evolving threats like phishing, social engineering, and malware, as their understanding of current threats diminishes.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee Awareness</li><li>Organizational Training Program</li><li>Human Factor Security</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is crucial to immediately investigate and reconfigure the 'Localhost Exposed' service to ensure it is not externally accessible or is properly secured with robust authentication and access controls. Implement mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access to significantly reduce the risk of account compromise. For the open SSH port, conduct a thorough review of SSH configurations, implement key-based authentication, disable password authentication where possible, restrict access via firewall rules to only necessary source IPs, and ensure the SSH daemon is regularly updated. Develop and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy (AUP) that clearly outlines expectations for IT resource usage and conduct. Finally, establish a recurring annual security awareness training program for all employees to ensure their knowledge of current threats and best practices remains up-to-date.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a mixed security posture. While strong controls like MFA for sensitive systems are commendable, the presence of a critical 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability, the lack of MFA for email, and significant gaps in policy and ongoing employee training indicate a substantial risk exposure. Addressing these vulnerabilities, particularly the critical exposure and the human element risks, is paramount to enhancing the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and resilience against potential threats.</p>
