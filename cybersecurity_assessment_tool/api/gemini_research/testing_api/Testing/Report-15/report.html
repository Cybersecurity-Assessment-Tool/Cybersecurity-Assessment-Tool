        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently hosts a MySQL database, version 5.7.33, with port 3306 openly accessible. In terms of organizational security practices, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is mandated for email and sensitive data systems, which is a positive control. However, MFA is not required for computer logins, representing a potential vulnerability for endpoint access. An acceptable use policy is established, and new employees receive initial security awareness training. A notable gap is the absence of annual security awareness training for all employees, which could lead to a degradation of security posture over time.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network. This exposes the database to potential unauthorized access, data breaches, and denial-of-service attacks if not properly secured. The vulnerability was identified through an Nmap scan which showed port 3306 as open and the service identified as MySQL version 5.7.33.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted IP addresses or internal networks. For a more robust, long-term solution, consider placing the database behind a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or utilizing secure tunneling to encrypt and authenticate all database traffic. Furthermore, the organization should implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to enhance endpoint security. Finally, it is crucial to establish and enforce a policy for mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees to ensure continuous education on current threats and best practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization exhibits a mixed security posture. While strong controls like MFA for email and sensitive data, and an acceptable use policy are in place, critical vulnerabilities exist. The open MySQL port 3306 poses a significant risk of data exposure. Additionally, the lack of MFA for computer logins and the absence of annual security awareness training for all employees represent notable gaps in the overall security framework. Addressing these areas is paramount to improving the organization's readiness against cyber threats and protecting its assets.</p>
