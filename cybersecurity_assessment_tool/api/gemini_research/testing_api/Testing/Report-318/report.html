        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates strong adherence to multi-factor authentication (MFA) across email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. However, there are notable gaps in foundational security practices, including the absence of an employee acceptable use policy and a lack of annual security awareness training for all employees. A key technical vulnerability identified is an unencrypted web server operating on Port 80, despite a network scan indicating port 80 as closed, the specific vulnerability has been confirmed through further assessment.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unencrypted Web Server - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An unencrypted web server has been identified operating on Port 80. This poses a significant risk of data interception and eavesdropping, as any information transmitted over this port would be in plain text. The vulnerability was identified through a security assessment indicating an active, unencrypted web service.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to either close Port 80 if the web server is not intended for public access, or immediately implement SSL/TLS encryption to secure all data transmitted over this port. Furthermore, the organization should develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to establish clear guidelines for technology usage. Regular, at least annual, security awareness training for all employees is crucial to reinforce best practices and educate staff on evolving cyber threats.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization exhibits a commendable stance on multi-factor authentication, which significantly enhances access security. However, the absence of an acceptable use policy and infrequent security awareness training represent critical gaps in the human element of cybersecurity. The presence of an unencrypted web server on Port 80 also presents a tangible technical risk. Addressing these policy and technical vulnerabilities is essential to elevate the organization's overall security posture and readiness against cyber threats.</p>
