        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network posture, based on the provided data, indicates no specific technical vulnerabilities were identified through network scans. However, a review of organizational policies reveals critical gaps in multi-factor authentication (MFA) implementation, particularly for email access and sensitive data systems. While the organization has strong policies in place for acceptable use and regular security awareness training, the absence of MFA in key areas presents significant attack vectors that could lead to unauthorized access and data breaches.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Email Account Protection - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee inboxes if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. Compromised email accounts can lead to further internal system breaches, data exfiltration, and business email compromise (BEC) scams. This was identified through the organizational policy questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email accounts</li><li>Email servers</li><li>User credentials</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Sensitive Data System Protection - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if a user's primary credentials are stolen or guessed. A breach of these systems could lead to significant data loss, regulatory non-compliance, reputational damage, and severe financial penalties. This was identified through the organizational policy questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>Critical applications</li><li>User credentials</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts. This should include all users and be enforced at the login stage. Furthermore, MFA must be mandated for access to all systems containing sensitive data. This will add a crucial layer of security, making it significantly harder for attackers to gain unauthorized access even if they obtain user credentials. Regular audits of MFA enforcement and user compliance should also be conducted.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently exhibits a mixed security readiness. While it demonstrates good practices in security awareness training and acceptable use policies, the critical absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for email and sensitive data systems represents a significant vulnerability. Addressing these MFA gaps is paramount to enhancing the organization's overall security posture and protecting against common and impactful cyber threats. Without these fundamental controls, the organization remains at a high risk of credential-based attacks and subsequent data breaches.</p>
