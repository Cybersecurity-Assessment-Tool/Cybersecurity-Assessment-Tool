                "Summary": "The organization operates a network that includes an FTP server running vsftpd version 2.3.4, which is configured to allow anonymous logins. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for computer logins and sensitive data systems, it is not required for email access. Furthermore, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees, although new employees do receive initial training.",

                        "Risk": "Anonymous FTP Access",
                        "Overview": "The FTP server (vsftpd 2.3.4) on port 21 allows anonymous login. This configuration can lead to unauthorized access to files, data leakage, or even server compromise if write permissions are misconfigured. It was identified via an Nmap scan with the 'ftp-anon' script.",

                        "Risk": "Outdated Windows Policy",
                        "Overview": "Computers are running Windows 7, an operating system that has reached its end-of-life and no longer receives security updates from Microsoft. This exposes workstations to known and unpatched vulnerabilities, making them susceptible to various cyberattacks, including malware, ransomware, and exploits. This was identified through existing vulnerability reports.",

                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Email",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing, as a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to an employee's email. This was identified from the organizational data.",

                        "Risk": "No Employee Acceptable Use Policy",
                        "Overview": "The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines, employees may engage in activities that inadvertently introduce security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive data. This increases the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents. This was identified from the organizational data.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "No Annual Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "While new employees receive security awareness training, there is no annual training for all employees. This means employees may not be updated on the latest threats, best practices, or changes in organizational security policies, leading to a degradation of security posture over time and increased susceptibility to social engineering attacks. This was identified from the organizational data.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Organizational Policy",

                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "Immediately disable anonymous FTP access on the vsftpd server. If FTP functionality is essential, implement secure alternatives like SFTP or FTPS with strong authentication and access controls. Prioritize upgrading all workstations running Windows 7 to a currently supported operating system (e.g., Windows 10 or 11) to ensure ongoing security updates and support. Implement and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts to significantly enhance protection against credential theft. Develop and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy that clearly outlines expectations for secure behavior, data handling, and system usage, ensuring all employees acknowledge and understand it. Establish a program for mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees, covering current threat landscapes, phishing recognition, data handling best practices, and policy updates. Additionally, conduct regular vulnerability scans and penetration tests to proactively identify and address new risks.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization faces significant risks from an anonymously accessible FTP server, outdated Windows 7 workstations, and a lack of MFA for email. Furthermore, gaps in security policies, specifically the absence of an acceptable use policy and annual security awareness training, contribute to a heightened human risk factor. While MFA is in place for computer logins and sensitive data systems, the identified vulnerabilities and policy gaps indicate a moderate to low level of overall cybersecurity readiness. Immediate action is required to address critical technical vulnerabilities and strengthen foundational security policies and training programs to mitigate potential breaches and data loss."
