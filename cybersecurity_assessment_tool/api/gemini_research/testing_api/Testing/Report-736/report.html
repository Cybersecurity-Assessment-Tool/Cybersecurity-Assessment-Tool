        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Based on the provided network scan data, no open ports or active services were identified, suggesting a potentially locked-down external perimeter or a limited scan scope. However, an assessment of the organizational data reveals critical security gaps related to identity and access management. While the organization has commendable practices in place for security awareness training for all employees and maintains an acceptable use policy, and MFA is utilized for sensitive data systems, the absence of MFA for email access and computer logins presents significant vulnerabilities.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly elevates the risk of unauthorized access to employee inboxes if credentials are stolen or compromised through phishing attacks, credential stuffing, or brute-force attempts. Email often serves as a primary vector for initial compromise and contains sensitive information, making its compromise a high-impact event. This vulnerability was identified directly from the organizational policy data indicating 'No' for MFA on email access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee email accounts</li><li>Email servers/services</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if user credentials are stolen or guessed. Without a second factor, a compromised password grants full access to the workstation and potentially internal network resources, which can lead to data breaches, malware infections, or lateral movement by attackers within the network. This vulnerability was identified directly from the organizational policy data indicating 'No' for MFA on computer logins.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee workstations/computers</li><li>Active Directory/identity providers</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To substantially bolster the organization's security posture, it is imperative to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points. Specifically, MFA must be mandated for all email access to protect against credential stuffing, phishing, and other credential-based attacks. Furthermore, MFA should be enforced for all computer logins to secure endpoints and prevent unauthorized access to internal systems, even if primary credentials are compromised. While the organization has strong foundations in security awareness training and acceptable use policies, and already uses MFA for sensitive data systems, extending MFA to email and computer logins will close critical gaps in identity and access management, providing a robust layer of defense against common attack vectors. Regular reviews of MFA implementation and ongoing user training on its importance and usage should also be conducted.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently presents a mixed state of cybersecurity readiness. While positive steps have been taken in security awareness training and acceptable use policies, and MFA is applied to sensitive data systems, critical vulnerabilities exist due to the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for email access and computer logins. These gaps represent high-severity risks that could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and significant operational disruption. Addressing these MFA deficiencies is paramount to improving the overall security posture and reducing the attack surface against common cyber threats, thereby enhancing the organization's resilience against modern cyberattacks.</p>
