        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The network scan revealed an active host with an open port 80, indicating a web service potentially running over unencrypted HTTP. Organizational data indicates several critical gaps in security posture, particularly concerning Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and employee security awareness training. While MFA is required for computer logins, it is notably absent for email and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization lacks both initial security awareness training for new employees and annual refresher training for all staff, which are fundamental components of a robust human firewall.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee inboxes if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. Email often contains sensitive information and can be a gateway to other systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing systems containing sensitive data. This poses a critical risk, as compromised credentials could lead to direct access to confidential information, potentially resulting in data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and severe reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts with access to sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate New Employee Security Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. This leaves new hires vulnerable to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) and unaware of organizational security policies and best practices, increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not provide annual security awareness training for all employees. Regular training is crucial to keep employees updated on evolving threats, reinforce security best practices, and maintain a strong security culture. Without it, employees may become complacent or unaware of new attack vectors.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unencrypted Web Traffic (Port 80 Open) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A network scan identified an open port 80 (HTTP) on a host. While HTTP is a standard protocol for web traffic, it transmits data in plain text, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. If sensitive information is exchanged over HTTP, it could be intercepted. This also indicates a potential lack of forced HTTPS redirection.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with open port 80</li><li>Web services running on port 80</li><li>User data transmitted over HTTP</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and, critically, for all sensitive data systems. This will provide a crucial layer of defense against credential compromise. Additionally, a comprehensive security awareness training program should be established, including mandatory training for all new employees upon onboarding and annual refresher training for all staff. This will empower employees to recognize and report threats, reducing the risk of human error. For the identified open port 80, it is advised to ensure all web traffic is encrypted using HTTPS and that HTTP requests are automatically redirected to HTTPS. If port 80 is not actively used, it should be closed or restricted. Regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing should also be conducted to identify and address further potential weaknesses.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for critical systems like email and sensitive data, and a complete lack of a structured security awareness training program for its employees. The presence of an open, unencrypted web port further compounds these risks. While an acceptable use policy is in place, the foundational technical and human controls are insufficient, leaving the organization vulnerable to various cyber threats, including data breaches and unauthorized access. Addressing these vulnerabilities is paramount to improving the overall security readiness and protecting organizational assets.</p>
