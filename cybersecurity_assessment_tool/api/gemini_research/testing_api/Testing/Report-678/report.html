        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a mixed security posture. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required for email access and an acceptable use policy is in place, significant gaps exist in MFA implementation for computer logins and sensitive data systems. Security awareness training is conducted annually for all employees, but new employees do not receive dedicated training. A network scan indicated port 80 is closed, however, a vulnerability assessment identified a potential unencrypted web server on port 80.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unencrypted Web Server - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Port 80 is identified as potentially open and unencrypted. This poses a risk of data interception and exposure if sensitive information is transmitted over this channel without encryption. The impact could lead to unauthorized disclosure of confidential data. This vulnerability was identified through a security assessment.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is recommended to immediately address the unencrypted web server vulnerability by either closing port 80 if not needed, or implementing SSL/TLS encryption for all web traffic. Furthermore, the organization should implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and access to sensitive data systems to significantly enhance access control. A dedicated security awareness training program for new employees should be established to ensure foundational security knowledge from day one. Regular reviews of security policies and configurations are also advised.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several key vulnerabilities, primarily stemming from incomplete MFA implementation and a potential unencrypted web server. While some foundational security practices are in place, such as annual security awareness training and an acceptable use policy, the lack of MFA for critical systems and new employee training represents significant readiness gaps. Addressing these areas will substantially improve the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and reduce the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.</p>
