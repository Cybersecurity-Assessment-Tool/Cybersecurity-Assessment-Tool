        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to multi-factor authentication (MFA), requiring it for email access, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. This significantly enhances protection against unauthorized access via compromised credentials. However, the network scan identified an open SSH port (22), which, if not properly secured, could serve as an entry point for attackers. A critical gap exists in the organization's security posture regarding human factors: there is no employee acceptable use policy, nor is there security awareness training for new employees or annual refresher training for all staff. These omissions create substantial vulnerabilities that could be exploited through social engineering or unintentional employee actions.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The absence of an employee acceptable use policy means there are no formal guidelines dictating appropriate behavior regarding company IT resources. This lack of policy can lead to employees engaging in risky activities, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive data, increasing the likelihood of malware infections, data breaches, or compliance violations. This vulnerability was identified through organizational data indicating no such policy is in place.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network resources</li><li>IT systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees are often prime targets for social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) due to their unfamiliarity with organizational security protocols and common threats. Without initial security awareness training, new hires are more susceptible to falling victim to these attacks, which can lead to credential compromise, malware deployment, or unauthorized data access. This vulnerability was identified through organizational data indicating no training for new employees.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Email systems</li><li>Internal applications</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Cyber threats are constantly evolving, and without regular (at least annual) security awareness training, employees' knowledge of current threats and best practices can become outdated. This increases the overall susceptibility of the organization to evolving social engineering tactics, ransomware, and other advanced persistent threats, potentially leading to widespread security incidents. This vulnerability was identified through organizational data indicating no annual training for all employees.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li><li>Endpoint devices</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed SSH Service - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH port (22) was detected on a host during the network scan. While SSH is a secure protocol, an exposed service presents a potential attack vector if not adequately secured. Attackers could attempt brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or exploit known vulnerabilities in the SSH daemon to gain unauthorized access to the system. This could lead to full system compromise, data exfiltration, or further lateral movement within the network. The risk's severity depends heavily on the strength of authentication (e.g., password vs. key-based, MFA) and access restrictions in place.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with open port 22</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately develop and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy, clearly outlining expectations for IT resource usage. Concurrently, mandatory security awareness training programs should be established for all new employees upon onboarding and conducted annually for all existing staff to ensure up-to-date knowledge of cyber threats and best practices. For the exposed SSH service, implement robust security measures such as restricting access to trusted IP addresses, enforcing key-based authentication, disabling password authentication, and ensuring the SSH daemon is regularly patched and configured securely. Consider implementing MFA for SSH access if feasible.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has a commendable stance on multi-factor authentication, critical vulnerabilities exist due to a lack of foundational security policies and employee training. The absence of an acceptable use policy and comprehensive security awareness programs for both new and existing employees significantly elevates the risk of human-factor related security incidents. Additionally, the presence of an open SSH port requires immediate attention to prevent unauthorized access. Addressing these gaps is paramount to improving the organization's overall security posture and readiness against evolving cyber threats.</p>
