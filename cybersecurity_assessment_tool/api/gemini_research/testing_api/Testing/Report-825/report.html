        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The network scan identified an open port 8080 exposing a service titled 'TOP SECRET DB'. This is a critical finding that indicates a severe security vulnerability. Furthermore, an assessment of organizational data revealed significant weaknesses in foundational security practices, including the absence of multi-factor authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, a lack of an employee acceptable use policy, and no dedicated security awareness training for new employees. While annual security awareness training is conducted, these identified gaps collectively present a high-risk security posture for the organization.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed 'TOP SECRET DB' on Port 8080 - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open port 8080 was identified during the network scan, exposing a service with the title 'TOP SECRET DB'. This direct exposure of what appears to be a critical database without apparent authentication or robust access controls is a severe security flaw. An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to, exfiltrate, or manipulate highly sensitive information, leading to catastrophic data breaches, significant regulatory fines, and severe reputational damage. This vulnerability was identified via an Nmap scan that showed port 8080 as open and the `http-title` script outputting 'TOP SECRET DB'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li><li>'TOP SECRET DB' service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing employee email accounts. This significantly elevates the risk of account compromise through various attack vectors such as phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. If an attacker successfully gains access to an employee's email, they could launch further internal attacks, impersonate employees, or access sensitive communications and data. This vulnerability was identified from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee email accounts</li><li>Email system</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This leaves employee workstations and network access points vulnerable to unauthorized access if credentials are stolen, guessed, or compromised. A compromised workstation can serve as a critical pivot point for attackers to move laterally within the network, access internal resources, deploy malware, or escalate privileges. This vulnerability was identified from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee computers</li><li>Network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). Without a clear and communicated AUP, employees may unknowingly engage in activities that pose significant security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive data. This absence increases the likelihood of insider threats, malware infections, data leakage, and non-compliance due to a lack of defined behavioral guidelines for IT resource usage. This vulnerability was identified from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct dedicated security awareness training as part of the onboarding process for new employees. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering attacks due to their unfamiliarity with organizational security protocols, common threats, and internal reporting procedures. This gap leaves the organization vulnerable to phishing, malware, and other human-centric attacks from the moment a new employee joins. While annual training is conducted for all employees, the initial onboarding period is a critical window for establishing a strong security culture. This vulnerability was identified from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified critical and high-severity risks, immediate and strategic actions are required. Firstly, the service running on port 8080, specifically the 'TOP SECRET DB', must be investigated with extreme urgency. Implement robust access controls, strong authentication (preferably MFA), and ensure it is not directly exposed to the internet; if not intended for public access, external blocking should be applied immediately. Secondly, mandate Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and computer logins across the entire organization to significantly enhance protection against credential theft. Thirdly, develop and implement a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) that clearly outlines expected behavior regarding IT resource usage, data handling, and security best practices, ensuring all employees acknowledge and adhere to it. Fourthly, introduce mandatory security awareness training as part of the onboarding process for all new employees, covering common threats, organizational policies, and reporting procedures, to complement the existing annual training. Finally, establish a routine schedule for comprehensive vulnerability scans and penetration tests to proactively identify and remediate new and existing vulnerabilities.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces critical security risks, primarily highlighted by the direct exposure of a 'TOP SECRET DB' on an open port. This is compounded by significant gaps in foundational security practices, including the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for email and computer logins, a lack of an acceptable use policy, and no initial security training for new employees. While annual security awareness training is a positive step, these critical and high-severity vulnerabilities create a highly vulnerable environment that requires immediate and decisive action. Addressing these issues will be paramount to significantly improving the organization's overall security posture and readiness against evolving cyber threats, thereby preventing potential data breaches, unauthorized access, and operational disruptions.</p>
