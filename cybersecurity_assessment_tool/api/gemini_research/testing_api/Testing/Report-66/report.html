        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan data indicates that port 80 is closed. However, a vulnerability assessment identified a potential unencrypted web server on port 80. The organization currently employs Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems but lacks MFA for computer logins. Furthermore, there is an absence of an employee acceptable use policy and no regular security awareness training for new or existing employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unencrypted Web Server - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Port 80 is identified as open, indicating a potential unencrypted web server. This exposes data transmitted over this port to interception and eavesdropping, impacting confidentiality. This was identified through a vulnerability assessment.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are compromised, impacting confidentiality and integrity. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy (AUP). Without an AUP, employees may be unaware of their responsibilities regarding company assets and data, leading to misuse, data breaches, or compliance violations. This impacts integrity and compliance. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT assets</li><li>Organizational data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Security Awareness Training for Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or annually for all employees. This leaves employees vulnerable to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) and unaware of best security practices, increasing the risk of human error leading to security incidents. This impacts confidentiality, integrity, and availability. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>IT systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is recommended to ensure that all web services utilize encryption (e.g., HTTPS/SSL/TLS) and that unencrypted ports like 80 are closed or redirected. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to enhance access control. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to define appropriate conduct and responsibilities. Crucially, establish and regularly conduct security awareness training for all employees, including new hires, to educate them on cybersecurity best practices and threat identification.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing MFA for critical systems like email and sensitive data. However, significant vulnerabilities exist in endpoint access security, policy enforcement, and employee education. Addressing the lack of MFA for computer logins, establishing an acceptable use policy, and implementing regular security awareness training are critical steps to enhance the overall security posture and readiness against common cyber threats. The discrepancy regarding port 80 should also be investigated to ensure accurate vulnerability reporting.</p>
