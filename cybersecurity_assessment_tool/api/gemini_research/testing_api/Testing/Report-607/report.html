        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an active host with an open SSH port (22). Organizational data indicates a lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA) for email access and computer logins, although MFA is used for sensitive data systems. The organization does implement acceptable use policies and regular security awareness training, which are positive aspects of their security posture.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks. If an attacker gains access to an employee's email, it can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and further attacks on internal systems or partners. This vulnerability was identified from the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>All employee email accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This vulnerability is exacerbated by the presence of an open SSH port (22) on an active host, as identified by the network scan. Without MFA, compromised credentials (e.g., through phishing or malware) can grant attackers direct access to internal systems, enabling lateral movement, data theft, and potential system compromise. This was identified from the organizational data and network scan.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All computers</li><li>SSH service (port 22)</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points. Specifically, enable MFA for all email accounts to protect against phishing and credential theft. Additionally, enforce MFA for all computer logins, especially for systems accessible via services like SSH (port 22), to prevent unauthorized access even if primary credentials are compromised. Review SSH configurations to ensure strong authentication methods (e.g., key-based authentication only, disable password authentication) and consider IP whitelisting or VPN requirements for access.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant security risks due to the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for both email access and computer logins. While security awareness training and acceptable use policies are in place, the lack of MFA, particularly in conjunction with an open SSH port, creates critical vulnerabilities that could lead to unauthorized system access and data breaches. Addressing these MFA gaps is paramount to enhancing the organization's overall security posture and readiness against modern cyber threats.</p>
