            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network scan identified one active host. While port 80 was reported as closed in the scan, a critical vulnerability assessment indicates an unencrypted web server is present with port 80 open. Organizational policies reveal a lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, though MFA is utilized for sensitive data systems. Furthermore, there is no employee acceptable use policy in place, and security awareness training is not conducted for new employees, although annual training is provided for all staff.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Unencrypted Web Server",
                        "Overview": "An unencrypted web server was identified with port 80 open. This exposes web traffic to potential eavesdropping and data interception, compromising the confidentiality and integrity of data transmitted over this channel. The risk was identified through a vulnerability assessment.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Port 80"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately address the unencrypted web server by either closing port 80 if it's not intended for public access, or by implementing SSL/TLS encryption to secure all web traffic. Furthermore, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) should be implemented for all email access and computer logins to significantly enhance authentication security. The organization should also develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to define appropriate technology usage. Finally, security awareness training should be extended to new employees as part of their onboarding process to ensure a consistent level of security understanding across the entire workforce from day one.",
            "Conclusion": "In conclusion, the organization exhibits a mixed state of cybersecurity readiness. While annual security awareness training and MFA for sensitive data systems are positive aspects, significant vulnerabilities exist, including an unencrypted web server and critical gaps in authentication security due to the absence of MFA for email and computer logins. The lack of an employee acceptable use policy and initial security training for new hires further exacerbates the risk posture. Addressing these identified vulnerabilities and policy gaps is crucial for improving the overall security posture and reducing the likelihood of successful cyberattacks."
