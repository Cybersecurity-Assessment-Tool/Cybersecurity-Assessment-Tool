        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network shows an open HTTP port (80), which could be an entry point if not properly secured. While multi-factor authentication (MFA) is consistently applied for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, significant gaps exist in foundational security practices. Specifically, there is no employee acceptable use policy, and new employees do not receive security awareness training, although annual training is conducted for all staff.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The absence of an Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) means there are no formal guidelines for employees regarding the appropriate use of organizational IT resources. This can lead to misuse of company assets, increased risk of data breaches, and legal liabilities. Identified from organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All Employees</li><li>Organizational IT Resources</li><li>Data Integrity</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees are not receiving security awareness training upon onboarding. This leaves them vulnerable to common cyber threats like phishing, social engineering, and malware, potentially compromising organizational security from day one. Identified from organizational training policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New Employees</li><li>Organizational Network</li><li>Data Security</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open HTTP Port (80) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open HTTP port (80) was detected on the network. While not a direct vulnerability, an unencrypted HTTP service can expose sensitive information in transit and may indicate an outdated web server or a lack of HTTPS enforcement. This port could also be a target for various web-based attacks if the underlying service is not properly secured and patched. Identified via Nmap scan.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Network Perimeter</li><li>Web Server (Port 80)</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>It is strongly recommended that the organization develop and implement a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) to establish clear guidelines for IT resource usage. Furthermore, immediate action should be taken to integrate mandatory security awareness training into the onboarding process for all new employees. For the open HTTP port 80, it is crucial to ensure that all web services are configured to use HTTPS exclusively, redirecting all HTTP traffic, and that the underlying web server software is fully patched and securely configured. Regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing should be conducted to identify and remediate further potential weaknesses.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to multi-factor authentication across critical access points. However, significant foundational security weaknesses exist, particularly concerning employee policies and initial security training. The presence of an open HTTP port also warrants immediate attention. Addressing these areas is crucial for enhancing the overall security posture and reducing the attack surface.</p>
