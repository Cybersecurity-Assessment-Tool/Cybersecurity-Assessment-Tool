        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open MySQL port (3306) running version 5.7.33, indicating a potential database exposure. Internally, the organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and maintains an employee acceptable use policy. Furthermore, security awareness training is conducted for both new employees and annually for all staff. However, MFA is not required for accessing email or sensitive data systems, which represents a significant security gap.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network, potentially exposing the database to unauthorized access. This was identified through network scanning, showing the service running MySQL version 5.7.33 on this port. An open database port can lead to data breaches, unauthorized data manipulation, or denial of service if exploited.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted internal IP addresses or specific application servers. For a more robust long-term solution, consider placing the database behind a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or implementing a secure bastion host for administrative access. Additionally, it is critical to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised. While the organization has strong security awareness training and an acceptable use policy, these MFA implementations are crucial steps to enhance overall security posture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In conclusion, the organization exhibits a mixed security posture. Positive aspects include regular security awareness training, an employee acceptable use policy, and MFA for computer logins. However, significant vulnerabilities exist, primarily the exposed MySQL port and the lack of MFA for email and sensitive data systems. Addressing these critical gaps through immediate firewall adjustments and strategic MFA deployment is essential to improve the organization's readiness against potential cyber threats and protect sensitive information.</p>
