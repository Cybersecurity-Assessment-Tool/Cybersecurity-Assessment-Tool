        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network security posture, based on available organizational data, indicates a mixed level of readiness. While an acceptable use policy is in place and annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees, significant gaps exist in the implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and initial security training for new hires. The lack of detailed network scan data prevents a comprehensive technical assessment of infrastructure vulnerabilities.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate MFA for Computer Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for employees to log into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication. An attacker gaining access to a single set of credentials could potentially compromise an employee's workstation, leading to further internal network access. This was identified from the 'Org Data'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Laptops</li><li>User accounts</li><li>Domain controllers</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if user credentials are compromised. A breach of these systems could lead to severe data loss, regulatory non-compliance (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA), significant financial penalties, and severe reputational damage. This was identified from the 'Org Data'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data repositories</li><li>Databases</li><li>Applications handling sensitive information</li><li>User accounts with access to sensitive systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient New Employee Security Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees upon onboarding. This means new hires may not be immediately aware of critical security policies, best practices, and common threats such as phishing, social engineering, and malware. This gap increases the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents during their initial employment period, despite annual training being provided to all employees. This was identified from the 'Org Data'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li><li>Email systems</li><li>Internal networks</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points. Specifically, MFA should be mandated for all computer logins and, most critically, for access to all sensitive data systems. Furthermore, a comprehensive security awareness training program should be established for all new employees as part of their onboarding process, ensuring they are immediately equipped with the knowledge to identify and mitigate common cyber threats. Regular review and updates of security policies and training materials are also advised.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Based on the available organizational data, the organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security through its acceptable use policy and annual security awareness training. However, critical vulnerabilities exist due to the absence of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, posing a significant risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. The lack of initial security training for new employees also presents a notable human risk factor. Addressing these key areas is paramount to improving the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and reducing its attack surface.</p>
