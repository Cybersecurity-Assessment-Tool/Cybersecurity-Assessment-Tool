        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Based on the provided organizational data, the organization has implemented security awareness training for new employees and conducts annual training for all employees, indicating a foundational commitment to human-centric security. An acceptable use policy is also in place. However, critical gaps exist in multi-factor authentication (MFA) implementation. MFA is required for sensitive data systems, but it is not mandated for email access or computer logins. No network scan data or specific vulnerability findings were available for analysis, limiting the scope of this assessment to policy and procedural observations.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. A successful compromise could lead to business email compromise (BEC) attacks, data exfiltration, or further lateral movement within the network. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on email access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email System</li><li>Employee Accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if user credentials are stolen or guessed. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to a workstation, potentially leading to malware deployment, data theft, or network pivot points. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on computer logins.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations</li><li>Servers (if applicable)</li><li>Employee Accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified high-severity risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and computer logins. For email, consider solutions that integrate with existing email platforms and offer various MFA methods (e.g., authenticator apps, hardware tokens). For computer logins, explore operating system-level MFA integrations or third-party solutions that enforce MFA before granting access to workstations and servers. Additionally, while security awareness training is in place, reinforce the importance of strong, unique passwords and the benefits of MFA during these sessions. Regularly review and update security policies to ensure they reflect current best practices and address emerging threats.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a good foundation in security awareness training and acceptable use policies. However, the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for email access and computer logins represents critical vulnerabilities that significantly elevate the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches. While MFA is correctly applied to sensitive data systems, extending it to email and computer logins is paramount for improving the overall security posture and readiness against common cyber threats. A comprehensive assessment including network scan data would provide a more complete picture of the organization's readiness.</p>
