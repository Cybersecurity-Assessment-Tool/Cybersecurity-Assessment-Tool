        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's current security posture, based on available data, indicates significant vulnerabilities related to user authentication and security awareness training. While an acceptable use policy is in place and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is used for sensitive data systems, there are critical gaps in MFA implementation for email and computer logins. Furthermore, the absence of both initial and recurring security awareness training for employees presents a substantial human-factor risk, leaving the organization susceptible to social engineering and other common cyber threats.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to email in the event of compromised credentials (e.g., via phishing or brute-force attacks). Email accounts often contain sensitive information and can be used as a pivot point for further attacks within the organization. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on email access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email accounts</li><li>Email servers</li><li>User credentials</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This leaves computer systems vulnerable to unauthorized access if user credentials are stolen or guessed. Without a second factor, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to a workstation, potentially leading to data breaches, malware infection, or lateral movement within the network. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on computer login.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>User workstations</li><li>User accounts</li><li>Sensitive data on endpoints</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. This means new hires may not be adequately informed about common cybersecurity threats (e.g., phishing, social engineering, malware), organizational security policies, and best practices from day one. This lack of initial training increases the likelihood of new employees inadvertently introducing security risks or falling victim to attacks. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for security awareness training for new employees.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. Regular training is crucial to keep employees updated on evolving threats, reinforce security best practices, and maintain a strong security culture. Without annual training, employees may forget previous lessons, become complacent, or be unaware of new attack vectors, making the organization more susceptible to human-factor related incidents. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for annual security awareness training.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and computer logins. This will provide a crucial additional layer of security against credential theft. Furthermore, establishing a comprehensive security awareness training program is paramount. This program should include mandatory training for all new employees upon onboarding and annual refresher training for all existing employees to ensure they are continuously informed about evolving threats and best security practices. Regularly reviewing and updating security policies will also help maintain an adaptive defense strategy.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces notable cybersecurity risks primarily due to the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for email and computer access, and a complete lack of security awareness training for both new and existing employees. While some foundational elements like an acceptable use policy and MFA for sensitive data systems are present, these critical gaps in user authentication and human-factor defenses leave the organization vulnerable to common attack vectors such as phishing, credential compromise, and social engineering. Addressing these areas is essential to improve overall readiness and reduce the likelihood of a successful cyberattack.</p>
