        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open SSH port (22), indicating potential remote access capabilities. From an organizational policy standpoint, the company has implemented security awareness training for all employees, including new hires, which is a positive step. However, critical gaps exist in multi-factor authentication (MFA) implementation, as it is not required for computer logins or access to sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the absence of an employee acceptable use policy leaves the organization vulnerable to various internal security risks.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port (22) - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nmap scan identified an open SSH port (22) on at least one host. While SSH is a legitimate service for secure remote access, an open port presents a potential attack surface. If not properly secured with strong authentication, rate limiting, and regular patching, it can be exploited for brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or unauthorized access, leading to system compromise.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host(s) with open port 22</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require multi-factor authentication (MFA) for employees to log into their computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen, phished, or brute-forced. A single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to an employee's workstation and potentially the internal network, bypassing other security controls.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee workstations and associated login systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-factor authentication is not enforced for accessing sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk to data confidentiality and integrity. If an attacker gains access to a single set of credentials, they can potentially access, exfiltrate, or tamper with sensitive organizational data without an additional layer of security. This could lead to severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All sensitive data systems and their access mechanisms</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy (AUP). An AUP defines the proper and improper use of company IT resources, including computers, networks, and data. Without clear guidelines, employees may inadvertently engage in risky behaviors (e.g., installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, sharing sensitive information inappropriately) that could introduce malware, facilitate data leaks, or violate compliance requirements. This lack of policy creates ambiguity and increases the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>IT systems</li><li>Data</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, the following recommendations are provided: 1. Secure SSH Access: Implement robust security measures for all SSH services. This includes using strong, complex passwords or, preferably, SSH key-based authentication, disabling root login, configuring rate limiting for failed login attempts, and ensuring SSH servers are regularly patched and updated. Consider restricting SSH access to specific IP ranges or internal networks where possible. 2. Implement MFA for Computer Logins: Mandate multi-factor authentication for all computer logins across the organization. This significantly enhances security by requiring a second form of verification beyond a password, making it much harder for attackers to gain unauthorized access even if they compromise credentials. 3. Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems: Enforce multi-factor authentication for all access points to systems containing sensitive data. This is a critical control to protect against data breaches and ensure that only authorized individuals with multiple forms of authentication can access high-value assets. 4. Develop and Enforce an Employee Acceptable Use Policy: Create a comprehensive acceptable use policy that clearly outlines employee responsibilities and expectations regarding the use of company IT resources. This policy should be communicated to all employees, acknowledged, and regularly reinforced through security awareness training. 5. Regular Vulnerability Scanning and Patch Management: Continue regular network scans to identify open ports and services, and establish a robust patch management program to ensure all systems and software are up-to-date with the latest security patches.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security through its consistent security awareness training programs. However, significant vulnerabilities exist, primarily due to the lack of multi-factor authentication for computer logins and sensitive data systems, which are critical controls for preventing unauthorized access and data breaches. The presence of an open SSH port, if not adequately secured, also presents a high-risk entry point. Furthermore, the absence of an acceptable use policy leaves the organization susceptible to human error and internal misuse of resources. Addressing these critical gaps by implementing MFA across key access points, securing remote access services, and establishing clear employee usage policies is paramount to enhancing the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and readiness against evolving threats.</p>
