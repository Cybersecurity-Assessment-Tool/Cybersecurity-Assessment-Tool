            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network currently presents an open port 80, indicating an unencrypted web service. While an acceptable use policy is in place and annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees, critical gaps exist in the security posture. Specifically, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not enforced for email access or computer logins, significantly increasing the risk of credential compromise and unauthorized access. Furthermore, new employees do not receive initial security awareness training, leaving them vulnerable to common cyber threats during their onboarding period.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Unencrypted Web Traffic",
                        "Overview": "An open port 80 indicates that a web server is accessible via HTTP. This protocol transmits data, including potentially sensitive information, in plain text, making it susceptible to eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attacks, and session hijacking. The lack of encryption exposes user credentials and other data to interception, compromising data confidentiality and integrity.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require MFA for email access. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. If an attacker obtains a user's email password, they gain full access to the email account, which can be used for further attacks, password resets, and access to other linked services, leading to data breaches and business disruption.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require MFA for computer logins. This leaves internal systems vulnerable to unauthorized access if a user's login credentials are stolen or guessed. An attacker with a compromised password could gain direct access to an employee's workstation and potentially pivot to other systems within the network, leading to internal network compromise and data exfiltration.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                    {
                        "Risk": "Insufficient Security Awareness Training for New Employees",
                        "Overview": "New employees do not receive initial security awareness training. This leaves them unprepared for common cyber threats such as phishing, social engineering, and malware. New hires are often targeted by attackers who exploit their lack of familiarity with organizational security policies and procedures, increasing the risk of successful attacks and potentially introducing vulnerabilities into the organization's environment.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "New employees",
                            "Organizational security posture"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement HTTPS for all web services, ensuring all traffic over port 80 is redirected to port 443 with a valid SSL/TLS certificate. Immediately enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and computer logins to significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials. Additionally, establish a mandatory security awareness training program specifically for all new employees as part of their onboarding process, covering essential topics like phishing recognition, password hygiene, and social engineering tactics. Regular audits of security configurations and employee training effectiveness should also be conducted.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces significant vulnerabilities primarily due to the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for critical access points (email and computer logins) and an unencrypted web service. While some foundational security practices like an acceptable use policy and annual training are in place, the lack of initial training for new hires and the critical MFA gaps indicate a moderate to high overall risk posture. Addressing these issues promptly is crucial to enhance the organization's readiness against common cyber threats and prevent potential data breaches or unauthorized system access."
