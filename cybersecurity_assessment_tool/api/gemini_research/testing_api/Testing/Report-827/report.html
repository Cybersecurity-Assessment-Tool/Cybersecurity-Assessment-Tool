        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization currently employs Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access, which is a positive security measure. However, critical gaps exist in MFA implementation for computer logins and sensitive data systems, significantly increasing the risk of unauthorized access. While an acceptable use policy is in place, there is a complete absence of security awareness training for both new and existing employees, leaving the organization vulnerable to social engineering and human error. Network scans indicate an open SSH port (22), which, if not properly secured, presents a potential entry point for attackers. The overall security posture shows a mix of basic controls with significant deficiencies in access management and employee education.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This vulnerability indicates that a localhost service or interface is accessible from an external or unintended network segment. This could expose internal services, configuration files, or sensitive data to unauthorized parties, potentially leading to information disclosure or further network penetration. The identification of this risk suggests a misconfiguration in network segmentation or service binding.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The absence of MFA for computer logins means that a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's workstation and potentially the internal network. This significantly increases the risk of lateral movement, data exfiltration, and ransomware attacks, as password-only authentication is highly susceptible to brute-force, phishing, and credential stuffing attacks.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers</li><li>Internal network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Without MFA protecting access to sensitive data systems, any compromise of a user's credentials directly exposes critical and confidential information. This poses an extreme risk for data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, financial loss, and reputational damage. The impact is severe due to the direct access to high-value assets.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases containing confidential information</li><li>Cloud storage for sensitive files</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees, without proper security awareness training, are more susceptible to social engineering tactics, phishing attempts, and unknowingly introducing vulnerabilities into the network. This lack of initial education can lead to immediate security incidents and a weak security culture from the outset.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security culture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Without regular, annual security awareness training, employees may forget best practices, fail to recognize evolving threats, and become complacent. This increases the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents, such as clicking malicious links, falling for phishing scams, or mishandling sensitive information over time.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port (22) - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH port (22) on a network-accessible host, if not adequately secured, presents a direct target for attackers. It can be exploited through brute-force attacks to guess credentials, or through known vulnerabilities in the SSH service itself. Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized remote access, command execution, and further compromise of the host and internal network.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with open port 22</li><li>Network perimeter</li><li>SSH service configuration</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, immediate action is required across several key areas. Firstly, implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and, critically, for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access even if passwords are compromised. Secondly, establish a comprehensive security awareness training program, ensuring all new employees receive initial training and all staff undergo annual refresher courses to educate them on current threats and best practices. Furthermore, the open SSH port (22) must be secured by implementing strong access controls, such as restricting access to known IP addresses, enforcing key-based authentication, disabling root login, and regularly patching the SSH service. Finally, investigate and remediate the "Localhost Exposed" vulnerability by ensuring proper network segmentation and service binding to prevent unintended exposure of internal services.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently exhibits a mixed security posture, with some foundational controls like MFA for email and an acceptable use policy in place. However, significant vulnerabilities exist, particularly concerning the lack of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, and a complete absence of security awareness training for all employees. The presence of an open SSH port and an exposed localhost further compounds these risks, creating multiple potential entry points for attackers and increasing the likelihood of a successful breach. Addressing these critical gaps is paramount to improving the organization's overall readiness against cyber threats and protecting its valuable assets.</p>
