        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization currently implements Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and has established an employee acceptable use policy. Furthermore, security awareness training is conducted for both new employees and annually for all employees. However, critical gaps exist in the implementation of MFA for computer logins and access to sensitive data systems, which significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access. Due to broken input data, a comprehensive network scan and detailed vulnerability assessment could not be performed for technical vulnerabilities.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for employees to log into their computers. This means that if an attacker compromises a single set of login credentials (username and password), they could gain unauthorized access to an employee's workstation and potentially the internal network. The impact could range from data exfiltration to malware deployment, leading to significant operational disruption and data breaches. This was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee workstations</li><li>Internal network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk as compromised credentials could grant direct access to confidential information, intellectual property, or customer data. The impact of such a breach could include severe financial penalties, reputational damage, and loss of customer trust. This was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases containing confidential information</li><li>File shares with sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all employee computer logins and for all sensitive data systems. For computer logins, consider solutions that integrate with existing directory services (e.g., Active Directory) and offer various MFA methods (e.g., authenticator apps, hardware tokens). For sensitive data systems, ensure that access controls are robust and that MFA is a mandatory requirement for all users, including administrators. Additionally, while current security awareness training is in place, it should be updated to specifically highlight the importance of MFA and best practices for protecting credentials, especially in the context of systems where MFA is not yet enforced. A full network scan and vulnerability assessment should be conducted once data input issues are resolved to identify and address any technical vulnerabilities.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security through its use of MFA for email, an acceptable use policy, and regular security awareness training. However, the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for computer logins and sensitive data systems represents critical vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. Addressing these gaps by implementing comprehensive MFA across these critical access points is paramount to mitigating the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and maintaining a robust security posture. A complete assessment of technical vulnerabilities requires functional scan data.</p>
