        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network assessment revealed an active host with an open port 8080, which appears to be hosting a sensitive database interface titled "TOP SECRET DB". Internally, while Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for email and computer logins, a critical gap exists as MFA is not required for accessing sensitive data systems. The organization does maintain an acceptable use policy and conducts regular security awareness training for employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed Sensitive Database Interface - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open port 8080 was identified, hosting a service with the title "TOP SECRET DB". This indicates a potentially sensitive database interface or application is directly accessible from the network. Direct exposure of such systems without proper authentication or access controls poses a critical risk of unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or system compromise. The service was identified via an Nmap HTTP title script.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li><li>Service with title 'TOP SECRET DB'</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Authentication for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical data in the event of compromised credentials (e.g., due to phishing, malware, or brute-force attacks). Without MFA, a single factor (username/password) is sufficient for authentication, making these systems highly vulnerable.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Authentication mechanisms</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediate action is required to address the exposed "TOP SECRET DB" on port 8080. This service should be immediately removed from public exposure, placed behind a robust firewall, and secured with strong authentication and access controls. A thorough investigation into the nature and contents of this "TOP SECRET DB" is paramount. Furthermore, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be implemented without delay for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access through compromised credentials. Regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing should be conducted to identify and remediate similar exposures.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security through its acceptable use policy and security awareness training programs. However, significant vulnerabilities were identified, particularly the direct exposure of a "TOP SECRET DB" interface on port 8080 and the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems. These issues represent critical and high-severity risks that could lead to severe data breaches or system compromises if not addressed promptly. The organization's readiness is compromised by these critical security gaps, necessitating urgent remediation efforts to bolster its overall security posture.</p>
