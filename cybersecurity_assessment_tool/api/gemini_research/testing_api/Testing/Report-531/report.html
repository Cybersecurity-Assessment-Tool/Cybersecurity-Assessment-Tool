        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes a MySQL database on port 3306. Internally, while security awareness training is conducted for all employees, there are critical gaps in access controls, specifically the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the lack of an employee acceptable use policy introduces potential risks related to employee conduct and IT resource usage.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network, potentially allowing unauthorized access to the database. This increases the risk of data breaches, unauthorized data manipulation, or denial of service if the database is not adequately secured. The vulnerability was identified through network scanning revealing an open port for MySQL.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Email access without Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if employee credentials are compromised through phishing, malware, or other means. An attacker gaining access to an email account can lead to business email compromise, data exfiltration, impersonation, and further lateral movement within the organization. This was identified through organizational policy review indicating no MFA requirement for email.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Access to sensitive data systems without Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) poses a critical risk. If an attacker obtains primary credentials, they can access and potentially exfiltrate or tamper with critical sensitive data without an additional layer of security. This can lead to severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and significant reputational damage. This was identified through organizational policy review indicating no MFA requirement for sensitive data systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Without a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), employees may not be fully aware of their responsibilities and the guidelines for using company IT resources, handling data, and maintaining security. This lack of clear policy can lead to increased instances of misuse, higher risk of malware infections, data leakage, and inconsistent employee behavior regarding cybersecurity best practices. This was identified through organizational policy review indicating no existing AUP.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from authorized internal systems. For a long-term solution, consider placing the database behind a VPN or within a more isolated network segment. Crucially, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be mandated and implemented for all email access and sensitive data systems to significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access even if primary credentials are compromised. Furthermore, develop and implement a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), ensuring all employees are trained on its contents and acknowledge their understanding and compliance. This policy should clearly define appropriate use of company IT resources, data handling, and security responsibilities. Regular security audits and penetration testing should also be conducted to proactively identify and address new vulnerabilities.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization faces significant security risks primarily due to an exposed database service and critical gaps in access control mechanisms, specifically the lack of MFA for email and sensitive data systems. The absence of an acceptable use policy further exacerbates potential internal risks related to employee conduct. While security awareness training is in place, these fundamental vulnerabilities severely impact the organization's overall readiness against cyber threats. Addressing these issues promptly is crucial to enhance the security posture and protect sensitive assets from potential breaches and misuse.</p>
