        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open port 8080 exposing a service titled "TOP SECRET DB". This indicates a critical exposure of potentially sensitive data. Furthermore, the organization lacks multi-factor authentication for email and computer logins, and does not have an employee acceptable use policy. Security awareness training for all employees is not conducted annually.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed "TOP SECRET DB" on Port 8080 - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open port 8080 was identified, hosting a service with the title "TOP SECRET DB". This directly exposes a potentially sensitive database or application to the network, which could be accessible from external networks if not properly firewalled. The presence of such a service title strongly suggests that critical data may be at risk of unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or manipulation. This was identified via an Nmap scan with the http-title script.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li><li>TOP SECRET DB service/application</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing, as a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to an employee's email. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee email accounts</li><li>Email server</li><li>Organizational communication</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for logging into computers within the organization. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if employee credentials are stolen or guessed, potentially leading to lateral movement within the network and access to internal resources. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network endpoints</li><li>Internal network resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not have an employee acceptable use policy in place. This lack of clear guidelines means employees may not be aware of appropriate and inappropriate use of company IT resources, increasing the risk of misuse, accidental data breaches, or introduction of malware. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee behavior</li><li>IT systems</li><li>Data integrity</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Infrequent Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, all employees are not trained at least once per year. This infrequent training schedule means employees may not be kept up-to-date on the latest threats, best practices, and organizational policies, leading to a decline in security posture over time and increased susceptibility to social engineering attacks. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee awareness</li><li>Organizational security culture</li><li>Susceptibility to social engineering</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>The "TOP SECRET DB" exposed on port 8080 must be immediately investigated. Determine if this service is intentionally exposed and, if so, ensure it is protected by robust authentication, authorization, and network segmentation (e.g., firewall rules restricting access to only necessary internal IPs). If it is not intended to be exposed, it should be immediately taken offline or moved behind a secure gateway. Mandate Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and computer logins across the organization. This is a fundamental security control that significantly reduces the risk of credential-based attacks. Create and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy. Ensure all employees are trained on this policy and acknowledge their understanding and compliance. Establish a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees. The training should cover current threats, phishing awareness, data handling best practices, and the acceptable use policy. Conduct regular, authenticated and unauthenticated, network vulnerability scans to identify and remediate new exposures proactively.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization faces critical security risks primarily due to an exposed "TOP SECRET DB" service on port 8080, which presents an immediate and severe threat of data compromise. Furthermore, the absence of multi-factor authentication for email and computer logins, coupled with a lack of an acceptable use policy and infrequent security awareness training, indicates significant gaps in foundational security controls and employee education. Addressing these vulnerabilities is paramount to improving the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and protecting its sensitive assets.</p>
