        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently presents several critical security vulnerabilities. An FTP server running an outdated version of vsftpd (2.3.4) is openly accessible and allows anonymous login, posing a significant risk of unauthorized access and potential exploitation of known vulnerabilities. Furthermore, a substantial portion of workstations are operating on Windows 7, an end-of-life operating system, leaving them highly susceptible to modern cyber threats. From an organizational policy standpoint, there is a critical lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for both email and computer logins, although MFA is used for sensitive data systems. The absence of an employee acceptable use policy and the lack of annual security awareness training for all employees further exacerbate the overall risk posture, indicating a need for immediate and comprehensive security enhancements.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Anonymous FTP Login & Outdated vsftpd - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The FTP server, identified as vsftpd version 2.3.4, is configured to allow anonymous login. This configuration can lead to unauthorized access to files, data leakage, and potential server compromise. Furthermore, vsftpd 2.3.4 is an outdated version known to have a critical backdoor vulnerability (CVE-2011-2523), making the server highly susceptible to remote code execution. This was identified via an Nmap scan on port 21.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>FTP Server (vsftpd 2.3.4)</li><li>Port 21</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Windows Operating System (Windows 7) - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A significant number of workstations are running Windows 7, an operating system that has reached its end-of-life and no longer receives security updates from Microsoft. This exposes these systems to a multitude of known and newly discovered vulnerabilities, making them prime targets for malware, ransomware, and other cyberattacks, severely compromising the integrity and confidentiality of data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations running Windows 7</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks. A single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's email, leading to data breaches, business email compromise (BEC) scams, and further lateral movement within the network.</p>

                <ul><li>Email System</li><li>Employee Accounts</li></ul>

            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for logging into computers within the organization. This leaves workstations and potentially other network resources vulnerable to password-based attacks. If an attacker obtains an employee's password, they can gain unauthorized access to the computer, potentially escalating privileges and accessing sensitive data or systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations</li><li>Employee Accounts</li><li>Network Access</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines, employees may unknowingly engage in activities that pose security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling company data. This absence increases the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents and potential legal liabilities.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All Employees</li><li>IT Resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This means that existing employees may not be updated on the latest cyber threats, best practices, and organizational policies, making them more susceptible to social engineering attacks, phishing, and other evolving threats.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All Employees</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To address the identified critical vulnerabilities, it is strongly recommended to immediately disable anonymous FTP access and either upgrade the vsftpd server to a current, supported version or decommission it if not essential. All workstations running Windows 7 must be upgraded to a currently supported operating system, such as Windows 10 or 11, to ensure they receive vital security updates. Implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and computer logins is a critical step to significantly enhance credential security and prevent unauthorized access. Furthermore, the organization should develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to provide clear guidelines for IT resource usage. Finally, a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees should be established to keep the workforce informed about evolving cyber threats and best security practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces a high level of cybersecurity risk due to several critical vulnerabilities, including an outdated and insecure FTP server, end-of-life operating systems on workstations, and a significant lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for core services. These technical weaknesses, combined with gaps in security policies and employee training, create an environment highly susceptible to cyberattacks. While MFA is in place for sensitive data systems, the overall readiness is low, necessitating immediate and proactive measures to mitigate these risks and strengthen the organization's security posture.</p>
