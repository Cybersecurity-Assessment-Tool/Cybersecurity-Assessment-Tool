            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network currently features an FTP server running vsftpd 2.3.4, which allows anonymous login. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required for logging into computers and accessing sensitive data systems, it is notably absent for email access. The organization has an acceptable use policy in place, but there is a significant gap in security awareness training, as it is not provided for new employees nor annually for all staff. Additionally, several workstations are operating on outdated Windows 7 systems.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Anonymous FTP Access",
                        "Overview": "The network scan identified an FTP server (vsftpd 2.3.4) allowing anonymous login. This configuration enables unauthorized users to access, upload, or download files without authentication, posing a significant risk of data exposure, unauthorized data modification, or the potential for malware distribution through the server. This vulnerability was identified via an Nmap scan targeting port 21.",
                        "Severity": "High",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Email",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of email account compromise through common attack vectors such as phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. A single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to an employee's email, potentially leading to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, or further internal network access. This was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Email system",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Insufficient Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees, nor does it provide annual training for all staff. This lack of regular education leaves employees vulnerable to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting), malware, and other common cyber threats. Employees may not be equipped to identify or report suspicious activities, increasing the likelihood of successful attacks that could compromise organizational data and systems. This was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                    {
                        "Risk": "Outdated Operating Systems (Windows 7)",
                        "Overview": "Several workstations are running Windows 7, an operating system that has reached its end-of-life and no longer receives security updates from Microsoft. This exposes these systems to known and unpatched vulnerabilities, making them easy targets for attackers. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to malware infection, data compromise, and potential lateral movement within the network. This was identified through a review of current risks.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Workstations running Windows 7"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is imperative to immediately disable anonymous FTP access on the vsftpd server and implement robust authentication and authorization controls. An upgrade of vsftpd to a current, supported version is also highly recommended. Mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be implemented for all email accounts to drastically reduce the risk of account compromise. Furthermore, a comprehensive security awareness training program should be established, including mandatory training for all new hires and annual refresher courses for all employees, covering topics such as phishing, strong password practices, and secure data handling. Finally, all workstations running Windows 7 must be upgraded to a currently supported operating system (e.g., Windows 10 or 11) to ensure they receive critical security updates, and a hardware refresh plan should be developed for systems unable to support newer OS versions.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces several critical security vulnerabilities, including an anonymously accessible FTP server and a significant gap in email security due to the lack of MFA. These issues, combined with the absence of regular security awareness training and the continued use of outdated Windows 7 workstations, expose the organization to a high risk of data breaches, account compromises, and successful cyberattacks. Addressing these vulnerabilities through immediate technical remediation and strategic policy implementation is crucial for enhancing the organization's overall security posture and readiness against evolving cyber threats."
