        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open port 80. Furthermore, an assessment of organizational policies indicates a lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and an absence of regular security awareness training for both new and existing employees. While MFA is in place for computer logins and sensitive data systems, and an acceptable use policy is present, these gaps represent significant vulnerabilities.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open Port 80 - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open port 80 was detected during the network scan. This port is typically used for HTTP traffic. If not properly secured or if running outdated web services, it can expose the organization to various web-based attacks, including cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. The impact could range from data breaches to system compromise.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li><li>Web Server (if applicable)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. If an attacker gains access to an employee's email, they could impersonate the employee, access sensitive information, or launch further attacks within the organization.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee email accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires may not be aware of common cybersecurity threats, organizational security policies, or best practices, making them more susceptible to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) and increasing the likelihood of accidental security incidents.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Annual Security Awareness Training for All Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. Without regular training, employees may forget best practices, fail to recognize evolving threats, or become complacent. This oversight can lead to a decline in the overall security posture, making the organization more vulnerable to human-factor risks.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts to prevent unauthorized access. Furthermore, comprehensive security awareness training programs should be established for all new employees upon onboarding and conducted annually for all existing employees. This training should cover topics such as phishing recognition, password hygiene, data handling, and incident reporting. For the open port 80, a thorough review of the services running on this port is crucial. If a web server is active, ensure it is patched, configured securely, and protected by a web application firewall (WAF). If the port is not intentionally open, it should be closed immediately.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several significant security vulnerabilities, primarily stemming from a lack of robust access controls for email and insufficient employee security awareness training. The presence of an open port 80 also presents a potential entry point for attackers. While MFA is in place for computer logins and sensitive data systems, and an acceptable use policy exists, the identified gaps in email security and human-factor defenses, coupled with potential network exposure, indicate a moderate to high overall risk posture. Addressing these issues promptly through the recommended actions is essential to enhance the organization's cybersecurity readiness and reduce its susceptibility to common attack vectors.</p>
