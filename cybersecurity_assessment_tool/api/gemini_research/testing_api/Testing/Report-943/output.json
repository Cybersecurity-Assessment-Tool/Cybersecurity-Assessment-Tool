            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network scan identified an open SSH port (22). While some foundational security measures are in place, such as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems, significant gaps exist in endpoint security and human-factor controls. Specifically, MFA is not required for computer logins, there is no employee acceptable use policy, and security awareness training is not conducted annually for all employees.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Unsecured SSH Access",
                        "Overview": "An open SSH port (22) was detected on the network. Without proper hardening measures, such as disabling password authentication, enforcing key-based authentication, implementing rate limiting, and ensuring regular patching, this port can be a target for brute-force attacks or credential stuffing. Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to internal systems, potentially compromising data or allowing further network penetration.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Port 22 on detected hosts"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Logins",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require MFA for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee workstations and internal systems. If an attacker obtains employee credentials through phishing, malware, or other means, they can gain direct access without needing a second factor, leading to potential data breaches, malware propagation, or lateral movement within the network.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employee computers/workstations"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy",
                        "Overview": "The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines on the proper and acceptable use of company IT resources, employees may inadvertently engage in risky behaviors. This includes installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive data, which increases the likelihood of malware infections, data leakage, and potential compliance violations.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "Company IT resources"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Insufficient Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "While new employees receive security awareness training, it is not conducted for all employees at least once per year. This means existing employees may not be updated on the latest cyber threats, phishing techniques, or evolving company security policies. A lack of ongoing training leads to a degradation of the overall security posture over time, increasing the risk of human error-related security incidents.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All existing employees",
                            "Overall organizational security posture"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is recommended to implement robust hardening measures for all SSH services, including disabling password authentication, enforcing strong key-based authentication, and implementing rate limiting. Crucially, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be implemented and enforced for all computer logins to significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access from compromised credentials. The organization should develop and formally implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy, ensuring all employees are trained on its contents and acknowledge their understanding. Furthermore, a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees should be established to keep staff informed about current threats, best practices, and policy updates.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently exhibits a mixed security posture. While some critical areas like email and sensitive data systems benefit from MFA, significant vulnerabilities exist in endpoint access control, policy enforcement, and ongoing employee security education. The presence of an open SSH port also presents a potential attack surface. Addressing these identified gaps through the recommended actions is essential to enhance the overall security readiness and resilience against common cyber threats, thereby protecting organizational assets and data more effectively."
