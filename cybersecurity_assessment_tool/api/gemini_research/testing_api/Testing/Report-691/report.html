        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization currently employs Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems, demonstrating a commitment to securing critical access points. Furthermore, security awareness training is regularly conducted for both new and existing employees, which is a positive step in fostering a security-conscious culture. However, a significant gap exists as MFA is not mandated for computer logins, increasing the risk of unauthorized access to workstations. Additionally, the absence of an employee acceptable use policy leaves the organization vulnerable to misuse of IT resources and potential data breaches. A network scan also revealed an open SSH port (22), which, while potentially legitimate, represents an attack surface if not adequately secured and monitored.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee workstations and the internal network if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or other means. A single compromised password could grant an attacker full access, bypassing a critical layer of security. This vulnerability was identified from the 'Org Data' indicating 'Do you require MFA to log into computers?':'No'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Internal network access points</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy (AUP). An AUP is crucial for defining the proper and improper use of company assets, networks, and data, setting clear expectations for employee behavior. Without an AUP, employees may inadvertently or intentionally engage in activities that pose security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or sharing sensitive information inappropriately, without clear guidelines or consequences. This was identified from the 'Org Data' stating 'Does your organization have an employee acceptable use policy?':'No'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li><li>Company assets</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port (22) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A network scan identified an open SSH (Secure Shell) port (22). While SSH is a legitimate and secure protocol for remote access, an open port presents a potential attack surface if not properly secured. Without robust configurations such as strong authentication (e.g., key-based authentication, disabling password authentication), IP-based access restrictions, rate limiting, and regular patching, this port can be targeted by brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or exploited for known SSH vulnerabilities, potentially leading to unauthorized remote access to internal systems. This was identified from the 'Network Scan Data' showing port 22 as open.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Network perimeter</li><li>SSH server</li><li>Internal systems accessible via SSH</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins. This will add a critical layer of security against credential compromise. Concurrently, a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) must be developed, clearly communicated to all staff, and consistently enforced to establish guidelines for technology usage and mitigate human-factor risks. For the identified open SSH port (22), immediate action should be taken to secure it by disabling password authentication in favor of SSH key-based authentication, implementing strict firewall rules to restrict access to only trusted IP addresses, enabling rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks, and ensuring the SSH server software is regularly patched and monitored for suspicious activity. Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments should also be conducted to proactively identify and address any emerging threats.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization has established a good foundation by implementing MFA for sensitive systems and conducting regular security awareness training. However, critical vulnerabilities remain, particularly the absence of MFA for computer logins and a formal acceptable use policy, which expose the organization to significant risks of unauthorized access and misuse of resources. The open SSH port also presents a potential entry point that requires immediate attention. Addressing these key areas will substantially improve the organization's overall security posture, reduce its attack surface, and enhance its readiness against prevalent cyber threats.</p>
