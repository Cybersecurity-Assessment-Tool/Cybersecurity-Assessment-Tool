        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes an Nginx web server (version 1.18.0) on port 443, indicating a public-facing web presence. Internally, the organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and access to sensitive data systems, which is a positive security measure. However, critical gaps exist in email security, employee policy enforcement, and ongoing security education. Specifically, MFA is not required for email access, there is no formal employee acceptable use policy, and annual security awareness training for all employees is not conducted.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Email accounts are a primary target for phishing, credential stuffing, and business email compromise (BEC) attacks. Without Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access, a compromised password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's email, potentially leading to data exfiltration, impersonation, and further internal network penetration. This vulnerability was identified by the organization's self-reported data indicating no MFA requirement for email.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee email accounts</li><li>Email server/service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) is crucial for defining the proper and expected use of organizational assets, networks, and data by employees. The absence of such a policy creates a lack of clear guidelines, increasing the risk of misuse of company resources, accidental data breaches, and potential non-compliance with regulatory requirements. This vulnerability was identified by the organization's self-reported data indicating no employee acceptable use policy.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Infrequent Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the lack of annual training for all employees means that security knowledge can degrade over time, new threat vectors are not consistently communicated, and best practices may not be reinforced. This significantly increases the organization's susceptibility to social engineering, phishing, and other human-factor attacks, which remain a leading cause of security incidents. This vulnerability was identified by the organization's self-reported data indicating no annual security awareness training for all employees.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network security</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access to significantly reduce the risk of email account compromise. Concurrently, a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) should be developed, communicated, and enforced across the entire organization to establish clear guidelines for resource usage and data handling. Furthermore, a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees must be established and regularly conducted to ensure that staff are continuously educated on current threats, best practices, and their role in maintaining the organization's security posture. Regular patching and monitoring of the Nginx web server (version 1.18.0) should also be maintained to address any potential vulnerabilities in the web infrastructure.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems. However, significant vulnerabilities exist in critical areas such as email security, employee policy, and ongoing security education. Addressing the lack of MFA for email, establishing an AUP, and implementing annual security awareness training are crucial steps to enhance the overall security posture and readiness against common cyber threats. Without these measures, the organization remains at elevated risk of human-factor attacks and internal policy violations.</p>
