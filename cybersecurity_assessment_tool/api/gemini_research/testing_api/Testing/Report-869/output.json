            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network scan revealed an open RDP port (3389), indicating potential exposure to remote access threats. From an organizational standpoint, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enforced for email and computer logins, and an acceptable use policy is in place. New employees receive security awareness training. However, MFA is not required for accessing sensitive data systems, and annual security awareness training for all employees is not conducted, leaving gaps in the security posture.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "RDP Exposure",
                        "Overview": "Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed, meaning it is accessible from outside the internal network. This allows potential attackers to attempt brute-force attacks or exploit vulnerabilities in the RDP service to gain unauthorized access to internal systems. This was identified through an Nmap scan showing port 3389 open.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "IP"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified RDP exposure, it is strongly recommended to immediately close port 3389 to external access. For legitimate remote access needs, implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution to provide a secure, encrypted tunnel. Furthermore, the organization should implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to add an essential layer of security. Regular, at least annual, security awareness training for all employees is also crucial to maintain a strong human firewall against evolving threats.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces a critical vulnerability due to an exposed RDP service, which significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access. While some foundational security practices like MFA for email and computer logins, and initial employee training are in place, the lack of MFA for sensitive data systems and infrequent security awareness training for existing employees represent notable gaps in the overall security posture. Addressing these areas is vital for enhancing the organization's readiness against cyber threats."
