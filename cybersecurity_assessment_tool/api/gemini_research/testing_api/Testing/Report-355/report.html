        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security awareness training and acceptable use policies. However, critical gaps exist in authentication practices, particularly concerning Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and sensitive data systems. A network scan also revealed an exposed SSH service, indicating potential attack surface exposure. While MFA is utilized for email access, its absence in other critical areas significantly elevates the overall risk posture.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Weak Authentication for Computer Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for employees to log into their computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication. An attacker who obtains a user's password could gain full access to their workstation and potentially pivot further into the network. This was identified from the 'Org Data' indicating 'No' for MFA to log into computers.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network endpoints</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Weak Authentication for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk, as compromised credentials could grant direct access to confidential information, leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and severe reputational damage. The lack of an additional authentication factor makes these systems highly vulnerable to credential stuffing, phishing, or brute-force attacks. This was identified from the 'Org Data' indicating 'No' for MFA to access sensitive data systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>File shares</li><li>Cloud storage platforms</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed SSH Service - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A network scan revealed that port 22 (SSH) is open on at least one host. While SSH is a legitimate service for secure remote administration, its exposure to the internet or internal network without proper hardening (e.g., strong authentication, rate limiting, disabling password authentication, IP whitelisting) can be exploited by attackers. This service can be targeted for brute-force attacks or to exploit known vulnerabilities in the SSH daemon to gain unauthorized access. This was identified from the 'Network Scan Data' showing an open port 22.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host(s) with open port 22</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points. Specifically, MFA should be mandated for all employee computer logins and for accessing any system containing sensitive data. For the exposed SSH service, a comprehensive review of its configuration is necessary. This includes ensuring strong, key-based authentication is enforced, password authentication is disabled, rate limiting is applied, and access is restricted to only necessary IP addresses or networks. Furthermore, regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing should be conducted to identify and address any new or emerging threats.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has a good foundation in security awareness and acceptable use policies, its current readiness is significantly hampered by critical authentication weaknesses. The absence of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, coupled with an exposed SSH service, creates substantial attack vectors that could lead to unauthorized access and data breaches. Addressing these vulnerabilities, particularly through the widespread implementation of MFA and hardening of exposed services, is paramount to improving the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and reducing its risk profile.</p>
