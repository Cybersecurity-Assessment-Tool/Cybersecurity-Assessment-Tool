                "Summary": "The organization's network currently presents several critical vulnerabilities. An open Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) port (3389) was identified, exposing a critical service to the internet. Furthermore, the organization lacks fundamental security practices, including the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and computer logins, although MFA is utilized for sensitive data systems. There is also a complete lack of security awareness training for both new and existing employees, and no employee acceptable use policy is in place. These deficiencies collectively indicate a low security readiness level and a high susceptibility to various cyber threats.",

                        "Risk": "RDP Exposure",
                        "Overview": "Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed externally on port 3389. This allows potential attackers to attempt brute-force attacks or exploit known vulnerabilities in the RDP service to gain unauthorized access to internal systems. This was identified via a network scan showing port 3389 as open.",

                        "Risk": "Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access or computer logins. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks, as a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access. This was identified through organizational policy review.",

                        "Risk": "Absence of Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or annually for all employees. This leaves employees vulnerable to social engineering tactics (e.g., phishing, pretexting) and unaware of best practices for data handling and secure computing, increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents. This was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "High",

                    {
                        "Risk": "No Employee Acceptable Use Policy",
                        "Overview": "The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines, employees may engage in activities that inadvertently introduce security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or misusing company resources. This was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Employee workstations",
                            "Network resources",
                            "Organizational data"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, immediate action is required. For the RDP exposure, it is critical to close port 3389 externally. A more secure long-term solution involves implementing a Virtual Private Network (VPN) for remote access, ensuring that RDP is only accessible through a secure, authenticated tunnel. Furthermore, the organization must implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and computer logins to significantly enhance credential security. Comprehensive security awareness training should be initiated for all new hires and conducted annually for all employees to educate them on common threats and secure practices. Finally, an employee acceptable use policy should be developed and enforced to establish clear guidelines for technology usage and minimize human-related security risks.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks due to an exposed RDP service and a lack of fundamental security controls and policies. The absence of MFA for critical access points, coupled with no security awareness training and an acceptable use policy, creates a highly vulnerable environment. While MFA is used for sensitive data systems, the overall readiness is low, leaving the organization susceptible to various cyberattacks, including unauthorized access, data breaches, and social engineering. Addressing these vulnerabilities promptly is crucial to improve the organization's security posture."
