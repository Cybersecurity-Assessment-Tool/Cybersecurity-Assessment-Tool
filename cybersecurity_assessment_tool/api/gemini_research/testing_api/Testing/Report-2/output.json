            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization demonstrates a commitment to security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, and conducts regular security awareness training for all employees. However, a critical gap exists with the absence of an employee acceptable use policy. Network scans revealed an active FTP server running vsftpd 2.3.4, which permits anonymous access, posing a significant data exposure risk. Furthermore, several workstations are still operating on the outdated Windows 7 operating system, presenting known security vulnerabilities.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Outdated Operating System (Windows 7)",
                        "Overview": "Computers are running Windows 7, which is an end-of-life operating system no longer receiving security updates from Microsoft. This exposes the workstations to known and unpatched vulnerabilities, making them susceptible to various cyberattacks, including malware, ransomware, and data breaches.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Workstations"
                        ]

                    {
                        "Risk": "Anonymous FTP Login Allowed",
                        "Overview": "The FTP server (vsftpd 2.3.4) is configured to allow anonymous login. This means unauthorized users can access the server without credentials, potentially allowing them to view, upload, or download files, leading to data leakage, unauthorized data injection, or server compromise. The specific version vsftpd 2.3.4 is also known to have vulnerabilities.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "FTP Server (vsftpd 2.3.4)",
                            "Port 21"

                    {
                        "Risk": "Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy",
                        "Overview": "The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This absence means there are no formal guidelines or rules for employees regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, data, and internet access. This can lead to increased risks of data breaches, malware infections, legal liabilities, and productivity loss due to misuse or negligence.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All Employees",
                            "IT Resources",
                            "Data Systems"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately disable anonymous access on the FTP server and, if FTP services are still required, transition to secure protocols like SFTP or FTPS with robust authentication. Furthermore, the vsftpd server should be updated to a currently supported version or replaced with a more secure file transfer solution. All workstations running Windows 7 must be upgraded to a supported operating system, such as Windows 10 or 11, to ensure they receive critical security updates. For systems unable to support newer OS versions, a hardware refresh should be considered. Finally, the organization must develop and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy, ensuring all employees are trained on its contents and formally acknowledge their understanding and compliance. The existing practices of Multi-Factor Authentication and regular security awareness training should be continued and reinforced.",
            "Conclusion": "While the organization has established a strong foundation with Multi-Factor Authentication and consistent security awareness training, significant vulnerabilities remain. The presence of an outdated operating system (Windows 7) on workstations and an anonymously accessible FTP server poses immediate and critical technical risks. Coupled with the absence of a formal acceptable use policy, these issues indicate a need for urgent remediation in both technical infrastructure and organizational policy to enhance the overall cybersecurity posture and readiness against potential threats."
