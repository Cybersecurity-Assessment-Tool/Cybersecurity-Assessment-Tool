        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, and conducting regular security awareness training for all employees. However, critical gaps exist, notably the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems and a formal employee acceptable use policy. A network scan also revealed an open SSH port (22), which, while potentially legitimate, represents an exposed attack surface that requires careful review and securing.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if primary credentials are compromised (e.g., via phishing, keylogging, or brute-force attacks). Without MFA, a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to sensitive data, leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and reputational damage. This was identified directly from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an established Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). An AUP defines the proper and acceptable use of organizational IT resources, including networks, systems, software, and data. Without such a policy, employees may unknowingly engage in activities that pose security risks (e.g., installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, mishandling sensitive information), leading to malware infections, data leakage, and legal liabilities. This was identified directly from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational IT resources</li><li>Network infrastructure</li><li>Data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port (Port 22) Exposed - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The network scan identified an open SSH (Secure Shell) port (port 22) on one or more hosts. While SSH is a legitimate and secure protocol for remote administration, an open port represents an attack surface. If not properly secured with strong authentication (e.g., key-based authentication, disabled password login), rate limiting, and IP restrictions, it can be vulnerable to brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or exploitation of SSH daemon vulnerabilities, potentially leading to unauthorized remote access to the system. This was identified via the Nmap scan data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host(s) with open port 22</li><li>Network perimeter</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access even if primary credentials are compromised. Concurrently, develop and enforce a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) to clearly define proper IT resource usage, educate employees on their responsibilities, and reduce human-factor risks. Furthermore, conduct a thorough review of the host(s) with the open SSH port (22) to ensure it is configured with robust security measures, including strong authentication (preferably key-based), IP whitelisting, and rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks. Regularly review and update security policies and configurations.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has made commendable strides in implementing MFA for email and computer logins and maintaining regular security awareness training, significant vulnerabilities remain. The absence of MFA for sensitive data systems and a formal acceptable use policy creates critical control gaps that could lead to data breaches and operational disruptions. The exposed SSH port also presents a potential entry point for attackers. Addressing these areas is paramount to enhancing the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and readiness against evolving threats.</p>
