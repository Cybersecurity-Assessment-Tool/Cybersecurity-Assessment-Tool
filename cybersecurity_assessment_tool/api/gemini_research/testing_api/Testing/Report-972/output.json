            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization demonstrates some foundational security practices, such as requiring MFA for computer logins and providing security awareness training for new employees, along with having an acceptable use policy. However, critical gaps exist in the application of Multi-Factor Authentication for email and sensitive data systems, and the frequency of security awareness training for all employees is insufficient. The provided network scan data and current vulnerabilities were broken, so this assessment focuses on the organizational policy and practice data.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts, even if passwords are stolen or compromised. Email accounts often contain sensitive information and can be used for phishing attacks or to reset passwords for other services. This was identified through the organizational data provided.",

                        "Risk": "Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if a single factor (e.g., password) is compromised. Attackers could gain direct access to sensitive information, leading to data breaches, regulatory fines, and reputational damage. This was identified through the organizational data provided.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Infrequent Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. While new employees receive training, the lack of regular, recurring training means that employees may not be kept up-to-date on the latest threats, best practices, and organizational policies. This increases the risk of human error leading to security incidents, such as falling for phishing scams, mishandling sensitive data, or using weak passwords. This was identified through the organizational data provided.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "Organizational security posture"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "It is strongly recommended that the organization implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access to significantly reduce the risk of account compromise. Furthermore, MFA should be immediately deployed for all sensitive data systems to protect critical information from unauthorized access. The organization should also establish and enforce a policy for mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees to ensure ongoing education on current threats and best practices, reinforcing the initial training provided to new hires. Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments should be conducted to identify and address technical vulnerabilities not covered in this policy-focused assessment.",
            "Conclusion": "Based on the available organizational data, the organization exhibits a mixed security posture. While some essential controls are in place, the absence of MFA for email and sensitive data systems, coupled with infrequent security awareness training for the entire workforce, represents significant and critical vulnerabilities. Addressing these policy and practice gaps is paramount to enhancing the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and reducing its exposure to common attack vectors."
