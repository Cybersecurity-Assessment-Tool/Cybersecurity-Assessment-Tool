        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes a MySQL database on port 3306, indicating a potential direct attack surface. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for computer logins and sensitive data systems, a critical gap exists as MFA is not required for email access. Furthermore, the organization lacks fundamental security practices, including an employee acceptable use policy and regular security awareness training for both new and existing employees, which significantly increases human-factor vulnerabilities.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network. This exposes the database to potential unauthorized access, data breaches, and denial-of-service attacks if not properly secured. It was identified via an Nmap scan showing port 3306 as open.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing or credential stuffing attacks, as a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to an employee's email, which is often a gateway to other systems and sensitive information.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without a clear AUP, employees may not understand their responsibilities regarding company IT resources, leading to misuse, increased risk of malware infections, data leakage, and potential non-compliance with industry regulations.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Organizational IT resources</li><li>Employee behavior</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training. This means new hires may not be aware of common cyber threats (e.g., phishing, social engineering), company security policies, or best practices, making them vulnerable targets and potential entry points for attackers.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. Without regular training, employees' knowledge of evolving cyber threats and security best practices can become outdated, increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents and successful social engineering attacks.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306 to only authorized IP addresses or internal networks; for long-term security, consider placing the database behind a VPN or using a secure tunnel for remote access. Furthermore, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be implemented and enforced for all email accounts to prevent unauthorized access. The organization should develop and implement a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) that clearly outlines expectations for IT resource usage, data handling, and security responsibilities, ensuring all employees acknowledge and understand the policy. Finally, establish mandatory security awareness training for all new employees during their onboarding process and implement annual security awareness training for all employees to keep them updated on current threats and best practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization faces significant security risks primarily due to an exposed database service and critical gaps in foundational security practices. The absence of MFA for email, a formal acceptable use policy, and regular security awareness training creates multiple avenues for potential breaches and human-factor vulnerabilities. Addressing these issues is crucial for improving the overall security posture and readiness against evolving cyber threats, moving towards a more resilient and secure operational environment.</p>
