            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's current security posture, based on the provided data, reveals critical vulnerabilities primarily in identity and access management and ongoing security awareness. While an acceptable use policy is in place and new employees receive initial security training, the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, combined with a lack of annual security awareness training for all employees, creates significant exposure to common cyber threats. The provided network scan data and current vulnerabilities list were incomplete, limiting a deeper technical assessment, but the policy-level deficiencies are evident.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Inadequate Email Account Protection",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. Compromised email accounts can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and further internal network penetration. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on email access.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Email accounts",
                            "Email server/service",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Inadequate Workstation Login Protection",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This leaves employee workstations vulnerable to unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or guessed. A compromised workstation can provide an attacker with access to internal networks, sensitive data, and the ability to deploy malware. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on computer logins.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Employee workstations",
                            "Network access points",

                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Inconsistent Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. While new employees receive initial training, the lack of regular, recurring training for all staff means that employees may not be up-to-date on the latest threats, best practices, and organizational policies. This increases the risk of human error leading to security incidents, such as falling for phishing scams, mishandling sensitive data, or using weak passwords. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for annual security awareness training for all employees.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "Organizational security posture",
                            "Data handling practices"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and computer logins. This will significantly enhance credential security and prevent unauthorized access. Furthermore, establish and enforce a policy for annual, mandatory security awareness training for all employees, ensuring they are regularly updated on current threats, best practices, and organizational security protocols. Review and update existing acceptable use policies to reflect these new security requirements and consider conducting regular phishing simulations to test employee vigilance.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces significant risks due to critical gaps in its identity and access management, specifically the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for email and computer logins. This, combined with an inconsistent approach to ongoing security awareness training for its entire workforce, leaves the organization vulnerable to common attack vectors such as phishing, credential theft, and human error. While some foundational security elements exist, addressing these policy and training deficiencies is paramount for improving the overall cybersecurity readiness and significantly reducing the likelihood of successful cyberattacks."
