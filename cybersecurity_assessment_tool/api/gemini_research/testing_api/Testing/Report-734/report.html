        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization currently employs Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems, and has established an acceptable use policy along with regular security awareness training for all employees. However, MFA is not enforced for computer logins. A network scan revealed an active FTP server running vsftpd 2.3.4, which is configured to allow anonymous access, posing a significant data exposure risk. Additionally, several workstations are still operating on end-of-life Windows 7.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Anonymous FTP Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An FTP server (vsftpd 2.3.4) is running on port 21 and allows anonymous login. This configuration can lead to unauthorized access to files, data leakage, or even unauthorized file uploads, depending on the server's configuration. The service version (2.3.4) is also quite old and may have known vulnerabilities.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>FTP Server (vsftpd 2.3.4)</li><li>Port 21</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No MFA for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee workstations</li><li>Login systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Windows Policy - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Computers are running Windows 7. Windows 7 has reached its end-of-life, meaning it no longer receives security updates from Microsoft. This leaves systems vulnerable to newly discovered exploits and malware, significantly increasing the risk of compromise.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>It is strongly recommended to immediately disable anonymous FTP access on the identified server and ensure all FTP services are properly secured with robust authentication and access controls. Furthermore, the organization should prioritize the implementation and enforcement of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to enhance endpoint security. All workstations currently running Windows 7 must be upgraded to a supported operating system (e.g., Windows 10 or 11) to mitigate risks associated with end-of-life software. A comprehensive plan for hardware refresh should also be developed to support these upgrades. Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments should be conducted to maintain a strong security posture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security through MFA for critical systems and employee training. However, significant vulnerabilities exist, including an anonymously accessible and outdated FTP server, the absence of MFA for computer logins, and the continued use of end-of-life Windows 7 operating systems on workstations. Addressing these high-severity risks is crucial to prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and maintain overall cybersecurity readiness.</p>
