        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network posture, based on provided organizational data, indicates significant weaknesses in foundational security controls. While no technical network scan vulnerabilities were provided, the absence of multi-factor authentication (MFA) across critical access points and the lack of essential security policies expose the organization to a high level of risk. The organization conducts security awareness training for new employees but lacks annual recurring training for all staff, further increasing human-factor related risks.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts through credential theft (e.g., phishing, brute-force attacks). Compromised email accounts can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and further internal network penetration. This was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email accounts</li><li>Email servers</li><li>User credentials</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for logging into computers within the organization. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are stolen or guessed. An attacker gaining access to a computer can potentially move laterally within the network, access sensitive data, or deploy malware. This was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations</li><li>Servers</li><li>User accounts</li><li>Network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Access to sensitive data systems does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). This is a critical vulnerability as it means that a single compromised credential could grant an attacker access to the organization's most valuable and sensitive information. The impact could include severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and significant reputational damage. This was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>File shares</li><li>Cloud storage</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy (AUP). Without a formal AUP, employees may be unaware of their responsibilities regarding the use of company IT resources, leading to misuse, unauthorized activities, or actions that inadvertently introduce security risks (e.g., installing unapproved software, visiting malicious websites). This absence creates ambiguity and hinders enforcement of security best practices. This was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>IT systems</li><li>Network resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Recurring Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This means that employees may not be kept up-to-date on the latest threats, best practices, and organizational policies, leading to a degradation of security posture over time. A lack of regular training increases the likelihood of successful phishing attacks, social engineering, and other human-factor related incidents. This was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security culture</li><li>Incident response capabilities</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, including email, computer logins, and especially sensitive data systems, as a top priority. Developing and enforcing a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy (AUP) is crucial to establish clear guidelines for IT resource usage and mitigate internal risks. Furthermore, establishing a program for mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees is essential to ensure ongoing vigilance against evolving cyber threats and reinforce secure behaviors.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces a high level of risk primarily due to the absence of fundamental security controls such as Multi-Factor Authentication for critical systems and the lack of essential security policies. While initial security awareness training is provided, the absence of recurring training further exacerbates human-related vulnerabilities. Addressing these foundational weaknesses is paramount to improving the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and protecting against potential breaches and data loss.</p>
