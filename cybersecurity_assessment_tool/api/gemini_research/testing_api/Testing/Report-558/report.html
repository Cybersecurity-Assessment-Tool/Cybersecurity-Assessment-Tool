        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization exhibits a commendable commitment to cybersecurity readiness, evidenced by the mandatory implementation of multi-factor authentication (MFA) for critical access points including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, a robust employee acceptable use policy is in place, complemented by regular security awareness training for both new and existing employees. While network scans indicated port 80 as closed, a specific vulnerability assessment identified an unencrypted web server, suggesting a potential exposure that warrants immediate attention.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unencrypted Web Server - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An unencrypted web server was identified, with port 80 reported as open. This configuration allows for unencrypted HTTP traffic, making any data transmitted over this port susceptible to interception, eavesdropping, and potential manipulation by malicious actors. The presence of this vulnerability was identified during a security assessment.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To address the identified unencrypted web server vulnerability, it is strongly recommended to take immediate action. The most straightforward mitigation is to close port 80 if the service is not essential or can be migrated. For services requiring web access, a comprehensive long-term solution involves implementing SSL/TLS encryption across all web servers. This will ensure that all data transmitted is encrypted, safeguarding sensitive information from interception and enhancing data integrity and confidentiality.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In conclusion, the organization has established a strong foundation for cybersecurity readiness through its diligent application of MFA across critical systems and its proactive approach to employee security awareness training. Despite these strengths, the identified unencrypted web server, accessible via port 80, presents a significant vulnerability that could compromise data confidentiality. Prompt remediation of this specific risk is essential to fortify the organization's security posture and maintain its overall resilience against cyber threats.</p>
