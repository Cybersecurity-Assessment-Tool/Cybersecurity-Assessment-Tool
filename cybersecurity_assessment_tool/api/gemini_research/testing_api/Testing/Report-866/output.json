            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network includes an FTP server running vsftpd 2.3.4. Internally, workstations are running Windows 7. The organization has implemented MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems but not for email access. Security awareness training is provided for new employees but not annually for all staff. There is no formal employee acceptable use policy in place.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Anonymous FTP Login Allowed",
                        "Overview": "The FTP server (vsftpd 2.3.4) allows anonymous login, which can lead to unauthorized access to files, data leakage, or even server compromise if write permissions are misconfigured. This vulnerability was identified via the Nmap script 'ftp-anon'.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "FTP Server (vsftpd 2.3.4 on port 21)"
                        ]

                    {
                        "Risk": "No MFA for Email Access",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing or brute-force attacks, as a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to an employee's email, potentially leading to data breaches or further internal network access.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Email System",

                    {
                        "Risk": "No Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)",
                        "Overview": "The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This means there are no formal guidelines for employees regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, data handling, and internet usage, increasing the risk of misuse, data breaches, and non-compliance with security standards.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All Employees",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Infrequent Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "While new employees receive security awareness training, all employees do not receive it at least once per year. This leads to outdated knowledge regarding current threats, phishing techniques, and best security practices, increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Outdated Windows Policy",
                        "Overview": "Computers are running Windows 7, an operating system that has reached its end-of-life and no longer receives security updates from Microsoft. This leaves systems vulnerable to known exploits and new threats, significantly increasing the risk of compromise and making compliance difficult.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Workstations"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is recommended to immediately disable anonymous FTP access on the vsftpd server and consider upgrading to a supported version. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access to enhance account security. Develop and enforce a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) to guide employee behavior regarding IT resource usage. Establish a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees to ensure up-to-date knowledge of cyber threats. Most critically, prioritize upgrading all workstations running Windows 7 to a currently supported operating system (e.g., Windows 10 or 11) to ensure they receive essential security updates and patches.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization faces several significant security risks, including an anonymously accessible FTP server, widespread use of an end-of-life operating system (Windows 7), and a lack of MFA for email access. Furthermore, the absence of an acceptable use policy and infrequent security awareness training for all employees indicate gaps in foundational security practices. Addressing these vulnerabilities is crucial to improve the organization's overall security posture and readiness against cyber threats."
