        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The network scan data indicates a minimal external footprint with port 80 reported as closed. However, a review of organizational policies reveals significant internal security weaknesses. The organization currently requires MFA for email access but lacks it for computer logins and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, there is no established employee acceptable use policy, and critical security awareness training for both new and existing employees is absent. These policy and training gaps represent substantial risks to the organization's overall security posture.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for employees to log into their computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised, as a single factor (password) is insufficient to protect against modern attack techniques. Identified via organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network endpoints</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access systems containing sensitive data. This leaves critical information vulnerable to unauthorized access through compromised credentials, potentially leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and reputational damage. Identified via organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>File shares</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy (AUP). Without an AUP, employees may be unaware of their responsibilities regarding the use of company IT resources, leading to misuse, increased risk of malware infections, data leakage, and legal liabilities. Identified via organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>IT systems</li><li>Network resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No New Employee Security Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training. This means new hires may not be equipped with the knowledge to identify and avoid common cyber threats like phishing, social engineering, or proper data handling, making them potential entry points for attacks. Identified via organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Email systems</li><li>Internal applications</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Annual Security Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. Regular training is crucial to keep employees updated on evolving threats and reinforce best practices, preventing complacency and ensuring a strong human firewall. Lack of recurrent training increases susceptibility to sophisticated attacks. Identified via organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational culture</li><li>Overall security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and access to sensitive data systems. Developing and enforcing a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy is crucial to define expected behavior and responsibilities regarding IT resource usage. Additionally, establishing mandatory security awareness training programs for all new employees and conducting annual refresher training for all staff will significantly enhance the human firewall against social engineering and other cyber threats. Regular policy reviews and updates are also advised to ensure ongoing alignment with best security practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In conclusion, while the external network footprint appears limited, the organization faces significant internal security vulnerabilities primarily stemming from a lack of robust security policies and employee training. The absence of MFA for critical systems, an acceptable use policy, and comprehensive security awareness training leaves the organization highly susceptible to credential compromise, insider threats, and social engineering attacks. Addressing these foundational weaknesses is paramount to improving the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and reducing its risk exposure.</p>
