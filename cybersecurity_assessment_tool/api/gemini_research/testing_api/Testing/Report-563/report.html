        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan data indicates an open SSH port (22) on an unspecified host. While an acceptable use policy and regular security awareness training are in place, critical gaps exist in multi-factor authentication (MFA) implementation. Specifically, MFA is not required for accessing email or sensitive data systems, significantly increasing the risk of unauthorized access through compromised credentials. An additional critical vulnerability related to a 'Localhost Exposed' service has also been identified.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A critical vulnerability has been identified where a service intended for internal access or localhost is potentially exposed to the network, indicating a misconfiguration or an unintended network accessibility. This could allow unauthorized access to internal services or data if exploited. The exact nature of the exposure requires further investigation.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Internal Network IP</li><li>Specific Service (requires further investigation)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Weak Email Authentication - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing, as a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to an employee's email.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email System</li><li>All Employee Email Accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Weak Sensitive Data System Authentication - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not enforced for logging into systems containing sensitive data. This poses a critical risk, as compromised credentials could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and regulatory non-compliance.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive Data Systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>File Servers</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH port (22) was detected on a host. While SSH is a legitimate service, an open port without proper hardening (e.g., strong authentication, disabling password authentication, IP restrictions, regular patching) can be a target for brute-force attacks or exploitation of known vulnerabilities in the SSH server software.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with Port 22 Open</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediately deploy and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and access to sensitive data systems. This is the most critical step to mitigate credential-based attacks. Conduct an immediate investigation to identify the service exposed as 'Localhost Exposed' and determine its actual network accessibility, implementing appropriate network segmentation, firewall rules, or service binding configurations to restrict access. For the open SSH port, ensure robust security configurations are in place, including disabling password authentication in favor of key-based authentication, implementing strong passphrase policies for keys, restricting SSH access to specific trusted IP addresses, and ensuring the SSH server software is regularly patched and up-to-date. Consider implementing a jump host or VPN for SSH access. Furthermore, implement regular, automated vulnerability scanning across the entire network to proactively identify and address open ports, misconfigurations, and known vulnerabilities. Periodically review and audit access controls for all systems, especially those containing sensitive data, to ensure the principle of least privilege is consistently applied.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security through its acceptable use policy and consistent security awareness training. However, significant vulnerabilities exist, primarily due to the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for email and sensitive data systems, which represents a critical risk for credential compromise and data breaches. The presence of an open SSH port and an identified 'Localhost Exposed' issue further highlight areas requiring immediate technical remediation. Addressing these critical gaps by implementing MFA, investigating and securing exposed services, and hardening network configurations is paramount to improving the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and readiness against sophisticated threats.</p>
