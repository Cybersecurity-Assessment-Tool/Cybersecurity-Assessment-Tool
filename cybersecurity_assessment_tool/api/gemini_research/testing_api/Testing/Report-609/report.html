        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open port 8080 exposing a system titled "TOP SECRET DB", indicating a critical security flaw. Furthermore, the organization's security posture is significantly weakened by the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems, despite requiring it for computer logins. There is also no formal employee acceptable use policy in place. While security awareness training is conducted for new employees and annually for all employees, these fundamental gaps in access control and policy create significant attack vectors that could lead to unauthorized access and data breaches.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed Sensitive Database - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An Nmap scan identified an open port 8080 with the title "TOP SECRET DB". This indicates that a database or application containing highly sensitive information is directly accessible from the network, potentially without adequate authentication or encryption. The exposure of such a system poses a critical risk of data breach, unauthorized access, and compromise of confidential information.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li><li>TOP SECRET DB application/database</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of email account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. A compromised email account can lead to business email compromise (BEC) scams, data exfiltration, and further lateral movement within the network.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee email accounts</li><li>Email system</li></ul>

                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This leaves critical systems vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are stolen or guessed. The impact of a breach in these systems could include severe data loss, regulatory non-compliance, financial penalties, and reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy (AUP). Without a formal AUP, employees may be unaware of their responsibilities regarding the use of company IT resources, data handling, and internet usage. This increases the risk of accidental data breaches, malware infections, and intentional misuse of company assets, making it difficult to enforce security standards and hold employees accountable.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>IT systems</li><li>Data handling procedures</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Port 8080 Secured (False Positive) - <span class="severity-Info">Info</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A previous assessment indicated that Port 8080 was confirmed secure and a false positive. This information is noted, but it directly conflicts with current scan data showing an open port with sensitive information. This entry is included as per the provided 'Current Risks' but should be re-evaluated in light of new findings.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediate action is required to secure the system exposed on port 8080, including implementing strong authentication, encryption, and restricting network access. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be implemented for all email accounts and sensitive data systems to significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access. The organization should also develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to clearly define expected behavior and responsibilities regarding IT resource usage and data handling. Regular security audits and penetration testing should be conducted to identify and remediate emerging vulnerabilities.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several critical and high-severity vulnerabilities, primarily stemming from exposed sensitive systems and a lack of robust access controls like MFA for key services. The absence of an acceptable use policy further exacerbates these risks by potentially leading to internal security incidents. While security awareness training is a positive step, the identified technical and policy gaps indicate a significant level of readiness deficiency that requires urgent attention to prevent potential data breaches and system compromises.</p>
