        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates strong multi-factor authentication (MFA) implementation across email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, which is a significant security strength. However, critical gaps exist in foundational security policies and ongoing employee training. A network scan identified an open port 8080 with a 'TOP SECRET DB' title, which was subsequently confirmed as secured and a false positive for an actual vulnerability, indicating a potentially well-secured specific service.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. This absence means there are no clear guidelines for employees regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, data, and internet access. This can lead to misuse, increased risk of data breaches, and legal liabilities, as employees may unknowingly engage in activities that compromise security. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>IT systems</li><li>Sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This oversight leaves the workforce susceptible to evolving cyber threats such as phishing, social engineering, and malware, as their knowledge and vigilance may degrade over time. Regular, recurring training is crucial to maintain a strong human firewall. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization develop and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy. This policy should clearly outline expectations for IT resource usage, data handling, and internet conduct, ensuring all employees acknowledge and understand its terms. Furthermore, establish a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees, covering current threat landscapes, best practices for data protection, phishing recognition, and incident reporting procedures. Continue to enforce strong MFA policies across all critical systems. Regularly review and update security configurations, even for services initially deemed secure, to ensure ongoing protection against emerging threats.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization has a commendable stance on multi-factor authentication, which significantly enhances access security across various critical systems. However, the absence of a formal acceptable use policy and the lack of recurring annual security awareness training for all employees represent critical vulnerabilities. These gaps expose the organization to human-centric risks, potential policy violations, and a reduced ability to defend against evolving cyber threats. Addressing these policy and training deficiencies is paramount to building a robust and resilient cybersecurity posture.</p>
