                "Summary": "The network scan identified an open SSH port (22), indicating remote access capabilities. Organizational data reveals that while Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is used for email and sensitive data systems, it is not enforced for computer logins. Furthermore, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or annually for all staff.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Computer Logins",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication. This was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employee computers",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)",
                        "Overview": "The organization currently lacks a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy. Without an AUP, employees may be unaware of their responsibilities regarding the use of company IT resources, leading to potential misuse, data breaches, or non-compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. This was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Insufficient Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or on an annual basis for all staff. This leaves employees vulnerable to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) and unaware of best practices for data protection, password hygiene, and incident reporting, significantly increasing the risk of human error leading to security incidents. This was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "Organizational data",
                            "Network security"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to enhance authentication security. A comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy should be developed and enforced to clearly define acceptable behavior and responsibilities for IT resource usage. Furthermore, a robust security awareness training program must be established, including mandatory training for all new hires and annual refresher training for all employees, to educate staff on current threats and best security practices.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently exhibits several critical gaps in its security posture, primarily stemming from a lack of foundational security policies and training. While some MFA is in place, the absence of MFA for computer logins, an acceptable use policy, and regular security awareness training exposes the organization to significant risks from unauthorized access and human error. Addressing these areas is crucial for improving overall cybersecurity readiness and reducing the likelihood of successful attacks."
