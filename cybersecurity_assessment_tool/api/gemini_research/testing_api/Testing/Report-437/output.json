            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization has implemented multi-factor authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, and conducts regular security awareness training for all employees, including new hires. An acceptable use policy is also in place. However, MFA is not required for accessing sensitive data systems. A network scan identified an open Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) port (3389) on a host, indicating a potential external exposure.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "RDP Exposure",
                        "Overview": "Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed to the internet via an open port (3389). This allows external entities to attempt to connect to internal systems, significantly increasing the risk of brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, and unauthorized access if weak credentials or unpatched vulnerabilities exist. This vulnerability was identified through a network port scan.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "IP"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "Immediate action should be taken to mitigate the RDP exposure. The easiest fix is to close port 3389 to external access. For long-term security, RDP access should be restricted to internal networks or secured via a Virtual Private Network (VPN) for remote access, ensuring multi-factor authentication is enforced for VPN connections. Additionally, it is strongly recommended to implement multi-factor authentication for accessing sensitive data systems to enhance protection against unauthorized access, aligning with the organization's existing MFA practices for email and computer logins.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization demonstrates a good foundation in security awareness and policy implementation, with MFA in place for email and computer logins. However, a critical vulnerability exists with an exposed RDP port, posing a significant risk of unauthorized access. Furthermore, the lack of MFA for sensitive data systems represents a gap in access control that should be addressed to strengthen the overall security posture and readiness against sophisticated threats."
