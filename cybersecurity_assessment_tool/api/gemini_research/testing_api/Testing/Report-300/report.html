        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security awareness and policy, evidenced by its established acceptable use policy and consistent security awareness training for both new and existing employees. However, a critical gap exists in its access control mechanisms, specifically the absence of multi-factor authentication (MFA) for email access and computer logins. While MFA is implemented for sensitive data systems, its lack in these common access points significantly elevates the risk of unauthorized access and account compromise, despite the positive aspects of its security training and policy framework. This assessment is based solely on the provided organizational policy data, as network scan and current vulnerability data were unavailable.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Multi-Factor Authentication for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. If an attacker gains access to an employee's email, they could potentially reset passwords for other services, access sensitive communications, or launch further internal phishing attacks, leading to data breaches or financial loss. This was identified through the organizational policy data indicating "Do you require MFA to access email?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee email accounts</li><li>Email server infrastructure</li><li>Sensitive communications</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Multi-Factor Authentication for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials (username and password) are compromised. An attacker gaining access to a computer could then access internal networks, sensitive files, or deploy malware, leading to significant operational disruption, data exfiltration, or system compromise. This was identified through the organizational policy data indicating "Do you require MFA to log into computers?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee workstations and laptops</li><li>Internal network access points</li><li>Sensitive data stored locally</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points. Specifically, MFA should be mandated for all employee email accounts to protect against credential compromise and phishing attacks. Furthermore, MFA must be enforced for all computer logins to secure endpoints and prevent unauthorized access to internal systems. While the current security awareness training and acceptable use policies are positive, these technical controls are essential to mitigate the high risks associated with single-factor authentication. Regular audits of MFA implementation and user adoption should also be conducted to ensure ongoing effectiveness.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Based on the provided organizational data, the organization exhibits a commendable commitment to security awareness training and policy development. However, its overall readiness is significantly hampered by critical vulnerabilities stemming from the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for email access and computer logins. While MFA is correctly applied to sensitive data systems, the lack of it in these common access vectors creates substantial entry points for attackers. Addressing these MFA gaps is paramount to elevating the organization's security posture, reducing the risk of unauthorized access, and safeguarding its digital assets against prevalent cyber threats.</p>
