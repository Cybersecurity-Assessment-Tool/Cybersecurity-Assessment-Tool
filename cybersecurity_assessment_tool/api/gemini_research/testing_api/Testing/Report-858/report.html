        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network shows at least one active host. Security practices indicate strong MFA adoption for email and sensitive data systems, but a gap exists for computer login. An acceptable use policy is in place, and new employees receive security awareness training, though annual training for all employees is not consistently performed.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unencrypted Web Server - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Port 80 is open. This poses a risk as any data transmitted over this port is unencrypted and susceptible to interception, leading to potential data breaches or exposure of sensitive information. This was identified by detecting an open port 80.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is recommended to immediately close port 80 if it is not essential for business operations. For long-term security, any web services running on port 80 should be migrated to use HTTPS with SSL/TLS encryption. Furthermore, the organization should implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to enhance access security. It is also crucial to establish and enforce annual security awareness training for all employees to ensure ongoing vigilance against evolving cyber threats.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security with MFA for critical systems and initial employee training. However, the presence of an unencrypted web server (Port 80) and gaps in MFA for computer logins and annual security awareness training indicate areas requiring immediate attention to strengthen the overall security posture and readiness against potential cyberattacks.</p>
