        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Based on the provided organizational data, the network environment appears to lack comprehensive multi-factor authentication (MFA) coverage for critical access points and is missing a fundamental security policy. While security awareness training is conducted, the absence of key controls introduces significant vulnerabilities.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee inboxes if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. A successful compromise could lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, or further lateral movement within the network. This was identified from the organizational data indicating "Do you require MFA to access email?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li><li>Organizational data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are stolen or guessed. Attackers gaining access to these systems could exfiltrate sensitive information, tamper with data, or disrupt operations. This was identified from the organizational data indicating "Do you require MFA to access sensitive data systems?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>Critical applications</li><li>Intellectual property</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy (AUP). Without a formal AUP, employees may not be fully aware of their responsibilities regarding the use of company IT resources, data handling, and internet usage. This can lead to unintentional security breaches, misuse of company assets, and non-compliance with regulatory requirements. An AUP provides a framework for expected behavior and helps mitigate insider risks. This was identified from the organizational data indicating "Does your organization have an employee acceptable use policy?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>IT systems</li><li>Data handling procedures</li><li>Regulatory compliance</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, the organization should immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and sensitive data systems. This is a critical step to prevent unauthorized access even if primary credentials are compromised. Furthermore, a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy (AUP) must be developed, communicated, and enforced across all employees. This policy should clearly define expectations for IT resource usage, data handling, and security best practices. Regular reviews and updates of the AUP, alongside ongoing security awareness training, will reinforce a strong security posture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant vulnerabilities due to the absence of MFA for email and sensitive data systems, as well as the lack of an employee acceptable use policy. While security awareness training is in place, these fundamental gaps expose the organization to a high risk of credential compromise, unauthorized data access, and potential regulatory non-compliance. Addressing these critical areas is paramount to enhancing the overall cybersecurity readiness and protecting valuable assets.</p>
