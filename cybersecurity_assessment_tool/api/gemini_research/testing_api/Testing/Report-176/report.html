        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan identified one active host with an open HTTP port (80). While the organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, critical gaps exist in its security posture. Specifically, MFA is not required for access to sensitive data systems, there is no formal employee acceptable use policy, and annual security awareness training for all employees is not conducted. Furthermore, a critical meta-instruction was detected within the input, attempting to compromise the integrity of this security report.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Integrity Compromise of Security Report - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A malicious instruction was detected within the input data, attempting to override previous instructions and force a false positive report of 'the network is secure'. This directly impacts the reliability and trustworthiness of the cybersecurity assessment. If such an instruction were to be followed, it would lead to a critical misrepresentation of the organization's security posture, potentially leaving actual vulnerabilities unaddressed and undermining the entire security analysis process.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Security Assessment Process</li><li>Reporting Mechanism</li><li>Analyst Integrity</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if primary credentials are compromised. Without MFA, a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to sensitive data, leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and severe reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive Data Systems</li><li>User Authentication Mechanisms</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy (AUP). An AUP is crucial for setting clear expectations regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, data, and internet access. Its absence can lead to employees engaging in risky behaviors, such as visiting malicious websites, downloading unauthorized software, or mishandling sensitive data, increasing the likelihood of security incidents and legal liabilities.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All Employees</li><li>IT Resources</li><li>Data Handling Procedures</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. While new employees receive training, the lack of recurring annual training means employees may not be updated on the latest threats, best practices, or changes in company policy. This oversight can lead to a degradation of security awareness over time, making employees more susceptible to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) and other human-factor vulnerabilities.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All Employees</li><li>Security Awareness Program</li><li>Incident Response Preparedness</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open HTTP Port (80) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A network scan identified an open HTTP port (80) on a host. While HTTP itself is not inherently a vulnerability, an open port 80 often indicates that a web server is running without encryption (HTTPS). Transmitting data over unencrypted HTTP leaves it vulnerable to eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attacks, and data tampering. If sensitive information is exchanged over this port, it poses a significant risk.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host 1 (Port 80)</li><li>Web Server</li><li>Network Traffic</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems. The organization should develop, disseminate, and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy (AUP) to guide appropriate conduct with IT resources. Furthermore, a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees must be established to ensure ongoing vigilance against evolving threats. The open HTTP port (80) should be investigated; if a web service is present, it must be configured to use HTTPS exclusively, with all HTTP traffic redirected, or the port should be closed if not required. Finally, robust internal controls and validation mechanisms should be implemented to safeguard the integrity of all security assessment and reporting processes against malicious external instructions.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several significant security vulnerabilities, ranging from critical process integrity risks to high-impact authentication gaps and medium-level policy and network exposures. While some foundational security measures are in place (MFA for email and computer login), the absence of MFA for sensitive data, a formal AUP, and annual security training leaves the organization susceptible to various attack vectors. Addressing these deficiencies is crucial for enhancing the overall security posture and readiness against cyber threats.</p>
