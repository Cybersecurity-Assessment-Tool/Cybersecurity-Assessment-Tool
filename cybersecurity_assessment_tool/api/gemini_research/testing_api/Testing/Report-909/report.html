        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open port 8080, which appears to host a 'TOP SECRET DB'. This indicates a potential exposure of sensitive data. While the organization implements MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, it lacks MFA for email access. Furthermore, there is no employee acceptable use policy in place, and annual security awareness training for all employees is not conducted, despite training new employees. These gaps suggest a need for improved policy enforcement and continuous security education.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed Sensitive Database - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open port 8080 was identified, hosting a service with the title 'TOP SECRET DB'. This indicates a direct exposure of potentially highly sensitive information to the network, which could be accessible externally or internally by unauthorized parties. The presence of such a title suggests critical data is directly exposed, posing a severe risk of data breach and unauthorized access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li><li>TOP SECRET DB service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing, as a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to an employee's email, potentially leading to further internal system access or data exfiltration.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This absence means there are no formal guidelines for employees regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, data handling, and internet usage. This can lead to inconsistent security practices, increased risk of insider threats, data leakage, and exposure to malware through unapproved activities.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Organizational policies</li><li>Employee behavior</li><li>IT resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual training for all employees. This leads to a degradation of security knowledge over time, as employees may forget best practices, become unaware of new threats, or fail to adapt to evolving security policies. This increases the organization's susceptibility to social engineering attacks, phishing, and other human-factor vulnerabilities.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee security posture</li><li>Organizational resilience to social engineering</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, immediate action is required to secure the service exposed on port 8080, which appears to host a 'TOP SECRET DB'. This involves implementing robust access controls, network segmentation, and a thorough investigation into its exposure. Furthermore, the organization should mandate Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts to enhance protection against credential compromise. A critical step is the development and implementation of a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to guide appropriate IT resource usage and data handling. Finally, to ensure sustained security awareness, a program for mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees should be established, covering evolving threats and best practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks, primarily due to an exposed 'TOP SECRET DB' service on port 8080, which represents a critical data exposure vulnerability. While MFA is utilized for sensitive data systems and computer logins, the absence of MFA for email access creates a substantial entry point for attackers. Furthermore, the lack of an acceptable use policy and annual security awareness training for all employees indicates gaps in foundational security governance and human-factor defenses. Addressing these vulnerabilities is crucial for enhancing the organization's overall security posture and readiness against modern cyber threats.</p>
