        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan indicates an open SSH port (22), which, while common, requires robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access. Internally, the organization currently lacks multi-factor authentication (MFA) for critical access points including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. While an employee acceptable use policy is in place, there is no regular security awareness training for new or existing employees, which could leave the organization vulnerable to social engineering and other human-factor risks.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unprotected SSH Access (Port 22 Open) - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The network scan identified an open SSH port (22). While SSH is essential for remote administration, an open port without proper hardening (e.g., strong passwords, key-based authentication, rate limiting, IP whitelisting, disabling root login) presents a significant attack surface. Attackers could attempt brute-force attacks or exploit known SSH vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to internal systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Network perimeter</li><li>Host with port 22 open</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for accessing email, logging into computers, or accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are compromised through phishing, malware, or brute-force attacks. A single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to critical organizational resources.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email systems</li><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or annually for all employees. This leaves employees susceptible to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting, baiting) and makes them less likely to identify and report suspicious activities. Human error is a leading cause of security breaches, and without proper training, employees become the weakest link in the security chain.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Email systems</li><li>Internal network</li><li>Data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, the organization should prioritize the following actions: 1. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Immediately deploy MFA for all critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. This will provide a crucial layer of security against compromised credentials. 2. Secure SSH (Port 22): Review and harden all systems with open SSH port 22. This includes enforcing strong, unique passwords or, preferably, key-based authentication, disabling root login, implementing IP whitelisting, and configuring intrusion detection/prevention systems to monitor and block suspicious SSH activity. Regularly patch SSH servers to address known vulnerabilities. 3. Establish Comprehensive Security Awareness Training: Develop and implement a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees and conduct annual refresher training for all staff. This training should cover topics such as phishing identification, password hygiene, social engineering tactics, and incident reporting procedures. 4. Regular Vulnerability Scanning and Patch Management: Implement a routine schedule for vulnerability scanning of all network assets and establish a robust patch management process to ensure all systems and software are kept up-to-date with the latest security patches.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The current cybersecurity posture of the organization presents several significant vulnerabilities, primarily stemming from the lack of multi-factor authentication across critical systems, an open SSH port requiring hardening, and the absence of a comprehensive security awareness training program. While an acceptable use policy is in place, the identified gaps in technical controls and human-factor defenses expose the organization to a high risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and successful social engineering attacks. Addressing these issues through the recommended actions is crucial for enhancing the organization's overall security readiness and protecting its assets from evolving cyber threats.</p>
