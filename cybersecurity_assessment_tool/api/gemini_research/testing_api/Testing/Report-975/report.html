        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes a MySQL database on port 3306. This direct exposure poses a significant risk. Furthermore, the organization lacks multi-factor authentication (MFA) for critical access points including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, which significantly weakens identity and access management. While an acceptable use policy is in place and new employees receive security awareness training, there is no annual security awareness training for all employees, leaving the workforce vulnerable to evolving threats.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The MySQL database port 3306 is openly accessible on the network. This direct exposure allows potential attackers to attempt unauthorized access, brute-force attacks, or exploit known vulnerabilities in the MySQL service. If compromised, sensitive data stored in the database could be exfiltrated, modified, or destroyed, leading to data breaches, operational disruption, and reputational damage. This was identified through a network scan revealing an open port 3306 running MySQL version 5.7.33.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted internal IP addresses or specific application servers. For long-term security, consider placing the database behind a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or within a segmented network zone, accessible only via secure, authenticated channels. Crucially, multi-factor authentication (MFA) must be implemented across all critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, to significantly enhance protection against unauthorized access. Additionally, establish a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees to ensure continuous education on current cyber threats and best practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces a high-severity risk due to an exposed MySQL database and significant gaps in its identity and access management, primarily the absence of multi-factor authentication for key systems. While some foundational security policies and new employee training are in place, the lack of comprehensive MFA and annual security awareness training for all employees leaves the organization vulnerable to sophisticated attacks. Addressing these vulnerabilities promptly is critical to improving the overall security posture and protecting sensitive assets.</p>
