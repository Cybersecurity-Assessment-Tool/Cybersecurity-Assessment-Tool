        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to cybersecurity through the implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, along with a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy and regular security awareness training. The provided network scan data indicates no immediately apparent external vulnerabilities, with all scanned hosts showing no open ports. However, a critical gap exists in the security posture regarding access to sensitive data systems, where MFA is not currently enforced.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for accessing sensitive data systems within the organization. This significantly elevates the risk of unauthorized access to critical and confidential information. If an attacker compromises a single authentication factor (e.g., a password) for an employee account, they could gain direct access to sensitive data without an additional layer of security. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational security policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts with access to sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>It is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems. This measure will significantly enhance the security of critical information by requiring an additional verification step beyond a password, thereby mitigating the risk of unauthorized access even if primary credentials are compromised. Furthermore, regularly review and update the list of systems classified as 'sensitive' to ensure comprehensive MFA coverage.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has established strong security practices for email and computer access, coupled with robust security awareness training, the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems represents a significant vulnerability. Addressing this critical gap is paramount to safeguarding the organization's most valuable assets and enhancing its overall cybersecurity readiness.</p>
