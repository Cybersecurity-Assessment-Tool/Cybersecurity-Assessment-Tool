        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently hosts a MySQL database (version 5.7.33) accessible via port 3306. While MFA is required for sensitive data systems and an acceptable use policy is in place, there are significant gaps in the overall security posture. Specifically, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for email access or computer logins. Furthermore, the organization lacks security awareness training for new employees and does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network. This exposes the database to potential unauthorized access, data breaches, and service disruption if not properly secured. The vulnerability was identified through a network scan showing port 3306 as open.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted IP addresses or internal networks. For a long-term solution, consider placing the database behind a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or implementing a secure bastion host for access. Additionally, critical security enhancements include mandating Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and computer logins to significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access. The organization should also establish and regularly conduct security awareness training for all new employees and implement annual refresher training for the entire workforce to foster a security-conscious culture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces a high-severity risk due to an exposed MySQL database, which could lead to data breaches or service disruption. Coupled with the absence of MFA for email and computer logins, and a lack of comprehensive security awareness training, the overall cybersecurity readiness is moderate to low. While positive steps like MFA for sensitive data systems and an acceptable use policy are in place, addressing the identified vulnerabilities and implementing the recommended security controls is crucial to enhance the organization's defensive posture and protect its assets.</p>
