        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization exhibits a commendable commitment to cybersecurity fundamentals, including mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy, and consistent security awareness training for both new and existing employees. However, a recent network scan identified a critical vulnerability: an open Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) port (3389) exposed to the internet. Additionally, a significant gap exists in the security posture as MFA is not required for accessing sensitive data systems, leaving critical information vulnerable to credential compromise.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>RDP Exposure - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed to the internet via an open port (3389). This allows external attackers to potentially attempt brute-force attacks, exploit RDP vulnerabilities, or leverage compromised credentials to gain unauthorized access to internal systems. This critical vulnerability was identified through network scanning.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>External IP address with port 3389 open</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if user credentials are compromised through phishing, malware, or other means, as a single factor of authentication is insufficient to protect high-value assets. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive Data Systems</li><li>User Accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>It is critically important to immediately close the exposed RDP port (3389) to eliminate direct external access and mitigate the risk of unauthorized entry. For any legitimate remote access requirements, a Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution should be implemented to ensure secure, encrypted connections. Furthermore, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be implemented for all sensitive data systems to significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access in the event of credential compromise. The organization should also continue its robust security awareness training programs, potentially expanding them to cover specific threats related to data access and remote work, and consider regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing to proactively identify and address potential security weaknesses.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a strong foundation in security awareness training and MFA for email and computer logins, indicating a proactive stance on general user security. However, the presence of an externally exposed RDP port poses an immediate and critical threat, while the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems represents a significant vulnerability that could lead to severe data breaches. Addressing these key areas will substantially enhance the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and readiness against sophisticated attacks, moving towards a more robust and resilient security environment.</p>
