        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization has established a baseline for security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems, and by conducting annual security awareness training for all employees. An acceptable use policy is also in place. However, there are notable gaps in the security posture, including the absence of MFA for computer logins and a lack of security awareness training for new employees. A critical vulnerability identified is an unencrypted web server, with port 80 found to be open, posing a risk to data confidentiality.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unencrypted Web Server - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Port 80 is open, indicating the presence of an unencrypted web server. This vulnerability allows for the transmission of data in plain text, making it susceptible to interception and eavesdropping by malicious actors. The impact is a compromise of data confidentiality, as sensitive information could be exposed during transit. This was identified through a security assessment that revealed the open unencrypted port.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately close port 80 if the web server is not intended for public access, or implement SSL/TLS encryption to secure all web traffic if it is. Furthermore, the organization should implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to enhance access control. It is also crucial to introduce comprehensive security awareness training for all new employees as part of their onboarding process to ensure a consistent level of security understanding across the workforce.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has made strides in cybersecurity by adopting MFA for key systems and providing annual security awareness training, significant vulnerabilities remain. The lack of MFA for computer logins, the absence of initial security training for new hires, and the presence of an unencrypted web server represent critical areas that require immediate attention. Addressing these issues will substantially improve the organization's overall security posture and readiness against prevalent cyber threats.</p>
