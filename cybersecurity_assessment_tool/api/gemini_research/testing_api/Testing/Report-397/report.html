        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes an Nginx web server (version 1.18.0) on port 443 (HTTPS). While MFA is required for computer logins and sensitive data systems, it is notably absent for email access. Furthermore, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees, despite training new hires.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Web Server Software - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nginx web server running on port 443 is version 1.18.0. This version is significantly outdated and likely contains known security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access, disrupt services, or compromise data. Keeping software up-to-date is crucial for patching known security flaws and mitigating potential exploits.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Nginx 1.18.0 web server</li><li>Port 443</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. Email is a primary vector for phishing attacks and often contains sensitive information. Without MFA, compromised credentials (e.g., via phishing or brute-force attacks) can lead directly to unauthorized access to an employee's email, potentially enabling further attacks like business email compromise (BEC) or data exfiltration.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee email accounts</li><li>Email access systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. An AUP defines the proper and acceptable use of organizational IT resources, including networks, systems, and data. Without clear guidelines, employees may unknowingly engage in risky behaviors (e.g., installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, sharing sensitive data inappropriately) that could introduce security vulnerabilities or legal liabilities.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational IT resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Ongoing Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual training for all employees. Cybersecurity threats evolve rapidly, and without regular updates, employees may become complacent or unaware of new attack techniques (e.g., advanced phishing, social engineering tactics). This increases the risk of human error leading to security incidents.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately update the Nginx web server to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities. Implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts is critical to prevent unauthorized access from compromised credentials. Furthermore, the organization should develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to guide proper conduct with IT resources. Finally, establishing a program for mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees is essential to keep the workforce informed about evolving threats and best security practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a mixed security posture. While some critical systems are protected by MFA, significant vulnerabilities exist due to outdated public-facing software and a lack of fundamental security controls related to email access, employee policies, and ongoing security education. Addressing these areas is crucial for enhancing the overall cybersecurity readiness and reducing the attack surface.</p>
