        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an Nginx web server (version 1.18.0) running on port 443 (HTTPS), indicating a public-facing web presence. While the organization conducts security awareness training for all employees, it lacks critical security controls such as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, there is no documented employee acceptable use policy, which can lead to inconsistent security practices and increased human-factor risks.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Without Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), email accounts are highly susceptible to credential stuffing, phishing, and brute-force attacks. A compromised email account can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and serve as an initial access point for further network penetration. This vulnerability was identified through the organization's self-reported security practices.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Access to systems containing sensitive data without MFA significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access. If user credentials are stolen or guessed, an attacker can directly access and potentially exfiltrate, tamper with, or destroy critical information without an additional layer of authentication. This vulnerability was identified through the organization's self-reported security practices.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Without a clear and enforced acceptable use policy, employees may unknowingly engage in risky behaviors such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive data. This lack of policy creates a significant governance gap, increases the likelihood of human-factor related security incidents, and makes it difficult to enforce consistent security practices. This vulnerability was identified through the organization's self-reported security practices.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Web Server Software - <span class="severity-Low">Low</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nginx web server (version 1.18.0) identified on port 443 is an older stable release. While not immediately critical, running outdated software can mean missing out on important security patches, performance improvements, and new features. Older versions may have known vulnerabilities that have been addressed in newer releases, making the server potentially susceptible to exploits. This vulnerability was identified via network scanning.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Web server (nginx 1.18.0)</li><li>Port 443</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and sensitive data systems to significantly enhance protection against unauthorized access. The organization should also develop, disseminate, and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to establish clear guidelines for secure behavior and data handling. Additionally, the Nginx web server should be updated to the latest stable version to ensure all known security patches are applied and to benefit from the most current security features.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security through regular security awareness training. However, significant vulnerabilities exist due to the absence of MFA for critical systems (email and sensitive data) and a lack of a formal acceptable use policy. These gaps expose the organization to a high risk of unauthorized access and human-factor related incidents. Addressing these core issues, along with maintaining up-to-date software, is crucial for improving the overall security posture and readiness against cyber threats.</p>
