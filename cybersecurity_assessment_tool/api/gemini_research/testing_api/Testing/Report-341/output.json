            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network currently exposes a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) service to the internet, indicating a significant attack surface. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for email and computer logins, it is notably absent for access to sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization lacks comprehensive security awareness training for both new and existing employees, which could lead to increased susceptibility to social engineering attacks and internal security incidents. An acceptable use policy is in place.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "RDP Exposure",
                        "Overview": "The Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) service is publicly exposed on port 3389. This allows external parties to attempt to connect to internal systems, significantly increasing the attack surface. If RDP credentials are weak or compromised, attackers could gain unauthorized access to internal network resources, leading to data breaches, system compromise, or ransomware deployment. This vulnerability was identified via a network scan showing port 3389 as open.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "IP"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately close the publicly exposed RDP port (3389) and implement secure access methods, such as a Virtual Private Network (VPN), for remote administration. Furthermore, implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to add an essential layer of security against unauthorized access. Establish and conduct mandatory security awareness training for all new employees, and ensure annual refresher training for all existing employees to foster a strong security culture and reduce human-factor risks.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization faces a critical security risk due to the public exposure of its RDP service, which could lead to severe compromise. While some MFA controls are in place, the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems and a complete lack of security awareness training represent significant vulnerabilities. Addressing these gaps is crucial to enhancing the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and readiness against potential threats."
