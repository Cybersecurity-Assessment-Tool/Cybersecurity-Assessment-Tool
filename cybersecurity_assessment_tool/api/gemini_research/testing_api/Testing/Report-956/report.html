        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open port 80, suggesting an exposed web service. While the organization has implemented multi-factor authentication (MFA) for computer logins and conducts regular security awareness training, critical gaps exist. Specifically, MFA is not enforced for accessing email or sensitive data systems, and there is a lack of an employee acceptable use policy.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open Port 80 - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open port 80 was detected during the network scan. This port is commonly used for HTTP traffic and indicates a web server or service is publicly accessible. Without proper security configurations, this can expose the organization to web-based attacks, information disclosure, or unauthorized access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li><li>Web Server/Service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No MFA for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing, as a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to an employee's email.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email System</li><li>Employee Email Accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk, as unauthorized access to these systems, even with a compromised password, could lead to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and severe reputational and financial damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive Data Systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>File Shares</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This means there are no formal guidelines or rules for how employees should use company IT resources, including internet, email, and devices. This can lead to misuse of company assets, increased exposure to malware, data leakage, and legal liabilities due to inappropriate online behavior.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All Employees</li><li>Company IT Resources</li><li>Network Infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediately review the service running on port 80; if it's a web server, ensure it is properly secured, patched, and configured with a Web Application Firewall (WAF, if applicable). If not intended for public access, restrict it via firewall rules. Mandate Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and enforce MFA for all access to sensitive data systems to protect critical information. Develop and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy, clearly outlining guidelines for IT resource usage, and ensure all employees are trained on and acknowledge this policy. Continue with regular security awareness training for all employees, reinforcing best practices and policy adherence.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security through MFA for computer logins and ongoing security awareness training. However, significant vulnerabilities remain, particularly the lack of MFA for email and sensitive data systems, and the absence of an acceptable use policy. The open port 80 also presents an immediate concern. The organization's current security posture indicates a moderate level of readiness with critical gaps that need urgent attention to mitigate high-impact risks and enhance overall resilience against cyber threats.</p>
