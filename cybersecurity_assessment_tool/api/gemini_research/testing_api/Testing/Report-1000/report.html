        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The provided network scan data indicates that no open ports were identified on the target, suggesting a potentially well-hardened perimeter or an incomplete scan. From an organizational readiness perspective, the company demonstrates a strong commitment to security through mandatory MFA for email and sensitive data systems, an established acceptable use policy, and regular security awareness training for all employees. However, a critical gap exists in the absence of multi-factor authentication for computer logins.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for employees to log into their computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised through phishing, malware, or brute-force attacks. Without a second factor, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's workstation and potentially the internal network. This was identified from the organizational data indicating "Do you require MFA to log into computers?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Internal network</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Implement mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins across the organization. This should be a top priority to significantly enhance the security posture against credential theft. Evaluate and deploy a robust MFA solution compatible with existing infrastructure, ensuring a smooth rollout and comprehensive user training. Additionally, regularly review and update security policies and conduct periodic penetration testing to identify and address any emerging vulnerabilities.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization exhibits commendable security practices in several areas, particularly with MFA for email and sensitive data, and consistent security awareness training, the absence of MFA for computer logins represents a critical vulnerability. Addressing this gap is paramount to bolstering overall cybersecurity readiness and protecting against common attack vectors involving compromised credentials.</p>
