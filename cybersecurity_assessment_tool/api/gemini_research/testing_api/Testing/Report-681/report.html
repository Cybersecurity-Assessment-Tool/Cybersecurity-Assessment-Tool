        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes a critical vulnerability with an open port 8080 hosting a service identified as 'TOP SECRET DB', indicating a severe risk of sensitive data exposure. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is mandated for computer logins and access to sensitive data systems, it is notably absent for email access, leaving a significant attack vector open. Furthermore, the organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees, which are crucial components for maintaining a strong human firewall and consistent security posture. New employees receive initial training, but ongoing education is missing.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unsecured 'TOP SECRET DB' on Port 8080 - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open port 8080 was identified during the network scan, hosting a service explicitly titled 'TOP SECRET DB'. This finding indicates a critical exposure of potentially highly sensitive information to the network, possibly without adequate authentication, authorization, or encryption. This poses an immediate and severe risk of unauthorized access, data exfiltration, and a major data breach, given the explicit naming suggesting the nature of the data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li><li>TOP SECRET DB service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly elevates the risk of email account compromise through common attack vectors such as phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks. A compromised email account can lead to business email compromise (BEC) scams, unauthorized access to other systems via password resets, and sensitive data exfiltration, impacting both financial and reputational integrity.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee email accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines and expectations for the appropriate use of company IT resources, employees may inadvertently or intentionally engage in activities that introduce security risks. This includes visiting malicious websites, installing unauthorized software, mishandling sensitive data, or engaging in other behaviors that can lead to malware infections, data loss, and compliance violations.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This gap means that existing employees may not be regularly updated on evolving cyber threats, new organizational policies, or best practices. Over time, this can lead to a degradation of security awareness, making employees more susceptible to social engineering attacks, phishing campaigns, and other human-centric vulnerabilities.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediate action is required to address the critical exposure of the 'TOP SECRET DB' on port 8080; this service must be secured with robust authentication and encryption, or removed if not essential and internet-facing. Implement mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts to significantly reduce the risk of credential compromise. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy (AUP) that clearly outlines expectations for IT resource usage and data handling, ensuring all employees acknowledge and understand it. Establish a recurring, mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees to keep them informed about the latest threats and best practices, thereby strengthening the human element of security. Additionally, conduct regular vulnerability scans and penetration tests to proactively identify and remediate security weaknesses across the network and applications.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks, primarily stemming from a critical data exposure on an open network port and fundamental gaps in its security posture related to email access, employee policies, and ongoing security awareness. While MFA is appropriately utilized for computer logins and sensitive data systems, the absence of MFA for email, an acceptable use policy, and annual security training creates substantial vulnerabilities that could lead to data breaches, operational disruptions, and reputational damage. Addressing these critical and high-severity findings promptly is essential to elevate the organization's overall security readiness and protect its sensitive assets.</p>
