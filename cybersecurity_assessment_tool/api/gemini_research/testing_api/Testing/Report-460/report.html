        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The provided network scan data indicates an empty target and no open ports, suggesting either a highly secure perimeter or a limited scope of the scan. From an organizational perspective, the company has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems, and an acceptable use policy is in place. However, there are notable gaps in security posture related to computer login security and employee training.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised through phishing, malware, or brute-force attacks. Without a second factor, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's workstation and potentially the internal network. This was identified directly from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Internal network</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of New Employee Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) as they may be less familiar with company policies, security best practices, and common attack vectors. This lack of initial training leaves the organization vulnerable to human error and targeted attacks exploiting new employees. This was identified directly from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. Regular training is crucial to keep employees informed about evolving threats, reinforce security policies, and maintain a strong security culture. Without periodic refreshers, employees may forget best practices, become complacent, or be unaware of new attack techniques, increasing the likelihood of successful social engineering or other human-factor attacks. This was identified directly from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to enhance workstation and network access security. Furthermore, a comprehensive security awareness training program should be established. This program must include mandatory training for all new employees upon onboarding and annual refresher training for all existing employees to ensure continuous education on evolving threats and best security practices. Regular training will significantly strengthen the human firewall and reduce the organization's susceptibility to social engineering and other human-factor attacks.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the provided network scan data did not reveal immediate technical vulnerabilities, the organizational data highlights critical gaps in the security posture. The absence of MFA for computer logins and the lack of both new hire and annual security awareness training represent significant risks that could lead to unauthorized access and successful social engineering attacks. Addressing these areas through the recommended implementations will substantially improve the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and reduce its attack surface.</p>
