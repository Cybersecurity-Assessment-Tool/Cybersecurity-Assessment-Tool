        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network assessment revealed an active host with an open SSH port (22), indicating a potential entry point. From an organizational security standpoint, there are significant gaps. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is not required for email access or computer logins, which are common vectors for initial compromise. Furthermore, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy, and new employees do not receive security awareness training, though annual training is provided for all existing employees. MFA is, however, appropriately implemented for sensitive data systems.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A critical vulnerability was identified where a service or system component, likely intended for internal network access, is exposed to the external network. This exposure, indicated by an open port (potentially SSH on port 22 as per scan data) on a public-facing IP, allows potential attackers to directly interact with a critical internal resource. The impact could range from unauthorized access and data exfiltration to full system compromise, given the critical severity. This was identified via network scanning.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediate action is required to address the 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability by implementing strict firewall rules to restrict access to exposed services (e.g., port 22) to only trusted IP ranges or VPNs. A comprehensive review of all public-facing services is recommended to ensure they are absolutely necessary and properly secured. Furthermore, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and computer logins to significantly enhance credential security. The organization should also develop and enforce a clear employee acceptable use policy to define expected behavior and security responsibilities. Finally, security awareness training must be extended to all new employees upon onboarding to ensure a consistent baseline of security knowledge across the entire workforce.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces a critical security risk with a 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability, which could lead to severe compromise. This is compounded by significant gaps in foundational security practices, including the absence of MFA for email and computer logins, a lack of an acceptable use policy, and insufficient security awareness training for new hires. While MFA is in place for sensitive data systems and annual training occurs, these deficiencies leave the organization highly susceptible to various cyber threats. Urgent remediation and strategic security enhancements are essential to improve the overall security posture and readiness.</p>
