            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and maintaining an employee acceptable use policy. However, significant gaps exist in critical areas such as MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, as well as a complete absence of security awareness training for both new and existing employees. The lack of network scan data or identified technical vulnerabilities suggests either a limited scope of assessment or a need for more comprehensive technical scanning.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Computer Logins",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for employees to log into their computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised, as a single factor (password) is insufficient to protect against modern attack techniques. This vulnerability was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employee computers",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems",
                        "Overview": "Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not enforced for accessing sensitive data systems. This exposes critical organizational data to a higher risk of breach. If an attacker gains access to a user's credentials, they could potentially access sensitive information without an additional layer of authentication. This vulnerability was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                    {
                        "Risk": "No Security Awareness Training for New Employees",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. This means new hires may not be aware of common cyber threats, organizational security policies, or best practices, making them more susceptible to phishing, social engineering, and other attacks, thereby increasing the overall human risk factor. This vulnerability was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "New employees",
                            "Organizational data and systems (via human error)"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "No Annual Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not provide security awareness training to all employees at least once per year. Without regular training, employees' knowledge of evolving cyber threats and security best practices can become outdated, leading to a higher likelihood of falling victim to attacks and compromising organizational security. This vulnerability was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "Organizational data and systems (via human error)"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and, critically, for all sensitive data systems. This will provide a robust additional layer of security against credential theft. Furthermore, a comprehensive security awareness training program should be established, including mandatory training for all new employees upon onboarding and annual refresher training for all staff. This will empower employees to recognize and report threats, reducing the risk of human error-induced breaches. Consider conducting regular network vulnerability scans to identify and remediate technical weaknesses.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to a lack of comprehensive Multi-Factor Authentication implementation and a complete absence of security awareness training programs. While MFA for email and an acceptable use policy are positive steps, the identified gaps in protecting computer logins and sensitive data systems, coupled with an untrained workforce, leave the organization vulnerable to common and advanced cyber threats. Addressing these foundational security practices is crucial for improving overall readiness and resilience against cyberattacks."
