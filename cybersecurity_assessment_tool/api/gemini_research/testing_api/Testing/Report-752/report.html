        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization exhibits a mixed security posture. While there are positive aspects such as regular security awareness training for new and existing employees, critical gaps exist in fundamental security controls. Specifically, the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, coupled with an exposed unencrypted web service on port 80, presents significant vulnerabilities. Additionally, the lack of an employee acceptable use policy indicates a potential gap in governance and user behavior management.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unsecured Web Service Exposure - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open port 80 (HTTP) was detected during the network scan, indicating a web service is exposed without encryption. This lack of encryption makes data transmitted over this port vulnerable to interception, man-in-the-middle attacks, and potential exploitation of underlying web server vulnerabilities if the service is not properly secured or patched. This was identified via the Nmap scan data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li><li>Web Server</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for email access. This significantly increases the risk of email account compromise through common attack vectors such as phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. A compromised email account can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and serve as a pivot point for further network penetration. This was identified from the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on email.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee email accounts</li><li>Email server/service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for computer logins. This makes individual endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if user credentials are stolen, guessed, or compromised through other means. Unauthorized access to a computer can lead to malware infection, data theft, and lateral movement within the network, escalating the impact of a breach. This was identified from the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on computer logins.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network endpoints</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines and expectations for appropriate use of company resources, employees may inadvertently or intentionally engage in activities that introduce security risks. This could include installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive data, increasing the likelihood of data breaches, malware infections, and compliance violations. This was identified from the organizational data indicating 'No' for an acceptable use policy.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and computer logins immediately. For the exposed web service on port 80, it should either be closed if not essential, or secured by implementing HTTPS with a valid SSL/TLS certificate to encrypt traffic. Furthermore, ensure the underlying web server and application are fully patched and hardened. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy (AUP) to establish clear guidelines for secure behavior and responsible use of company assets. Continue with the existing robust security awareness training programs to reinforce secure practices among all employees.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security through its commitment to security awareness training. However, significant vulnerabilities exist in critical areas such as access control and network hygiene. The absence of MFA for email and computer logins, an unencrypted web service, and the lack of an AUP collectively increase the organization's attack surface and risk profile. Addressing these core weaknesses is paramount to enhancing the overall security posture and readiness against evolving cyber threats, ensuring better protection of organizational assets and data.</p>
