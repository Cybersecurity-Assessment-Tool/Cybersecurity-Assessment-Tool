        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The network scan identified an open SSH port (22), indicating a potential entry point for remote access. Organizational data reveals critical gaps in Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) implementation for email and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the absence of an Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and initial security awareness training for new employees highlights weaknesses in foundational security practices and employee education.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unsecured Remote Access - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An Nmap scan identified an open SSH (port 22) service. If not properly secured with strong authentication, regular patching, and restricted access, this port can be a target for brute-force attacks or exploitation, potentially leading to unauthorized remote access to systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 22</li><li>Network perimeter</li><li>Remote access systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Email Account Compromise - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of email account compromise through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks, as a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to an employee's email.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li><li>Sensitive communications</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are stolen or guessed, potentially leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>Employee accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Uncontrolled Employee Behavior - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an Employee Acceptable Use Policy. Without a clear AUP, employees may engage in activities that introduce security risks (e.g., installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, improper data handling) due to a lack of defined guidelines and consequences.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network resources</li><li>Data handling practices</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>New Employee Security Blind Spots - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training upon joining the organization. This leaves them susceptible to common social engineering attacks (phishing, pretexting) and unaware of organizational security protocols from day one, increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Email system</li><li>Internal network</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Based on the identified vulnerabilities, the organization should implement several key security enhancements. Firstly, the open SSH port (22) must be secured by ensuring strong, unique passwords or key-based authentication, disabling root login, implementing rate limiting, and restricting access to trusted IP addresses only. Secondly, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) should be immediately implemented for all email access and, critically, for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access even if primary credentials are compromised. Furthermore, the organization needs to develop and enforce an Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) to clearly define expected behavior regarding IT resource usage and data handling. Finally, a comprehensive security awareness training program for all new employees should be established to educate them on common threats and organizational security practices from the outset.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several significant cybersecurity risks, primarily stemming from a lack of robust access controls and foundational security policies. The presence of an open SSH port, coupled with the absence of MFA for email and sensitive data systems, creates critical entry points for potential attackers. Additionally, the lack of an Acceptable Use Policy and initial security awareness training for new hires indicates gaps in establishing a strong security culture. While annual security training is conducted, these identified vulnerabilities suggest a need for immediate action to strengthen perimeter defenses, enhance identity and access management, and formalize internal security governance to improve overall readiness against cyber threats.</p>
