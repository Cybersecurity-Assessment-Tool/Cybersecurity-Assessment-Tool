                        "Overview": "New employees do not receive security awareness training upon joining the organization. This leaves them susceptible to common social engineering attacks (phishing, pretexting) and unaware of organizational security protocols from day one, increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents.",

                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "Based on the identified vulnerabilities, the organization should implement several key security enhancements. Firstly, the open SSH port (22) must be secured by ensuring strong, unique passwords or key-based authentication, disabling root login, implementing rate limiting, and restricting access to trusted IP addresses only. Secondly, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) should be immediately implemented for all email access and, critically, for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access even if primary credentials are compromised. Furthermore, the organization needs to develop and enforce an Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) to clearly define expected behavior regarding IT resource usage and data handling. Finally, a comprehensive security awareness training program for all new employees should be established to educate them on common threats and organizational security practices from the outset.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces several significant cybersecurity risks, primarily stemming from a lack of robust access controls and foundational security policies. The presence of an open SSH port, coupled with the absence of MFA for email and sensitive data systems, creates critical entry points for potential attackers. Additionally, the lack of an Acceptable Use Policy and initial security awareness training for new hires indicates gaps in establishing a strong security culture. While annual security training is conducted, these identified vulnerabilities suggest a need for immediate action to strengthen perimeter defenses, enhance identity and access management, and formalize internal security governance to improve overall readiness against cyber threats."
