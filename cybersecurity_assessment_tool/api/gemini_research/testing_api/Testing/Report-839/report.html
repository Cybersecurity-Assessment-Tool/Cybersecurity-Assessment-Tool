        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open SSH port (22), indicating a potential entry point that requires secure configuration. Internally, the organization has some robust security practices, including mandatory MFA for computer logins and annual security awareness training for all employees, as well as an acceptable use policy. However, significant gaps exist in critical areas: MFA is not required for accessing email or sensitive data systems, and new employees do not receive security awareness training. These omissions leave the organization vulnerable to phishing, unauthorized data access, and insider threats from new hires.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A critical service or system typically running on localhost is exposed, potentially allowing unauthorized access or control. This was identified through an internal assessment indicating a severe misconfiguration or lack of proper network segmentation, leading to a direct and exploitable pathway to internal resources.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH port (22) was detected during the network scan. While SSH is a secure protocol, an open port represents a potential attack vector if not properly secured with strong authentication, rate limiting, and regular patching. Unauthorized access via SSH could lead to full system compromise.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Network perimeter</li><li>Any host with port 22 open</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No MFA for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks. A compromised email account can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and further internal network access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>All employee email accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are stolen or compromised. The impact could include data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and significant reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>File shares containing sensitive information</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>New Employee Training Gap - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training upon onboarding. This means new hires may not be aware of organizational security policies, common threat vectors (like phishing), or best practices for handling sensitive information, increasing the risk of human error-induced security incidents.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Based on the identified vulnerabilities, the following recommendations are provided to enhance the organization's cybersecurity posture: Immediately investigate and remediate the "Localhost Exposed" vulnerability by reviewing network segmentation, firewall rules, and service configurations. For the open SSH port (22), implement robust security measures including disabling password authentication in favor of SSH keys, enforcing strong passphrase policies, implementing IP-based access restrictions, and enabling rate limiting. Mandate Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and access to sensitive data systems. Establish a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees as part of their onboarding process. Finally, conduct regular, scheduled vulnerability scans and periodic penetration tests to proactively identify and address new or emerging weaknesses in the network and applications.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security through existing MFA for computer logins, an acceptable use policy, and annual security awareness training for existing staff. However, critical vulnerabilities, including an exposed localhost service and an open SSH port, pose immediate and severe risks to the network infrastructure. Furthermore, the absence of MFA for email and sensitive data systems, coupled with a lack of security awareness training for new employees, creates significant human-centric attack vectors. Addressing these identified gaps, particularly the critical technical exposures and the MFA implementation across all high-value assets, is paramount to elevating the organization's overall security readiness and protecting against potential breaches and data loss.</p>
