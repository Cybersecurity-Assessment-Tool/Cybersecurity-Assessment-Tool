        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open port 8080 exposing a service titled 'TOP SECRET DB', indicating a critical vulnerability with potentially sensitive data directly accessible. Furthermore, the organization's security posture is significantly weakened by several policy and training deficiencies. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for computer logins or access to sensitive data systems, leaving critical assets vulnerable to credential compromise. The absence of an Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and a complete lack of security awareness training for both new and existing employees further exacerbates the risk of human error and social engineering attacks.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed Sensitive Database (Port 8080) - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An Nmap scan identified an open port 8080 with the title 'TOP SECRET DB'. This indicates a potentially sensitive database or application is directly exposed to the network, possibly without adequate authentication or access controls. Unauthorized access could lead to severe data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service, compromising critical information.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li><li>Service/Application on Port 8080</li><li>TOP SECRET DB</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised, as a single factor (password) is the only barrier protecting employee workstations and potentially internal network access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers</li><li>User authentication systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if user credentials are compromised, as attackers can bypass single-factor authentication more easily to gain direct access to sensitive information.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). Without an AUP, employees may not be aware of their responsibilities regarding company assets, data, and network usage, leading to potential misuse, security incidents, and compliance issues due to undefined boundaries and expectations.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company network</li><li>Company assets</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) and may inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities due to a lack of understanding of security best practices and company policies from the outset.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Overall organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Annual Security Awareness Training for All Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. Regular training is crucial to keep employees updated on evolving threats, reinforce security best practices, and maintain a strong human firewall against cyberattacks, preventing the erosion of security knowledge over time.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Overall organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediately address the exposed 'TOP SECRET DB' on port 8080 by implementing robust access controls, strong authentication, and network segmentation to prevent unauthorized access. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and, critically, for all sensitive data systems to significantly reduce the risk of credential compromise. Develop and enforce a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) to clearly define employee responsibilities regarding company assets and data. Establish mandatory security awareness training for all new employees during onboarding and implement annual refresher training for all staff to ensure continuous education on evolving threats and best practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks, primarily due to an exposed sensitive database and critical gaps in its authentication policies and security awareness programs. The lack of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, coupled with the absence of an AUP and regular security training, creates a highly vulnerable environment. Addressing these fundamental weaknesses is paramount to improving the organization's overall security posture and readiness against cyber threats.</p>
