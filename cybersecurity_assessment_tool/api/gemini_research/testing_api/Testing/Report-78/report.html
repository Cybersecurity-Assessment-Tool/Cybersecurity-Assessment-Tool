        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan indicated no open ports on the target. However, a review of organizational data reveals significant gaps in fundamental security controls. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is not required for accessing email, logging into computers, or accessing sensitive data systems. Furthermore, there is no employee acceptable use policy in place, and new employees do not receive security awareness training, although annual training is conducted for all employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unencrypted Web Server - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The presence of an unencrypted web server on Port 80 allows for potential eavesdropping and data interception, making any information transmitted over this port vulnerable to unauthorized access. This was identified as an existing vulnerability, though network scans indicated the port is currently closed.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Not requiring MFA for email access significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks. A compromised email account can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive communications, internal systems, and potential business email compromise (BEC) scams.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email access</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Without MFA for computer logins, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's workstation. This provides a foothold for lateral movement within the internal network, data exfiltration, and deployment of malware.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Internal network access</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The absence of MFA for systems containing sensitive data is a critical vulnerability. It allows single-factor authentication to access highly confidential information, making these systems prime targets for data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and severe reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Confidential information</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The lack of a formal acceptable use policy means employees may not be fully aware of their responsibilities regarding company assets, data handling, and internet usage. This can lead to unintentional misuse, data leakage, introduction of unauthorized software, or engagement in risky online behaviors.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee conduct</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Company assets</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees are often prime targets for social engineering attacks due to their unfamiliarity with organizational security protocols and common threats. Without initial security awareness training, they are more susceptible to phishing, malware, and other threats, posing an immediate and significant risk to the organization's security posture.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Overall security posture</li><li>Phishing susceptibility</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, including email systems, computer logins, and especially sensitive data systems, to significantly enhance credential security. For the identified unencrypted web server, ensure Port 80 is closed if not in use, or implement SSL/TLS encryption for all web traffic to protect data in transit. Furthermore, develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to clearly define expected behavior and responsibilities regarding company resources. Finally, establish mandatory security awareness training for all new employees upon onboarding, in addition to the existing annual training, to ensure a foundational understanding of cybersecurity best practices from day one.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for critical access points and a lack of foundational security policies and initial employee training. While network scans showed no immediate open ports, the organizational readiness assessment highlights severe vulnerabilities that could lead to account compromises, data breaches, and operational disruptions. Addressing these gaps, particularly the implementation of MFA and robust policy enforcement, is crucial for improving the overall security posture and protecting sensitive assets.</p>
