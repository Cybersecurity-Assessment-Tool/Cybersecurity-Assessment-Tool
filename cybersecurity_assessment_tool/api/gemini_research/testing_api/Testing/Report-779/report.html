        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization operates a network with at least one active host exposing an open SSH port (22). While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is utilized for email and sensitive data systems, it is notably absent for computer logins. Furthermore, the organization lacks fundamental security practices, including an employee acceptable use policy and any form of security awareness training for both new and existing employees. This indicates significant gaps in both technical and administrative security controls.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A critical vulnerability was identified where a localhost service or interface is exposed, potentially allowing unauthorized access or manipulation. This exposure, with a CVSS score of 10.0, indicates a severe risk of system compromise, data exfiltration, or service disruption if exploited. The exact nature of the exposed service requires further investigation, but its critical severity suggests direct access to sensitive system components.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unsecured SSH Port - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH port (22) was detected on an active host. While SSH is a legitimate service, an open port without proper hardening (e.g., strong authentication, disabled root login, rate limiting) presents a significant attack surface for brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or exploitation of SSH vulnerabilities. This could lead to unauthorized remote access to the system.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 22</li><li>Active Host IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee workstations and internal systems if credentials are compromised through phishing, malware, or other means. A single factor (password) is insufficient to protect against modern credential theft attacks.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee Computers</li><li>Internal Network Access</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without a clear AUP, employees may be unaware of their responsibilities regarding the use of company assets, data handling, and internet usage. This can lead to risky behaviors, data breaches, and non-compliance with industry regulations, as there are no defined guidelines for appropriate conduct.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Organizational Policy</li><li>Employee Conduct</li><li>Data Security</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training. This means that individuals joining the organization are immediately exposed to potential threats without understanding best practices for identifying phishing attempts, handling sensitive information, or recognizing social engineering tactics. This significantly increases the risk of human-factor security incidents from the outset.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New Employees</li><li>Organizational Security Culture</li><li>Human Factor Risk</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Annual Security Awareness Training for All Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. Regular training is crucial to keep employees updated on evolving threats, reinforce security best practices, and maintain a strong security posture. The absence of such training leads to a stale understanding of risks, making the workforce more susceptible to common and emerging cyber threats over time.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All Employees</li><li>Organizational Security Culture</li><li>Human Factor Risk</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, the organization should implement the following recommendations: 1. Address Localhost Exposure: Immediately investigate and remediate the "Localhost Exposed" vulnerability. This may involve reconfiguring network interfaces, applying strict firewall rules, or disabling unnecessary services to prevent unauthorized access to internal services. 2. Secure SSH Services: Implement robust security measures for the open SSH port (22). This includes disabling root login, enforcing key-based authentication, implementing strong password policies for any password-based access, configuring rate limiting, and regularly patching SSH server software. Consider restricting SSH access to only necessary internal IPs. 3. Implement MFA for Computer Logins: Mandate Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins across the organization. This adds a critical layer of security, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access even if passwords are compromised. 4. Develop and Enforce an Acceptable Use Policy: Create and formally implement a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). This policy should clearly define expectations for employee conduct regarding company assets, data, and network usage, and be communicated to all staff. 5. Establish Comprehensive Security Awareness Training: Develop and implement a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees upon onboarding. Additionally, establish a recurring annual security awareness training program for all existing employees to ensure continuous education on current threats and best practices. These programs should cover topics such as phishing, social engineering, password hygiene, and data handling.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks stemming from both technical vulnerabilities and critical gaps in administrative controls and employee training. The presence of an exposed localhost service and an open, potentially unsecured SSH port represents immediate technical threats that could lead to system compromise. Furthermore, the absence of MFA for computer logins, an acceptable use policy, and any form of security awareness training for employees creates a high human-factor risk and a weak overall security posture. Addressing these vulnerabilities and implementing the recommended security practices is crucial to enhance the organization's resilience against cyber threats and improve its overall readiness.</p>
