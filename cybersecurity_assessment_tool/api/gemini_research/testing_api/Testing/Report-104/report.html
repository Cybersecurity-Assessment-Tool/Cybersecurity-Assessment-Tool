        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational level of security with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) implemented for email and computer logins, and an acceptable use policy in place. However, significant gaps exist in critical areas, particularly regarding the protection of sensitive data systems, employee security awareness, and network hygiene. An open port 80 was identified, indicating potential unencrypted traffic or an exposed service.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if credentials are compromised. An attacker gaining access to a single set of credentials could potentially access sensitive data without an additional layer of security, leading to data breaches and compliance violations.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees are not provided with security awareness training. This leaves them vulnerable to social engineering attacks, phishing, malware, and other common cybersecurity threats from the outset. Untrained employees can inadvertently introduce new attack vectors into the organization, compromising security through human error.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. Regular and ongoing training is crucial to keep employees informed about evolving threats, best practices, and the organization's security policies. Without it, employee knowledge degrades over time, increasing susceptibility to sophisticated attacks and weakening the overall security posture.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open Port 80 (HTTP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A network scan identified an open port 80, typically used for unencrypted HTTP traffic. This could indicate that web services are running without encryption, exposing sensitive information transmitted over the network to eavesdropping, or that an outdated/unsecured web server is publicly accessible. This poses a risk for data interception and potential exploitation of web server vulnerabilities.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Network perimeter</li><li>Web servers</li><li>Data transmitted over HTTP</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access. Furthermore, establish a comprehensive security awareness training program that includes mandatory onboarding training for all new employees and annual refresher training for all existing staff. This will significantly improve the human firewall against social engineering and phishing attacks. Finally, investigate the service running on port 80; if it is a web server, ensure HTTPS is enforced for all traffic, and HTTP is either redirected or blocked. If it is another service, ensure it is necessary, properly secured, and not exposing unnecessary information.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has implemented some basic security controls like MFA for email and computer logins, and an acceptable use policy, its overall cybersecurity readiness is compromised by critical vulnerabilities. The absence of MFA for sensitive data systems, coupled with a lack of comprehensive and ongoing security awareness training, exposes the organization to significant risks from both external threats and internal human error. The presence of an open port 80 further highlights potential network security weaknesses. Addressing these areas is paramount to enhancing the organization's defense against cyber threats and protecting its sensitive assets.</p>
