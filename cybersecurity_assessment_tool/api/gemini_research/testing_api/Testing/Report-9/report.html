        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a mixed security posture. Positive aspects include the implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and access to sensitive data systems, as well as having an employee acceptable use policy in place. However, critical gaps exist in foundational security practices. Specifically, MFA is not required for email access, and there is a complete absence of security awareness training for both new employees and existing staff on an annual basis. A network scan identified an open port 8080, which was subsequently assessed as a false positive, indicating it is secured.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Email accounts are a primary target for phishing and credential stuffing attacks. Without MFA, compromised credentials can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive communications, intellectual property, and potentially other interconnected systems if credentials are reused. This vulnerability was identified by reviewing the organization's security policies regarding email access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>User accounts</li><li>Organizational data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient New Employee Security Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees are often unfamiliar with an organization's specific security policies, common threat vectors, and best practices. The absence of initial security awareness training significantly increases the risk of social engineering attacks, phishing attempts, and accidental data breaches by new hires. This was identified through an assessment of the organization's onboarding procedures.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Internal systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Regular and ongoing security awareness training is crucial to keep all employees updated on evolving cyber threats, reinforce secure behaviors, and maintain a strong security culture. Without annual training, employees may become complacent or unaware of new attack techniques, making the organization more susceptible to various cyber threats, including phishing, malware, and social engineering. This was identified through a review of the organization's ongoing security education programs.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Overall security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Port 8080 Secured (False Positive) - <span class="severity-Info">Info</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> During the network scan, port 8080 was identified as open and potentially hosting a 'TOP SECRET DB'. However, further investigation and verification confirmed that this port is securely configured and does not pose an active vulnerability. The initial finding was a false positive, and the port is deemed secure.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access. This will provide a crucial layer of defense against credential theft. Furthermore, a comprehensive security awareness training program should be established, including mandatory training for all new employees during their onboarding process and annual refresher training for all existing staff. These training initiatives should cover topics such as phishing recognition, secure browsing, data handling best practices, and social engineering prevention. Regularly reviewing and updating security policies, especially concerning human factors, will also contribute to a more resilient defense.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently exhibits a moderate level of cybersecurity readiness, with some robust controls in place for sensitive data access and computer logins. However, the absence of MFA for email and a structured, ongoing security awareness training program for all employees represents significant vulnerabilities that could be exploited through human-centric attacks. While a network scan identified an open port that was later confirmed as secure, the human element remains the most critical area for immediate improvement to mitigate potential breaches and strengthen the overall security posture.</p>
