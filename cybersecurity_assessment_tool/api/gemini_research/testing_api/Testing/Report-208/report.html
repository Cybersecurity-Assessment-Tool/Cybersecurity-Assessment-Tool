        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to foundational security controls by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. Network scan data indicates a well-secured external perimeter with no open ports identified, suggesting a robust initial defense posture. However, a review of organizational policies reveals critical gaps in employee acceptable use policies and ongoing security awareness training, which could expose the organization to internal threats and human-factor vulnerabilities.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The absence of a formal employee acceptable use policy means there are no clear guidelines for employees regarding the appropriate use of company assets, data, and network resources. This lack of policy can lead to employees unknowingly engaging in risky behaviors, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive information, increasing the likelihood of data breaches, malware infections, and compliance violations. This vulnerability was identified by reviewing the organization's policy documentation.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li><li>Company assets</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This oversight means that employees may not be regularly updated on evolving cyber threats, new company policies, or best practices for identifying and responding to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting). Over time, this can lead to a degradation of security knowledge and an increased susceptibility to human-factor attacks, which remain a primary vector for cyber incidents. This vulnerability was identified by reviewing the organization's training program schedule.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Email systems</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Internal network</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To enhance the organization's overall security posture, it is strongly recommended to develop and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy that clearly outlines expectations for the use of company resources and data. This policy should be communicated to all employees and regularly reviewed. Furthermore, establishing a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees is crucial. This training should cover current threat landscapes, social engineering tactics, data handling best practices, and incident reporting procedures to ensure that employees remain the first line of defense against cyber threats. While the network scan showed no open ports, continuous monitoring and regular vulnerability assessments of the external perimeter are advised to maintain this strong posture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently exhibits a mixed state of cybersecurity readiness. While strong technical controls like MFA and a seemingly secure external network perimeter are in place, significant vulnerabilities exist in the areas of employee policy and ongoing security awareness training. These gaps represent considerable human-factor risks that could undermine technical defenses. Addressing the lack of an acceptable use policy and implementing regular, comprehensive security awareness training for all employees are critical next steps to mature the organization's security program and significantly reduce its overall risk profile.</p>
