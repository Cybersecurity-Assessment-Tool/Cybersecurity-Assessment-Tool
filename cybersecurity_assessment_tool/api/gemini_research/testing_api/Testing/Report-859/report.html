        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization currently employs Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and computer logins, which is a positive security measure. However, there are significant gaps in security posture, particularly concerning sensitive data systems, employee policies, and security awareness training. The network scan also revealed an open SSH port, which requires careful management.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if an attacker compromises a user's credentials. Without a second factor of authentication, a stolen password alone can grant full access to critical and sensitive information, leading to data breaches, compliance violations, and reputational damage. This vulnerability was identified through the organization's self-reported security practices.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This absence means there are no clear guidelines for employees regarding the proper use of company IT resources, data, and internet access. This can lead to increased risks such as misuse of company assets, introduction of malware, data leakage, and non-compliance with industry regulations, as employees may unknowingly engage in risky behaviors. This vulnerability was identified through the organization's self-reported security practices.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Company data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) due to their unfamiliarity with company-specific security protocols and common threat indicators. Without initial training, they are more susceptible to falling victim to these attacks, which can lead to credential compromise, malware infections, or unauthorized access to internal systems. This vulnerability was identified through the organization's self-reported security practices.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Company systems</li><li>Company data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Annual Security Awareness Training for All Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. Regular training is essential to keep employees updated on evolving cyber threats, reinforce best practices, and maintain a strong security culture. The absence of annual training leads to a decay in security knowledge and vigilance over time, making the entire workforce more vulnerable to sophisticated phishing campaigns, social engineering, and other human-centric attacks. This vulnerability was identified through the organization's self-reported security practices.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company systems</li><li>Company data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port (Port 22) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An Nmap scan identified an open SSH port (22) on a host within the network. While SSH is a legitimate service for remote administration, an open port 22 is a common target for automated attacks such as brute-force attempts, credential stuffing, and exploitation of known SSH server vulnerabilities. If not properly secured with strong authentication (e.g., key-based authentication, MFA) and restricted access, it poses a significant risk for unauthorized remote access to the affected system. The specific host details were not provided in the scan data, but the presence of the open port is noted.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with open port 22</li><li>SSH service</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems immediately to prevent unauthorized access. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to clearly define responsibilities and acceptable behaviors regarding company IT resources. Establish mandatory security awareness training for all new employees during their onboarding process and implement annual refresher training for all existing employees to ensure continuous education on evolving cyber threats and best practices. For the identified open SSH port (22), ensure it is secured with strong, key-based authentication, disable password authentication, and restrict access to only necessary IP addresses or networks through firewall rules. Regularly patch and update the SSH server software to mitigate known vulnerabilities.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has implemented MFA for email and computer logins, critical vulnerabilities exist in the areas of sensitive data system access, employee policy, and security awareness training. The presence of an open SSH port also presents a potential attack vector. Addressing these identified risks through policy implementation, comprehensive training, and technical controls is crucial to significantly improve the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and reduce its susceptibility to various cyber threats.</p>
