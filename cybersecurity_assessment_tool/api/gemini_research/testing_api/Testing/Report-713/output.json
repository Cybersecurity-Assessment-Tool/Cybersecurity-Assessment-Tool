            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network currently exposes an RDP service on port 3389, indicating a potential entry point for attackers. While the organization has implemented MFA for email and sensitive data systems, it lacks MFA for computer logins, which could be a significant vulnerability if an attacker gains access to the network via RDP. An acceptable use policy is in place, but there is no security awareness training for new employees or annual training for all employees, which could lead to human-factor vulnerabilities like phishing or social engineering.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "RDP Exposure",
                        "Overview": "RDP exposed. This means that the Remote Desktop Protocol service is accessible from outside the internal network. This can allow attackers to attempt brute-force attacks or exploit known vulnerabilities in the RDP service to gain unauthorized access to internal systems. The impact could be full system compromise and data exfiltration. It was identified via network port scanning showing port 3389 open.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "External IP Address exposing port 3389"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately close the exposed RDP port (3389) to prevent unauthorized access attempts. For long-term secure remote access, implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution. Furthermore, the organization should implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to enhance endpoint security. Establishing a comprehensive security awareness training program for all new employees and conducting annual refresher training for all staff is crucial to address human-factor vulnerabilities and improve overall security posture.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces a critical vulnerability due to an exposed RDP service, which could lead to unauthorized system access. While some security measures like MFA for email and sensitive data are in place, the absence of MFA for computer logins and a lack of consistent security awareness training for employees significantly reduce the organization's overall readiness against cyber threats. Addressing these gaps is paramount to improving the security posture and protecting critical assets."
