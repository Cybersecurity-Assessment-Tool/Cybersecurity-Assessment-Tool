        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing MFA for email access and maintaining an acceptable use policy. New employees receive security awareness training. However, critical gaps exist in multi-factor authentication for computer logins and sensitive data systems, significantly increasing the risk of unauthorized access. Furthermore, the absence of annual security awareness training for all employees suggests a potential for outdated security practices and a lack of continuous reinforcement of best practices. Network scans indicate that while a host is up, port 80 is currently closed, which is a positive finding regarding direct unencrypted web exposure.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unencrypted Web Server - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A web server was identified as potentially exposing content over unencrypted HTTP (Port 80). While recent network scans indicate port 80 is currently closed, the initial finding suggests a past or potential misconfiguration. If port 80 were to become open without proper encryption, it would allow sensitive data to be intercepted in cleartext, leading to data breaches and compromise of user privacy. This risk was identified through a previous vulnerability assessment.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li><li>Web Server</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for employees to log into their computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised through phishing, keylogging, or brute-force attacks. Without a second factor, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's workstation and potentially the internal network. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee Workstations</li><li>Login Procedures</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not mandated for accessing sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk, as compromised credentials could allow unauthorized individuals direct access to confidential information, leading to severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and significant reputational damage. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive Data Systems</li><li>Access Control Mechanisms</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This lack of recurring training means employees may not be updated on the latest threats, best practices, or organizational policies, increasing the likelihood of successful social engineering attacks, phishing attempts, and other human-factor vulnerabilities. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All Employees</li><li>Security Training Program</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and, critically, for all sensitive data systems. This will significantly enhance protection against credential theft and unauthorized access. Furthermore, a comprehensive annual security awareness training program should be established for all employees to ensure continuous education on evolving cyber threats and best practices. Regarding the potential unencrypted web server, ensure port 80 remains closed and that all web services are configured to use HTTPS with valid SSL/TLS certificates.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization exhibits a mixed security posture, with some foundational controls in place such as MFA for email and initial employee training. However, the absence of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, coupled with a lack of annual security awareness training, represents significant vulnerabilities that could lead to unauthorized access and data breaches. Addressing these critical gaps is paramount to improving the overall cybersecurity readiness and protecting organizational assets.</p>
