        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan identified an open SSH port (22) on at least one host. While the organization implements Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and conducts regular security awareness training for all employees, significant gaps exist in its security posture. Specifically, MFA is not required for accessing email or sensitive data systems, and there is no formal employee acceptable use policy in place. These factors indicate a mixed readiness level, with some foundational security practices present but critical vulnerabilities in key areas.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unsecured SSH Access - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH port (22) was detected on a network host. Without proper hardening measures such as disabling password authentication, enforcing strong SSH keys, and implementing rate limiting, this port presents a significant attack surface. It can be exploited for brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or unauthorized access, potentially leading to system compromise and lateral movement within the network. The scan identified the presence of the open port, but further investigation is needed to assess its configuration.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with open port 22</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Email Account Compromise via Weak Authentication - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This critical oversight leaves email accounts highly vulnerable to compromise through phishing attacks, brute-force attempts, or credential stuffing. A compromised email account can lead to business email compromise (BEC) scams, data exfiltration, unauthorized access to other linked services, and significant reputational damage. The lack of MFA was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>All employee email accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not enforced for accessing systems that contain sensitive data. This exposes critical organizational data to a high risk of unauthorized access if primary credentials are compromised. Attackers gaining access to these systems could exfiltrate, alter, or destroy sensitive information, leading to severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, financial penalties, and loss of customer trust. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Uncontrolled Employee Behavior & Data Misuse - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy (AUP). Without a formal AUP, there are no clear guidelines for employees regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, handling of sensitive data, internet usage, and security best practices. This absence increases the risk of accidental data leakage, malware infections from inappropriate web browsing, non-compliance with data protection regulations, and potential legal liabilities arising from employee misconduct. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's cybersecurity posture, several key recommendations are advised. Firstly, immediately implement and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and, critically, for all access to sensitive data systems. This will drastically reduce the risk of unauthorized access even if primary credentials are compromised. Secondly, address the open SSH port by implementing robust security measures, including disabling password authentication, enforcing SSH key-based authentication, implementing rate limiting, and ensuring regular patching and configuration reviews. Thirdly, develop, disseminate, and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy (AUP) that clearly outlines expectations for IT resource usage, data handling, and security protocols. While the organization currently conducts security awareness training, it is recommended to reinforce these new policies and best practices through ongoing training sessions, ensuring all employees understand their roles in maintaining a secure environment.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of cybersecurity through its implementation of MFA for computer logins and regular security awareness training. However, critical vulnerabilities exist, particularly with the absence of MFA for email and sensitive data systems, and the lack of a formal acceptable use policy. The presence of an open SSH port also warrants immediate attention. Addressing these high-severity risks is paramount to prevent potential data breaches, unauthorized access, and compliance failures, thereby significantly improving the organization's overall security readiness.</p>
