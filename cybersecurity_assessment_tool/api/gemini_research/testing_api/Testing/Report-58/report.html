        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's current security posture, based on provided organizational data, indicates several areas for improvement in foundational security practices. While annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees, critical controls like Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) are not universally enforced for email and computer logins. Additionally, essential policies such as an Acceptable Use Policy are absent, and new employees do not receive initial security awareness training upon onboarding. No network scan data or existing technical vulnerabilities were provided, so the assessment focuses on policy and procedural gaps.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks. Compromised email accounts can lead to further internal system breaches, data exfiltration, and business email compromise (BEC) scams. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on email access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email accounts</li><li>Email servers</li><li>User credentials</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for employees to log into their computers. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials (username/password) are compromised. An attacker gaining access to a workstation can potentially move laterally within the network, access sensitive data, or deploy malware. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on computer login.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network access points</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. An AUP defines the proper use of organizational assets, systems, and data, setting clear expectations for employee behavior. Without an AUP, there is an increased risk of misuse of company resources, unauthorized software installations, data leakage, and non-compliance with regulatory requirements, as employees may not be aware of their responsibilities or prohibited actions. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for an AUP.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational IT assets</li><li>Data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training upon joining the organization. This means new hires may not be immediately aware of critical security policies, common threats (e.g., phishing), and best practices for protecting organizational assets and data. This oversight increases the likelihood of new employees inadvertently introducing vulnerabilities or falling victim to social engineering attacks during their initial employment period. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for new employee security awareness training.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network security</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and computer logins. This critical control will drastically reduce the risk of credential-based attacks. Furthermore, the organization should develop and enforce a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) to clearly define expected behavior regarding IT asset usage and data handling. Finally, establishing mandatory security awareness training for all new employees upon onboarding is crucial to ensure they are equipped with the necessary knowledge to identify and mitigate common cyber threats from day one.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several significant security vulnerabilities primarily stemming from gaps in foundational security policies and controls. The absence of MFA for email and computer logins, coupled with the lack of an Acceptable Use Policy and initial security awareness training for new employees, exposes the organization to a heightened risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and operational disruptions. While annual security awareness training is a positive step, addressing these identified weaknesses is paramount to achieving a more robust and resilient cybersecurity posture.</p>
