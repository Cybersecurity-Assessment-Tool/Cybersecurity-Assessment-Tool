        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The network scan data indicates the presence of an open SSH port (port 22) on at least one host within the organization's network. This suggests potential for remote access, which requires robust security measures. Organizational data reveals significant gaps in security posture, particularly concerning multi-factor authentication (MFA), employee policies, and security awareness training. While MFA is used for computer logins, it is notably absent for email and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization lacks an acceptable use policy and comprehensive security awareness training programs for both new and existing employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks. Compromised email accounts can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and further internal network penetration. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email systems</li><li>Employee email accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk, as it allows attackers who obtain a single set of credentials to gain direct access to confidential and critical information. A breach of these systems could result in severe data loss, regulatory fines, reputational damage, and significant financial impact. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Confidential data repositories</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines, employees may engage in activities that inadvertently or intentionally compromise security, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or misusing company resources. This can lead to malware infections, data leakage, and legal liabilities. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational IT resources</li><li>Data integrity</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often the most susceptible to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, vishing) due to unfamiliarity with company policies and common threat vectors. This increases the likelihood of successful attacks that could lead to credential theft, malware deployment, or unauthorized access. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Annual Security Awareness Training for All Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not provide annual security awareness training for all employees. Without regular training, employees may not be updated on the latest threats, phishing techniques, or evolving security best practices. This leads to a degradation of security awareness over time, making the entire workforce more vulnerable to human-factor attacks and increasing the risk of security incidents. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port (Port 22) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH port (port 22) was detected on a host within the network. While SSH is a legitimate service for secure remote access, an open port presents a potential attack surface. Without proper hardening (e.g., strong, unique passwords, key-based authentication, rate limiting, IP restrictions, and ideally, MFA), this port can be targeted by brute-force attacks or exploited if the SSH server software has known vulnerabilities. This vulnerability was identified through the network scan.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Network perimeter</li><li>SSH server</li><li>Remote access infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and sensitive data systems immediately. This is a critical step to prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to establish clear guidelines for IT resource usage and employee conduct. Furthermore, establish and maintain a robust security awareness training program, ensuring all new employees receive initial training and all employees undergo annual refresher training to stay informed about current threats and best practices. For the open SSH port, implement strong security controls such as using SSH keys instead of passwords, disabling root login, configuring strict access controls (e.g., IP whitelisting), implementing rate limiting, and ensuring the SSH server software is regularly patched and updated. Consider placing SSH behind a VPN or bastion host for an additional layer of security.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to a lack of fundamental security controls, particularly in multi-factor authentication for critical systems and comprehensive security awareness training. The absence of an acceptable use policy further exacerbates the human element risk. While MFA is used for computer logins, the gaps in email and sensitive data system protection, combined with an open SSH port, create multiple avenues for potential attackers. Addressing these vulnerabilities through the recommended actions is crucial to significantly enhance the organization's overall security posture and readiness against cyber threats.</p>
