        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The network scan identified one active host with an open SSH (port 22) service. While this provides limited insight into the overall network infrastructure, the organizational data reveals significant gaps in security policies and employee training. Specifically, the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, the lack of an employee acceptable use policy, and insufficient annual security awareness training represent critical vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. A compromised email account can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and unauthorized access to other linked services.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>All employee email accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MFA is not required for logging into organizational computers. This leaves user accounts vulnerable to unauthorized access if passwords are stolen, guessed, or cracked. Successful compromise of a computer login can lead to lateral movement within the network, installation of malware, and access to sensitive data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All organizational computers</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines, employees may engage in activities that inadvertently introduce security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive data. This increases the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. This leaves employees susceptible to evolving threats like advanced phishing campaigns, social engineering tactics, and malware. A lack of regular reinforcement means employees may forget best practices, increasing the risk of successful attacks.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network security</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port (22) - <span class="severity-Low">Low</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH port (22) was detected on an active host. While SSH is essential for remote administration, it represents a potential attack vector if not properly secured. Without strong authentication (e.g., key-based authentication, disabled password login), rate limiting, and regular patching, this port could be targeted by brute-force attacks or exploited via unpatched vulnerabilities, leading to unauthorized access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Network host (specific IP unknown)</li><li>SSH service</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and computer logins immediately. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy (AUP) that clearly outlines expected behavior regarding IT resources and data handling. Furthermore, establish and maintain a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees, covering current threats and best practices. For the open SSH port, ensure strong, key-based authentication is enforced, password logins are disabled, and the SSH service is regularly patched and configured with appropriate access controls and rate limiting.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to the absence of fundamental security controls and policies. The lack of MFA for critical access points and the absence of clear employee guidelines and regular security training create a vulnerable environment. While the network scan provided limited technical vulnerabilities, the organizational data highlights a low state of readiness against common and impactful cyber threats. Addressing these foundational issues is paramount to improving the overall security posture.</p>
