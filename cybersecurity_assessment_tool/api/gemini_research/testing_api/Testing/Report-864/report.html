        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Based on the provided organizational data, the network's specific technical details are unavailable due to broken scan data. However, an assessment of the organization's security posture reveals several critical gaps in foundational security practices. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required for computer logins and sensitive data systems, it is notably absent for email access. Furthermore, the organization lacks an Employee Acceptable Use Policy and does not conduct security awareness training for new employees, indicating significant human-factor vulnerabilities.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly elevates the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive communications and data in the event of compromised credentials, making email a prime target for phishing and account takeover attacks. A single compromised email account can lead to broader organizational breaches.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email accounts</li><li>User credentials</li><li>Organizational communication</li><li>Sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently operates without a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). This lack of clear guidelines means employees may not be fully aware of their responsibilities regarding the proper use of company IT resources, data handling, internet usage, and security protocols. This can lead to inconsistent security practices, increased risk of data leakage, and potential non-compliance with industry regulations.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Data handling procedures</li><li>Compliance posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not provide security awareness training specifically for new employees during their onboarding process. New hires are often more susceptible to social engineering tactics, such as phishing and pretexting, due to their unfamiliarity with company-specific security policies and common threat indicators. This oversight creates an immediate and exploitable vulnerability from the moment a new employee joins.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li><li>Susceptibility to social engineering attacks</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access. Concurrently, a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) should be developed, communicated, and enforced across all staff to establish clear guidelines for IT resource usage and data handling. Furthermore, a critical step is to integrate mandatory security awareness training into the onboarding process for all new employees, complementing the existing annual training for all staff. These measures will significantly enhance the organization's defense against credential compromise, human-factor exploits, and improve overall security hygiene.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The current assessment highlights a mixed state of cybersecurity readiness. While MFA is in place for critical systems, the absence of MFA for email, a formal Acceptable Use Policy, and dedicated security awareness training for new employees represent significant vulnerabilities. These gaps expose the organization to elevated risks of unauthorized access, data breaches, and social engineering attacks. Addressing these fundamental security practices is crucial for strengthening the overall security posture and reducing the attack surface.</p>
