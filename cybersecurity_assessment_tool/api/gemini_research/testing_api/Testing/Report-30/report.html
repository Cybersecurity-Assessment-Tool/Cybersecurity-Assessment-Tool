        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a proactive stance on security awareness training, conducting it for new employees and annually for all staff, and has an acceptable use policy in place. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is utilized for email and sensitive data systems. However, a key area for improvement is the lack of MFA for computer logins. A network scan identified a host as active, and a specific vulnerability related to an unencrypted web server was noted, indicating potential exposure through port 80.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unencrypted Web Server - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Port 80 is open, indicating an unencrypted web server is potentially exposed. This allows for unencrypted communication, making data transmitted over this port vulnerable to interception and exposure. The risk was identified by detecting an open port 80 during the assessment.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to significantly enhance access security. For the unencrypted web server vulnerability, if port 80 is not essential, it should be closed. If a web server is intended to be public-facing, it is crucial to implement SSL/TLS encryption by obtaining and configuring an SSL certificate to secure all web traffic and prevent data interception.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization has a foundational security posture with good practices in security awareness training and acceptable use policies, alongside MFA for critical systems like email and sensitive data. However, the absence of MFA for computer logins and the presence of an unencrypted web server on port 80 represent notable vulnerabilities that could be exploited. Addressing these specific areas will significantly enhance the overall security readiness and reduce the attack surface.</p>
