        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open port 8080 hosting a service titled "TOP SECRET DB," indicating a potential exposure of highly sensitive data. Furthermore, the organization lacks fundamental security controls such as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. There is also no employee acceptable use policy, and annual security awareness training is not conducted for all employees, despite new employees receiving initial training. These factors collectively point to significant security posture weaknesses.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed "TOP SECRET DB" on Port 8080 - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An Nmap scan identified an open port 8080 with the HTTP title "TOP SECRET DB." This indicates that a database or application containing highly sensitive information is potentially exposed to the network, and possibly the internet, without adequate protection. Unauthorized access to this system could lead to severe data breaches, intellectual property theft, and significant reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li><li>TOP SECRET DB service/application</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for email access, computer logins, or sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or stolen credentials. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker access to critical systems and data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email systems</li><li>Employee workstations/laptops</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an acceptable use policy (AUP) for employees. This absence means there are no clear guidelines or rules regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, data handling, and internet usage. This can lead to employees inadvertently or intentionally engaging in risky behaviors, increasing the likelihood of security incidents, data leakage, and compliance violations.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational IT resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual training for all employees. This leaves existing employees potentially unaware of evolving threats, best practices, and organizational policies. A lack of regular training increases the risk of employees falling victim to phishing attacks, social engineering, and other human-centric exploits, thereby compromising organizational security.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data and systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediately investigate the service running on port 8080. If it is not intended to be publicly accessible, restrict network access to only authorized internal IP addresses or completely shut down the service if it's not critical. Implement strong authentication and authorization controls if it must remain accessible. Conduct a thorough vulnerability assessment and penetration test on this specific service. Prioritize the deployment of MFA across all critical systems, starting with email, sensitive data systems, and then computer logins. This is a fundamental control to significantly reduce the risk of credential-based attacks. Create a comprehensive AUP that clearly outlines employee responsibilities regarding IT asset usage, data handling, and security best practices. Ensure all employees acknowledge and understand this policy. Implement a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees. This training should cover current threats, phishing recognition, data handling, and the organization's security policies. Implement a routine schedule for network vulnerability scanning and penetration testing to proactively identify and address security weaknesses.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks due to an exposed sensitive database, a complete lack of Multi-Factor Authentication across critical systems, the absence of an acceptable use policy, and insufficient ongoing security awareness training. These deficiencies create a highly vulnerable environment susceptible to data breaches, unauthorized access, and operational disruption. Addressing these fundamental security gaps is paramount to improving the organization's overall security posture and readiness against modern cyber threats.</p>
