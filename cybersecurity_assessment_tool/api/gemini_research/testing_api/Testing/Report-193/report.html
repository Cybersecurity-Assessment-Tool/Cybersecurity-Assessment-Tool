        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open HTTPS port (443) running Nginx version 1.18.0. Organizational data indicates a proactive stance on MFA for email and sensitive data systems, and annual security awareness training for all employees. However, critical gaps exist in authentication for computer logins and initial security training for new employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Weak Authentication for Computer Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to internal systems if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. A single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to an employee's workstation and potentially the internal network, leading to data breaches or further internal compromise. This vulnerability was identified from the organizational security policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Internal network access points</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate New Employee Security Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. This leaves new hires vulnerable to common social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) and unaware of organizational security policies and best practices from day one. Without initial training, new employees are more likely to fall victim to scams, mishandle sensitive information, or introduce malware, thereby increasing the overall human risk factor for the organization. This vulnerability was identified from the organizational security policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network security</li><li>Employee onboarding process</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins across the organization. This will significantly enhance protection against credential theft and unauthorized access. Additionally, a mandatory security awareness training program should be established for all new employees as part of their onboarding process. This training should cover common threats, organizational security policies, and best practices to ensure new hires are security-conscious from day one. Regularly review and update the acceptable use policy and ensure all employees, including new hires, acknowledge and understand it.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization demonstrates good practices in some areas, such as MFA for email and sensitive data, and annual security training, the lack of MFA for computer logins and initial security training for new employees presents significant vulnerabilities. Addressing these critical gaps is essential to strengthen the overall security posture and reduce the risk of unauthorized access and human-factor related incidents.</p>
