        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes an RDP service (port 3389) to the internet, presenting a critical vulnerability. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is utilized for email access, it is not enforced for computer logins or access to sensitive data systems, which represents a significant security gap. The organization has an acceptable use policy in place and conducts annual security awareness training for all employees. However, there is no dedicated security awareness training for new employees during their onboarding process.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>RDP Exposure - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This risk involves the exposure of Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) services to the internet, identified by an open port 3389 (ms-wbt-server) during network scanning. This exposure allows potential attackers to attempt brute-force attacks or exploit RDP vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to internal systems. The impact could range from data exfiltration and system compromise to the deployment of ransomware, posing a critical threat to the organization's assets and operations.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately close the exposed RDP port (3389) to the public internet. For any necessary remote access, implement a secure Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution that requires strong authentication. Furthermore, implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and access to sensitive data systems to significantly enhance protection against credential theft. Establish a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees as part of their onboarding process to ensure they are equipped with essential cybersecurity knowledge from day one.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces a critical security risk due to an exposed RDP service, which could lead to unauthorized access and severe operational disruption. While some foundational security practices are in place, such as an acceptable use policy and annual security awareness training, the absence of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, coupled with a lack of security training for new hires, indicates significant areas for improvement. Addressing these vulnerabilities and implementing the recommended security controls is paramount to bolstering the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and readiness against evolving threats.</p>
