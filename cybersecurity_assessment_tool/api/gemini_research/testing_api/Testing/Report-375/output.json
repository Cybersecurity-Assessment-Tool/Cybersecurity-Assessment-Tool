            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network currently exposes a MySQL database on port 3306. Internally, the organization utilizes Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems, but not for computer logins. There is an active security awareness training program for both new and existing employees, conducted at least once per year. However, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Database Exposure",
                        "Overview": "MySQL port 3306 is open to the network, potentially exposing the database to unauthorized access or attacks. This was identified through network scanning which revealed the open port and the running MySQL service version 5.7.33. The impact could range from data leakage to full database compromise.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Port 3306 (MySQL)"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted IP addresses or internal networks. For long-term security, consider implementing a Virtual Private Network (VPN) for secure remote access to the database. Furthermore, it is crucial to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to enhance endpoint security. Finally, develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to clearly define expected behavior and security responsibilities.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization demonstrates a moderate level of cybersecurity readiness, with strengths in security awareness training and MFA for critical systems like email and sensitive data. However, the open MySQL port 3306 represents a significant vulnerability, posing a high risk of database exposure. The absence of MFA for computer logins and a formal acceptable use policy are additional areas that require immediate attention to strengthen the overall security posture and reduce the attack surface."
