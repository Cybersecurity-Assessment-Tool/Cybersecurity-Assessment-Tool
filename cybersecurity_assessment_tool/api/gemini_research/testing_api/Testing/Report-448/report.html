        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a mixed security posture. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for email and sensitive data systems, it is notably absent for computer logins. Furthermore, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct security awareness training for new employees, although annual training is provided for all existing employees. The network scan data provided was minimal, indicating no open ports on the scanned target, which limits the scope of technical vulnerability assessment in this report.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access. If an attacker obtains an employee's username and password through phishing, malware, or other means, they can gain direct access to the employee's workstation and potentially the internal network without a second layer of verification. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA requirement to log into computers.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Internal network access</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Without an Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), there are no clear guidelines for employees regarding the proper and secure use of company IT resources, data, and internet access. This lack of policy can lead to increased risks such as data leakage, introduction of malware through unapproved software or websites, non-compliance with regulations, and general misuse of company assets. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data stating 'No' for an employee acceptable use policy.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) due to their unfamiliarity with company-specific security protocols, common threats, and internal communication practices. This oversight leaves the organization vulnerable during a critical onboarding period, as new employees may inadvertently introduce risks. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for security awareness training for new employees.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to establish a critical second layer of defense against unauthorized access. Developing and enforcing a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) is crucial to provide clear guidelines for secure behavior and resource utilization. Furthermore, establishing mandatory security awareness training as part of the onboarding process for all new employees will significantly reduce the risk of social engineering attacks and ensure a consistent baseline of security knowledge across the workforce from day one. Regular review and updates of these policies and training programs are also advised.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several significant vulnerabilities primarily stemming from gaps in its security policies and employee training, particularly concerning computer login security and new employee onboarding. While MFA is in place for some critical systems, its absence for computer logins, coupled with the lack of an AUP and new employee security training, creates exploitable weaknesses. Addressing these areas is paramount to enhancing the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and readiness against common threats.</p>
