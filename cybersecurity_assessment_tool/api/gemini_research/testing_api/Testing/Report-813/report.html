        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization operates a network with at least one active host. A critical vulnerability was identified where port 8080 is open, exposing a service explicitly titled "TOP SECRET DB". This indicates a severe risk of unauthorized access to highly sensitive information. While the organization demonstrates good practices in security awareness training and acceptable use policies, and uses MFA for computer logins, the lack of MFA for email and, critically, for sensitive data systems, significantly exacerbates the risk posed by the exposed database.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Database - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open port 8080 was identified, exposing a service titled "TOP SECRET DB". This indicates that a potentially sensitive database or application is directly accessible from the network, possibly without adequate authentication or authorization. The presence of "TOP SECRET DB" in the HTTP title suggests critical data could be at risk. Unauthorized access could lead to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li><li>TOP SECRET DB service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are compromised, especially given the discovery of an exposed 'TOP SECRET DB' service.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User authentication processes</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Email - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access email. Email accounts are frequently targeted by attackers as a gateway to other systems and sensitive information. Without MFA, a compromised email account can lead to broader organizational compromise.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email access</li><li>User authentication processes</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediate action is required to address the critical vulnerability of the exposed 'TOP SECRET DB' service on port 8080. This port should be immediately closed to external access. If the service is essential, it must be placed behind a robust firewall, secured with strong authentication (preferably multi-factor authentication), and only accessible to authorized personnel via secure channels (e.g., VPN). A thorough audit of the 'TOP SECRET DB' application is essential to understand its purpose, data stored, and existing security controls. Furthermore, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be mandated for all access to sensitive data systems, including the 'TOP SECRET DB' if it must remain accessible, and extended to email access to prevent account compromise. Implementing network segmentation to isolate sensitive systems from the general network will also limit the blast radius in case of a breach. Regular, comprehensive vulnerability scans and penetration tests should be conducted to proactively identify and address security weaknesses.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization faces a critical security risk due to an exposed 'TOP SECRET DB' service on port 8080, which could lead to a severe data breach. While the organization has foundational security awareness and policy controls, the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems and email, combined with this direct exposure, indicates a significant gap in its security posture. Urgent remediation of the exposed database and broader implementation of MFA are essential to improve the organization's readiness against cyber threats.</p>
