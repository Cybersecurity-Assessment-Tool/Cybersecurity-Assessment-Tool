        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization has implemented multi-factor authentication (MFA) across critical access points including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, which is a strong security practice. An employee acceptable use policy is also in place, and new employees receive initial security awareness training. However, the organization lacks a program for annual security awareness training for all employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The absence of mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees significantly increases the organization's susceptibility to human-factor risks. Without regular updates and reinforcement, employees may become less vigilant against evolving threats such as sophisticated phishing attacks, social engineering tactics, and malware. This oversight can lead to accidental data breaches, credential compromise, and non-compliance with security policies, ultimately impacting data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating no annual training program.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>It is strongly recommended that the organization implement a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees. This training should cover current threat landscapes, best practices for data handling, phishing identification, social engineering awareness, and adherence to the acceptable use policy. Regular training will reinforce security principles, reduce human error, and foster a stronger security culture within the organization. Additionally, consider periodic simulated phishing exercises to test employee vigilance and identify areas for further training.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has established a commendable baseline with multi-factor authentication for key systems and initial security training for new hires, a critical gap exists in ongoing security awareness. The lack of annual security awareness training for all employees poses a significant risk, potentially undermining other security controls. Addressing this vulnerability through a comprehensive and recurring training program is essential to enhance the overall security posture and readiness against evolving cyber threats.</p>
