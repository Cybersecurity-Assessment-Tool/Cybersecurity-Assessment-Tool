        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates strong adherence to multi-factor authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, indicating a good baseline for access control. However, a critical vulnerability was identified on the network with an open port 8080 hosting a service titled 'TOP SECRET DB', suggesting a significant exposure. Furthermore, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees, which are crucial gaps in its security posture.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unsecured 'TOP SECRET DB' on Port 8080 - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open port 8080 was identified on the network, hosting a service explicitly titled 'TOP SECRET DB'. This indicates a potentially critical exposure of sensitive data or systems to the network, likely without adequate authentication or access controls. This finding contradicts any previous assessment claiming this port is secured and represents a severe risk of unauthorized data access or system compromise.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li><li>TOP SECRET DB service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This absence creates a significant governance gap, potentially leading to employees engaging in activities that pose security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive data, without clear guidelines or consequences. This increases the risk of data breaches, malware infections, and legal liabilities.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual training for all employees. This leaves the workforce vulnerable to evolving cyber threats, as security knowledge can degrade over time and new attack vectors emerge. Employees may fall victim to phishing, social engineering, or other attacks due to a lack of up-to-date awareness, significantly increasing the likelihood of security incidents.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Email systems</li><li>Network access</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediate action is required to address the critical exposure on port 8080; the 'TOP SECRET DB' service should be secured, removed, or placed behind robust access controls and firewalls. It is strongly recommended to conduct a thorough investigation into the nature and contents of this database. Furthermore, the organization must develop and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to establish clear guidelines for technology usage and data handling. Regular, mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees should be introduced to ensure the workforce remains vigilant against evolving cyber threats and understands their role in maintaining security.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a strong foundation in access control through its consistent use of MFA. However, the presence of an exposed 'TOP SECRET DB' on port 8080 represents a critical and immediate security risk that demands urgent attention. Coupled with the absence of an acceptable use policy and insufficient annual security awareness training, the organization faces significant vulnerabilities related to both external threats and internal human factors. Addressing these identified gaps is paramount to enhancing the overall cybersecurity posture and readiness.</p>
