        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's current security posture indicates significant gaps in foundational security controls, primarily concerning multi-factor authentication (MFA) and employee security awareness. While some initial security training is provided to new hires, there is a lack of ongoing, comprehensive training for all employees. Critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, are not protected by MFA, leaving the organization highly vulnerable to credential-based attacks. Furthermore, the absence of an employee acceptable use policy suggests a lack of formal guidelines for secure employee behavior, increasing the risk of insider threats and accidental data exposure. The broken network scan data prevents a detailed assessment of network-specific vulnerabilities, but the organizational data alone points to a low level of readiness against common cyber threats.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for email access. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. Compromised email accounts can lead to further internal system breaches, data exfiltration, and business email compromise (BEC) scams. This vulnerability was identified directly from the 'Org Data'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee email accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for logging into computers. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or guessed. A compromised computer can provide an attacker with network access, privilege escalation opportunities, and access to local data. This vulnerability was identified directly from the 'Org Data'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee workstations/laptops</li><li>Network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA to access sensitive data systems. This is a critical vulnerability as it means that a single compromised password could grant an attacker direct access to the organization's most valuable and confidential information. The impact could include data breaches, regulatory fines, reputational damage, and loss of intellectual property. This vulnerability was identified directly from the 'Org Data'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>File shares</li><li>Cloud storage</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines, employees may engage in activities that inadvertently introduce security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling company data. This increases the likelihood of malware infections, data leakage, and non-compliance with security best practices. This vulnerability was identified directly from the 'Org Data'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>IT systems</li><li>Data handling procedures</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual training for all employees. This means that existing employees may not be updated on the latest threats, best practices, or changes in company policy. Over time, their awareness can degrade, making them more susceptible to social engineering attacks (phishing, vishing), malware, and other human-factor vulnerabilities. This vulnerability was identified directly from the 'Org Data'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, immediate implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is strongly recommended for all critical access points, including email systems, computer logins, and especially sensitive data systems. This will provide a crucial layer of defense against credential theft. Concurrently, a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy should be developed and enforced to establish clear guidelines for secure behavior and data handling. Furthermore, the organization must implement a robust, annual security awareness training program for all employees, not just new hires, to ensure continuous education on evolving cyber threats and best practices. Regular training will empower employees to recognize and report suspicious activities, reducing the human element as a primary attack vector.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently exhibits a low level of cybersecurity readiness due to critical gaps in fundamental security controls. The absence of MFA across key access points and the lack of comprehensive, ongoing security awareness training for all employees expose the organization to a high risk of data breaches, unauthorized access, and operational disruption. While specific network vulnerabilities could not be assessed due to broken scan data, the identified organizational weaknesses alone present a significant attack surface. Addressing these vulnerabilities through the recommended actions is paramount to establishing a more resilient and secure environment.</p>
