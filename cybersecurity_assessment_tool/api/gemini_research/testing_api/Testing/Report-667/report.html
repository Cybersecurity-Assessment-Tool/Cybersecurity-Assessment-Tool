        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan identified an open SSH port (22), which, if not properly secured, can be a significant entry point for attackers. On the organizational front, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is commendably implemented for email access, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, indicating a strong technical control posture. However, a critical gap exists in the human element of security, as the organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or annual training for all employees. This lack of training significantly increases the risk of social engineering attacks and human error, potentially undermining the effectiveness of technical controls.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed SSH Service - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH port (22) was detected during the network scan. While SSH is a necessary service for remote administration, an improperly secured SSH service can be vulnerable to brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or exploitation of known vulnerabilities in the SSH daemon. A successful compromise of this service could grant unauthorized remote access to the underlying system, leading to data exfiltration, system compromise, or further lateral movement within the network. The impact could range from unauthorized access to complete system control.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 22</li><li>SSH service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks a formal security awareness training program for both new hires and existing employees. This absence leaves employees susceptible to a wide range of social engineering attacks, including phishing, pretexting, and malware delivery via malicious links or attachments. Without proper training, employees may inadvertently expose sensitive information, fall victim to credential theft, or introduce malware into the network, making them the weakest link in the security chain. Human error is a leading cause of security incidents, and this vulnerability significantly increases the risk of a successful breach.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement robust security measures for the exposed SSH service. This includes disabling password authentication in favor of key-based authentication, disabling root login, configuring strong, unique passphrases for SSH keys, implementing IP-based access restrictions or a VPN for SSH access, and deploying a tool like Fail2Ban to counter brute-force attempts. Additionally, establishing a comprehensive security awareness training program is crucial. This program should include mandatory training for all new hires, covering common threats, organizational policies, and best practices, along with annual refresher training for all employees, incorporating current threat landscapes and simulated phishing exercises to reinforce learning and test preparedness.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization has made commendable strides in implementing Multi-Factor Authentication across critical access points, demonstrating a strong commitment to technical security controls. However, the presence of an open SSH port, coupled with a complete absence of security awareness training, introduces significant attack vectors that could undermine these efforts. While technical controls are robust, the human element remains largely unprotected. Addressing these vulnerabilities, particularly by securing the SSH service and instituting a robust security awareness program, is paramount to enhancing the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and readiness against evolving threats.</p>
