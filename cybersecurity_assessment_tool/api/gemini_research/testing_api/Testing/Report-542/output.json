                "Summary": "The organization's network currently presents several critical security vulnerabilities. An Nmap scan revealed an open FTP service (vsftpd 2.3.4) allowing anonymous login, which poses a significant risk for unauthorized access and data exposure. Furthermore, internal data indicates that while Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is used for email and computer logins, it is not enforced for sensitive data systems, leaving critical information vulnerable. A substantial portion of workstations are running Windows 7, an end-of-life operating system, which is highly susceptible to unpatched exploits. Additionally, the organization lacks comprehensive security awareness training for both new and existing employees, increasing the human risk factor for social engineering attacks.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Anonymous FTP Access",
                        "Overview": "The Nmap scan identified an open FTP service (vsftpd 2.3.4) on port 21 that allows anonymous login. This configuration can lead to unauthorized access to files, data leakage, or even server compromise if write permissions are enabled or if sensitive information is stored in publicly accessible directories. The outdated version of vsftpd (2.3.4) also has known vulnerabilities.",

                        "Risk": "Outdated Windows Policy",
                        "Overview": "Computers are running Windows 7, which is an end-of-life operating system and no longer receives security updates from Microsoft. This makes these workstations highly vulnerable to known exploits and malware, posing a significant risk to the entire network's integrity and data confidentiality.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Workstations running Windows 7"

                    {
                        "Risk": "Insufficient Multi-Factor Authentication",
                        "Overview": "While MFA is implemented for email and computer logins, it is not required for accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if credentials are compromised through phishing, keylogging, or other means, as a single factor of authentication is insufficient to protect high-value assets.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                    {
                        "Risk": "Inadequate Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or annually for all employees. This leaves employees susceptible to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) and makes them less likely to follow best security practices, increasing the overall human risk factor and the likelihood of successful cyberattacks.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "Organizational security posture"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately disable anonymous FTP access on the vsftpd server. If FTP functionality is essential, implement secure alternatives like SFTP or FTPS with strong authentication and encryption, restricting access to authorized users only. All workstations running Windows 7 must be upgraded to a currently supported operating system, such as Windows 10 or 11, to ensure they receive critical security updates. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) should be extended to cover all sensitive data systems to provide an additional layer of security against credential compromise. Finally, establish and regularly conduct mandatory security awareness training for all new employees and annually for all existing employees to educate them on common cyber threats and best security practices, thereby strengthening the human firewall.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces several significant cybersecurity vulnerabilities, including an insecure FTP service, widespread use of an end-of-life operating system, critical gaps in MFA coverage for sensitive data, and a complete lack of security awareness training. These issues collectively expose the organization to a high risk of data breaches, unauthorized access, and operational disruption. Addressing these vulnerabilities through the recommended actions is crucial for improving the overall security posture and readiness against evolving cyber threats."
