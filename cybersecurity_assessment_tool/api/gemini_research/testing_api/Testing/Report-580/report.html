        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The network scan data indicates no open ports were identified, suggesting a potentially well-hardened external perimeter or that the scan was limited in scope. The organization generally demonstrates good security practices regarding Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems, and maintains an acceptable use policy along with regular security awareness training for employees. However, a notable gap exists in the absence of MFA for computer logins.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised through phishing, keylogging, or brute-force attacks. Without a second factor, a malicious actor only needs a username and password to gain access to an employee's workstation and potentially the internal network, leading to potential data breaches, system compromise, or lateral movement within the network. This vulnerability was identified through the provided organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Internal network access points</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>It is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins across the organization. This should apply to all employee workstations and any relevant servers or systems where user authentication is performed. Additionally, while current security awareness training is in place, it should be reinforced with specific modules on the importance of MFA and how to report suspicious login attempts. Regular security audits and penetration testing should be conducted to identify and address any other potential vulnerabilities.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization has established a commendable security posture in several areas, including MFA for email and sensitive data, and a robust security awareness program. However, the absence of MFA for computer logins represents a significant vulnerability that could be exploited to gain initial access to the internal network. Addressing this critical gap by implementing MFA for computer logins is paramount to enhancing the overall security posture and readiness against common attack vectors, thereby significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access and potential breaches.</p>
