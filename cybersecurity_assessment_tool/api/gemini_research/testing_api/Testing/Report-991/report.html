        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The network scan identified one active host with port 22 (SSH) open, indicating a potential entry point for remote access. The organization's security posture regarding user authentication shows a mix of strengths and weaknesses. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is used for computer logins and security awareness training is conducted regularly, critical areas like email and sensitive data systems currently lack MFA protection.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks. Compromised email accounts can lead to further internal network breaches, data exfiltration, and business email compromise (BEC) scams. This vulnerability was identified from the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on email.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li><li>Organizational data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA to access sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are compromised. Attackers gaining access to these systems could exfiltrate sensitive information, disrupt operations, or introduce malware. This vulnerability was identified from the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on sensitive data systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Critical business data</li><li>User accounts with access to sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port (22) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The network scan identified an open SSH port (22) on an active host. While SSH is a legitimate service for secure remote access, an open port presents a potential attack surface. If not properly secured with strong authentication (e.g., key-based authentication, MFA) and robust access controls, it can be vulnerable to brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or exploitation of SSH daemon vulnerabilities, leading to unauthorized remote access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with open port 22</li><li>Network perimeter</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and sensitive data systems immediately. This critical step will drastically reduce the risk of unauthorized access even if primary credentials are compromised. Furthermore, a thorough review of the SSH service configuration on the identified host is advised. Ensure strong authentication mechanisms, such as SSH keys, are enforced, password authentication is disabled or uses very strong, regularly rotated passwords, and access is restricted to only necessary IP addresses or networks via firewall rules. Regular patching and updates for the SSH daemon are also crucial.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant security risks due to the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for email and sensitive data systems, which are critical entry points and data repositories. While the organization demonstrates good practices in security awareness training and acceptable use policies, these foundational authentication weaknesses leave it highly susceptible to credential-based attacks and subsequent data breaches. The open SSH port also presents a potential vector for unauthorized access if not adequately secured. Addressing these vulnerabilities, particularly the MFA gaps, is paramount to improving the overall cybersecurity readiness and protecting valuable assets.</p>
