        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and computer logins, and conducts regular security awareness training for all employees, including new hires. However, there are gaps in security posture related to MFA for sensitive data systems and the absence of an employee acceptable use policy. No network-level technical vulnerabilities were identified from the provided scan data.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if credentials are compromised through phishing, malware, or other means. Without MFA, a single compromised password can lead to a data breach. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This means there are no formal guidelines defining appropriate and inappropriate use of company IT resources, data, and networks. This can lead to inconsistent employee behavior, increased risk of data leakage, misuse of company assets, and potential legal liabilities. Without clear policies, employees may inadvertently or intentionally engage in risky activities. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Data</li><li>Networks</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems. This will add a crucial layer of security, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access even if primary credentials are compromised. Additionally, the organization should develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy. This policy should clearly outline the proper use of company IT assets, data handling procedures, and expected employee conduct, ensuring consistent security practices across the workforce. Regular communication and training on this policy will be essential for its effectiveness.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization demonstrates good practices in implementing MFA for email and computer logins, and maintaining regular security awareness training, critical vulnerabilities exist concerning the protection of sensitive data systems and the absence of foundational policy documentation. The lack of MFA for sensitive data systems presents a high risk of data compromise, and the absence of an acceptable use policy leaves the organization exposed to various operational and security risks due to undefined employee conduct. Addressing these gaps is crucial for improving overall readiness and mitigating potential security incidents.</p>
