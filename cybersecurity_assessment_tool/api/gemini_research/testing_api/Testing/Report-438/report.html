        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan indicates a host is operational, though specific port details show port 80 as closed in the provided scan data. However, a critical vulnerability assessment highlights an unencrypted web server on port 80. A significant area of concern is the widespread lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. While an acceptable use policy is in place and annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees, there is a gap in providing security awareness training for new employees upon onboarding.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unencrypted Web Server - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An unencrypted web server was identified, with port 80 being open. This exposes any data transmitted over this port to potential interception and eavesdropping, compromising data confidentiality. The risk was identified through a vulnerability assessment.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA to access email. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or other means. A single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to sensitive communications and potentially lead to further breaches. This was identified via organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MFA is not required for logging into computers within the organization. This vulnerability allows an attacker with compromised credentials to gain unauthorized access to internal workstations and the network. This could lead to data exfiltration, malware deployment, or lateral movement within the network. This was identified via organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations</li><li>User accounts</li><li>Internal network</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Access to sensitive data systems does not require MFA. This is a critical vulnerability, as it leaves the organization's most valuable and confidential data susceptible to unauthorized access if a single set of credentials is breached. The impact could include severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and significant reputational damage. This was identified via organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training upon onboarding. This means new hires are immediately exposed to potential cyber threats (e.g., phishing, social engineering) without the necessary knowledge to identify and mitigate them, making them a potential weak link in the organization's security posture from day one. This was identified via organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, immediate implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is strongly recommended across all critical access points, including email systems, computer logins, and especially sensitive data systems. For the identified unencrypted web server, it is crucial to either secure port 80 with SSL/TLS encryption if it is intended for web traffic, or close it if it is not in use. Furthermore, the organization should establish and enforce mandatory security awareness training for all new employees as part of their onboarding process, ensuring they are equipped with essential cybersecurity knowledge from day one. While annual training is commendable, addressing the initial training gap is vital. Regular reviews of network configurations and security policies are also advised to ensure ongoing compliance and protection against evolving threats.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to the pervasive lack of Multi-Factor Authentication across key access points, which leaves critical systems and sensitive data highly vulnerable to credential-based attacks. While an acceptable use policy and annual security awareness training are positive steps, the absence of initial security training for new employees creates an immediate vulnerability. The identified unencrypted web server also poses a risk to data confidentiality. Addressing these critical vulnerabilities, particularly through the widespread adoption of MFA and comprehensive new employee training, is paramount to improving the organization's overall security readiness and protecting its assets from potential cyber threats.</p>
