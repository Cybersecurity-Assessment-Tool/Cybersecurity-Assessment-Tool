        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and sensitive data systems, and maintaining an acceptable use policy. Annual security awareness training is also in place for all employees. However, critical gaps exist in email security, specifically the absence of MFA for email access, and a lack of dedicated security awareness training for new employees. These areas represent significant vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Email Security - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. Compromised email accounts can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and further network penetration. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email accounts</li><li>Email server/service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>New Employee Security Training Gap - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees upon onboarding. While annual training is provided, new hires are vulnerable to social engineering attacks, phishing, and poor security practices during their initial period, potentially before receiving comprehensive training. This increases the risk of human error leading to security incidents. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access. This crucial step will significantly enhance protection against credential theft and unauthorized access to email accounts. Furthermore, a comprehensive security awareness training program must be established for all new employees as part of their onboarding process. This training should cover common threats like phishing, social engineering, and best practices for data handling, ensuring new hires are equipped with essential security knowledge from day one. Regular reinforcement of these principles through ongoing training is also advised.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently exhibits a mixed state of cybersecurity readiness. While some key security controls like MFA for critical systems and annual training are present, the absence of MFA for email and the lack of initial security awareness training for new employees pose considerable risks. Addressing these specific vulnerabilities is paramount to strengthening the organization's overall security posture and reducing its susceptibility to common cyber threats.</p>
