        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's external network perimeter appears to be well-secured, with no open ports detected during the Nmap scan. Strong multi-factor authentication (MFA) is implemented for accessing email, logging into computers, and accessing sensitive data systems, which significantly enhances identity and access management. However, internal policy and training aspects reveal notable gaps, including the absence of an employee acceptable use policy and a lack of dedicated security awareness training for new employees, although annual training is conducted for all existing employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy (AUP). An AUP is critical for defining the proper and acceptable use of company IT resources, including networks, systems, and data. Without clear guidelines, employees may inadvertently or intentionally engage in activities that could compromise security, lead to data breaches, or expose the organization to legal and compliance risks. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational IT assets</li><li>Company data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not provide specific security awareness training for new employees during their onboarding process. New hires, often unfamiliar with the company's specific security protocols, common threat vectors, and reporting procedures, represent a significant vulnerability. This increases the risk of successful social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) targeting new staff, which could lead to unauthorized access, data compromise, or malware infections. This gap was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational IT systems</li><li>Company data</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization develop and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy (AUP). This AUP should clearly outline expectations for the use of company resources, data handling, and security best practices, and be communicated to all employees. Furthermore, mandatory security awareness training should be integrated into the onboarding process for all new employees to ensure they are equipped with essential security knowledge from day one. Continuing the annual security awareness training for all employees is also crucial to maintain a strong security culture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a commendable commitment to technical security controls, particularly with widespread MFA implementation and a well-secured external network perimeter. However, the absence of an acceptable use policy and dedicated security awareness training for new employees represents significant non-technical vulnerabilities. Addressing these policy and training gaps is essential to strengthen the overall security posture, reduce human-factor risks, and ensure a more resilient defense against evolving cyber threats.</p>
