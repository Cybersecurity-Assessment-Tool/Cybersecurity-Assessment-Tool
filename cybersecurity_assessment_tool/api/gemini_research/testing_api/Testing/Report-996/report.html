        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's current cybersecurity posture indicates several critical weaknesses primarily related to identity and access management and employee security awareness. While an acceptable use policy is in place and MFA is used for computer logins, there is a significant lack of multi-factor authentication for email and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or provide annual training for all staff, leaving the human element as a substantial vulnerability. The absence of network scan data and specific vulnerability reports due to broken input limits a comprehensive technical assessment, but the organizational data alone points to fundamental security gaps.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee inboxes if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. Email often contains sensitive information and can be used as a pivot point for further attacks, leading to data breaches or business email compromise.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email accounts</li><li>User credentials</li><li>Organizational communication</li><li>Potential data exfiltration</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are stolen or guessed. Compromise of these systems could lead to severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, significant financial penalties, and severe reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases containing confidential information</li><li>Customer data</li><li>Proprietary business data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees are not provided with security awareness training upon onboarding. This means they may not be aware of common cybersecurity threats (e.g., phishing, social engineering, malware) or organizational security policies from the start. This increases the likelihood of new hires inadvertently introducing vulnerabilities or falling victim to attacks, potentially compromising the organization's security from day one.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>Organizational network</li><li>Data integrity</li><li>Overall security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Annual Security Awareness Training for All Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. Without regular training, employees may forget best practices, fail to recognize evolving threats, or become complacent. This leads to a higher risk of human error contributing to security incidents, such as clicking malicious links, opening infected attachments, or mishandling sensitive information, thereby weakening the organization's defense against sophisticated attacks.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational network</li><li>Data security</li><li>Incident response effectiveness</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, the organization should immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and sensitive data systems. This is a critical step to protect against credential theft and unauthorized access. Concurrently, a comprehensive security awareness training program must be established. This program should include mandatory training for all new employees during onboarding and annual refresher training for all existing staff. Training should cover topics such as phishing recognition, social engineering tactics, password hygiene, and data handling best practices. Regular training will empower employees to become a strong line of defense against cyber threats.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity vulnerabilities, primarily stemming from inadequate identity and access management controls for critical systems and a lack of robust security awareness training for its workforce. While some foundational policies are in place, the absence of MFA for email and sensitive data, coupled with no regular security education, leaves the organization highly susceptible to common and impactful cyberattacks. Addressing these fundamental gaps is paramount to improving the overall security posture and readiness against evolving threats.</p>
