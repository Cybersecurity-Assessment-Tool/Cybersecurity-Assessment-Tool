        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes a MySQL database (version 5.7.33) on port 3306. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is mandated for computer logins and sensitive data systems, it is notably absent for email access. The organization has an acceptable use policy and conducts annual security awareness training for all employees, but new employees do not receive initial security training upon onboarding.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network, potentially exposing the database to unauthorized access if not properly secured at the application layer. This was identified via network scanning.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li><li>MySQL Database Server</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing or brute-force attacks, as a single compromised password could grant an attacker access to sensitive communications and potentially other systems. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email accounts</li><li>Email infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate New Employee Security Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training upon joining the organization. This leaves them vulnerable to common social engineering tactics and unaware of organizational security policies and best practices from the outset, increasing the risk of human error leading to security incidents. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted internal IP addresses or via a secure VPN. Furthermore, mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) should be enforced for all email accounts to significantly reduce the risk of account compromise. The organization should also establish a comprehensive security awareness training program for all new hires as part of their onboarding process, ensuring they are equipped with essential security knowledge from day one. Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments should be conducted to maintain a robust security posture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security with MFA for sensitive systems and annual security training. However, critical vulnerabilities exist, including an exposed MySQL database and the absence of MFA for email, which pose significant risks of data breach and account compromise. The lack of initial security training for new employees also presents a potential entry point for social engineering attacks. Addressing these identified weaknesses is crucial for enhancing the overall cybersecurity readiness and protecting organizational assets.</p>
