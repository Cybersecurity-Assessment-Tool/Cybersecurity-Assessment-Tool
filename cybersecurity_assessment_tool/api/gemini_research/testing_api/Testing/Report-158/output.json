                "Summary": "The organization's network currently exhibits several critical security vulnerabilities and policy gaps. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for email and computer logins, it is notably absent for sensitive data systems. Furthermore, there is a lack of a formal employee acceptable use policy and no dedicated security awareness training for new employees, leaving the organization susceptible to human-factor risks. Network scans revealed an active FTP service allowing anonymous access, posing a significant data leakage or unauthorized access risk. Additionally, workstations are running an outdated operating system (Windows 7), which is no longer supported and highly vulnerable to exploits.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Outdated Windows Policy",
                        "Overview": "Computers are running Windows 7. This operating system is end-of-life and no longer receives security updates, making systems highly vulnerable to known and newly discovered exploits. The impact includes potential system compromise, data loss, and regulatory non-compliance. This was identified through a review of current system configurations.",

                        "Risk": "Anonymous FTP Access",
                        "Overview": "The FTP service (vsftpd 2.3.4) on port 21 allows anonymous login. This configuration can lead to unauthorized access to files, data leakage, or even arbitrary file uploads if not properly secured, potentially compromising the integrity and confidentiality of data. This was identified via an Nmap scan using the 'ftp-anon' script.",

                        "Risk": "No MFA for Sensitive Data Systems",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical data if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or other means. A single compromised password could grant an attacker full access. This was identified through a review of organizational security policies.",

                        "Risk": "No Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)",
                        "Overview": "The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines, employees may engage in activities that introduce security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling company data. This increases the likelihood of malware infections, data breaches, and legal liabilities. This was identified through a review of organizational policies.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "No Security Awareness Training for New Employees",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) due to their unfamiliarity with organizational security protocols and common threats. This oversight leaves the organization vulnerable to human-factor exploits from the moment an employee joins. This was identified through a review of organizational training programs.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "New employees",
                            "Organizational security posture"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately upgrade all workstations running Windows 7 to a currently supported operating system like Windows 10 or 11. For the FTP service, anonymous access should be disabled, and access should be restricted to authenticated users with strong password policies and, ideally, secure protocols like SFTP or FTPS. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to significantly enhance access security. Develop and enforce a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) to clearly define expected employee behavior regarding IT resources. Furthermore, establish and implement mandatory security awareness training for all new employees, in addition to the existing annual training, to ensure a consistent baseline of security knowledge across the organization.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization faces significant security challenges stemming from outdated systems, insecure network services, and critical policy gaps. While some security measures like MFA for email and computer logins are in place, the absence of MFA for sensitive data, lack of an AUP, and insufficient new employee training create substantial vulnerabilities. Addressing these issues proactively is crucial to enhance the overall security posture, protect sensitive data, and reduce the risk of successful cyberattacks."
