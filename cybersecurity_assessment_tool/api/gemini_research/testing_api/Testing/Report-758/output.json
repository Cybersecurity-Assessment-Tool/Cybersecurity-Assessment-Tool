            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security awareness training and acceptable use policies, with both new and existing employees receiving annual training. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for email and computer logins, which is a positive step. However, a critical gap exists as MFA is not required for accessing sensitive data systems. Network scanning revealed an active FTP service with anonymous login enabled, posing a significant data exposure risk. Furthermore, the presence of outdated operating systems (Windows 7) on workstations introduces substantial unpatched vulnerabilities.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Anonymous FTP Access",
                        "Overview": "An Nmap scan identified an open FTP service (vsftpd 2.3.4) on port 21, configured to allow anonymous login. This configuration permits unauthorized users to access and potentially modify files on the FTP server without requiring any credentials, leading to potential data breaches, unauthorized data manipulation, or even system compromise if sensitive information is stored or writable directories are exposed.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "FTP Server (vsftpd 2.3.4)",
                            "Port 21"

                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly elevates the risk of unauthorized access to critical and confidential data. If user credentials for these systems are compromised through phishing, credential stuffing, or other attack vectors, a single password breach could grant full access to sensitive information without an additional layer of security.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Sensitive Data Systems",

                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Outdated Operating System (Windows 7)",
                        "Overview": "Several workstations within the organization are running Windows 7. This operating system has reached its end-of-life for mainstream support and security updates, meaning Microsoft no longer provides patches for newly discovered vulnerabilities. This exposes these systems to a multitude of known and unpatched security flaws, making them highly susceptible to malware infections, exploits, and other cyberattacks that could compromise the entire network.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Workstations running Windows 7"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately disable anonymous FTP access and ensure all FTP services are properly secured with strong authentication and access controls. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to significantly enhance protection against unauthorized access. Furthermore, prioritize the upgrade of all workstations running Windows 7 to a currently supported operating system, such as Windows 10 or 11, to ensure they receive critical security updates and patches. Conduct a comprehensive inventory of all network services to identify and secure any other potentially exposed or misconfigured services.",
            "Conclusion": "While the organization has established good practices in security awareness training and MFA for general access, critical vulnerabilities exist that significantly impact its overall security posture. The presence of anonymous FTP access, the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems, and the continued use of outdated operating systems represent high-priority risks that could lead to data breaches, system compromise, and operational disruption. Addressing these issues is paramount to improving the organization's cybersecurity readiness and protecting its assets."
