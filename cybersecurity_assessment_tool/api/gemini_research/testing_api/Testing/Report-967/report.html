        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems and conducts regular security awareness training for all employees. However, a critical security gap exists as MFA is not required for computer logins, significantly increasing the risk of unauthorized access. Additionally, the absence of an employee acceptable use policy leaves the organization vulnerable to misuse of resources and potential data breaches. Network scans also identified an open SSH port, which, if not securely configured, presents a potential entry point for attackers.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised through phishing, malware, or brute-force attacks. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's workstation and potentially the internal network, leading to data breaches, system compromise, and operational disruption. This vulnerability was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers/workstations</li><li>Internal network resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. An AUP defines the proper use of company assets, networks, and data, setting clear expectations for employee behavior regarding cybersecurity best practices. Without a formal policy, there's an increased risk of misuse of company resources, data breaches due to inappropriate employee actions, and potential legal or compliance issues, as employees may not be fully aware of their responsibilities. This vulnerability was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network resources</li><li>Company assets</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port (Port 22) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH (port 22) service was detected on a host within the network. While SSH is essential for secure remote administration, if not properly secured (e.g., strong passwords, key-based authentication, disabled root login, rate limiting, regular patching), it can be a target for brute-force attacks or exploitation of known vulnerabilities. Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized remote access, command execution, and potential lateral movement within the network. This was identified via network scan data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with open port 22</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins across the organization to prevent unauthorized access from compromised credentials. A comprehensive employee acceptable use policy should be developed, communicated, and enforced to establish clear guidelines for the proper use of company assets and data, reducing the risk of internal misuse. Furthermore, the open SSH service should be thoroughly reviewed and secured by disabling password authentication in favor of key-based authentication, disabling root login, implementing IP whitelisting, and ensuring all SSH software is regularly patched and configured with strong security settings. The organization should continue its current security awareness training programs, potentially expanding them to cover the new AUP and the importance of MFA.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to cybersecurity through its use of MFA for sensitive systems and regular security awareness training. However, the absence of MFA for computer logins and a formal acceptable use policy represents significant vulnerabilities that could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and operational disruptions. The presence of an open SSH port also requires immediate attention to prevent potential exploitation. Addressing these critical gaps is paramount to enhancing the organization's overall cybersecurity posture, improving its readiness against modern threats, and ensuring the protection of its assets and data.</p>
