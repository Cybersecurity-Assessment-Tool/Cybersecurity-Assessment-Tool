        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The network scan identified at least one active host with an open SSH port (22). Organizational data reveals critical security gaps, primarily the complete absence of multi-factor authentication (MFA) for email access, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or annually for all employees, despite having an acceptable use policy in place. These findings indicate a low level of readiness against common cyber threats.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for critical access points, including email systems, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. This significantly elevates the risk of unauthorized access. If an attacker obtains a user's password through phishing, brute-force, or other means, they can gain full access to accounts and systems without an additional layer of verification. This vulnerability was identified through direct organizational policy inquiry.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email systems</li><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not provide security awareness training for new employees during onboarding, nor does it conduct annual refresher training for all employees. This leaves the workforce highly susceptible to social engineering attacks, such as phishing, malware distribution, and pretexting. Employees who are not trained on how to identify and report suspicious activities pose a significant human risk factor, potentially leading to data breaches or system compromises. This vulnerability was identified through direct organizational policy inquiry.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed SSH Port (22) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A network scan identified an open SSH port (22) on at least one host. While SSH is a legitimate service for remote administration, an exposed port without robust security controls (e.g., strong authentication, IP whitelisting, rate limiting, regular patching) is a common target for brute-force attacks and exploitation of known vulnerabilities. Given the lack of MFA across the organization, this port represents a potential entry point for attackers if weak credentials are in use or if the SSH server software is unpatched. This vulnerability was identified via network scanning.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host(s) with open port 22</li><li>Network perimeter</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly improve the organization's cybersecurity posture, immediate action is required. Firstly, implement and enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. This is the most effective measure to prevent unauthorized access from compromised credentials. Secondly, establish a comprehensive security awareness training program, including mandatory training for all new hires and annual refresher courses for all employees, focusing on phishing, social engineering, and secure computing practices. Thirdly, review and harden all systems with exposed SSH port 22 by enforcing strong, key-based authentication, disabling root login, implementing IP whitelisting, and ensuring regular patching of the SSH server software. Consider placing SSH behind a VPN or bastion host for external access. Finally, conduct regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing to proactively identify and remediate new security weaknesses.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces substantial cybersecurity risks primarily due to the complete absence of multi-factor authentication across critical systems and a significant lack of security awareness training for its workforce. The presence of an open SSH port further compounds these risks by providing a potential attack vector. While an acceptable use policy is in place, its effectiveness is severely limited without proper employee training. Addressing these fundamental security gaps is paramount to enhancing the organization's overall security posture and building resilience against prevalent cyber threats.</p>
