        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan identified an open SSH port (22) on a host. While the organization has positive security practices such as requiring MFA for computer logins, maintaining an employee acceptable use policy, and conducting security awareness training for new employees, critical gaps exist. Specifically, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for accessing email or sensitive data systems, and ongoing annual security awareness training for all employees is not performed.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for email access. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or stolen credentials. A compromised email account can lead to further attacks, data exfiltration, and business disruption. This vulnerability was identified from the organizational data indicating no MFA for email.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for accessing sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised. Unauthorized access to sensitive data can lead to data breaches, regulatory fines, reputational damage, and loss of customer trust. This vulnerability was identified from the organizational data indicating no MFA for sensitive data systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Ongoing Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. This can lead to a decline in security posture over time as employees may forget best practices, become complacent, or not be informed about new and evolving threats (e.g., new phishing techniques, social engineering tactics). A lack of regular training increases the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents. This vulnerability was identified from the organizational data indicating no annual training for all employees.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Overall organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port (Potential for Brute-Force/Exploitation) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH (port 22) was detected on a host during the network scan. While SSH is a legitimate service, an open port without proper security controls (e.g., strong passwords, key-based authentication, MFA, IP restrictions, regular patching) can be a target for brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or exploitation of unpatched vulnerabilities in the SSH daemon. This could lead to unauthorized remote access to the system. This vulnerability was identified from the network scan data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with open port 22</li><li>SSH service</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, the organization should immediately implement and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication for all email accounts and sensitive data systems. This is a critical step to protect against credential theft, phishing attacks, and unauthorized data access. Furthermore, a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees should be established to ensure ongoing vigilance against evolving cyber threats and to reinforce best practices. Finally, the SSH service on the host with open port 22 must be reviewed and hardened by enforcing strong authentication methods (preferably key-based), disabling root login, implementing IP-based access restrictions, and ensuring the SSH daemon is regularly patched and updated.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several significant security risks, primarily stemming from a lack of comprehensive Multi-Factor Authentication implementation for critical systems like email and sensitive data access, and an absence of regular, ongoing security awareness training for its entire workforce. The presence of an open SSH port also presents a potential entry point if not adequately secured. While some foundational security practices are in place, these identified vulnerabilities leave the organization susceptible to various cyber threats, including account compromise, data breaches, and unauthorized system access. Addressing these gaps is crucial for improving the overall security posture and readiness against evolving cyber threats.</p>
