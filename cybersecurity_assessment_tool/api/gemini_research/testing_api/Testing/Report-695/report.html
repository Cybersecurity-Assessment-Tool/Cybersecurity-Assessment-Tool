        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network assessment reveals a concerning security posture, characterized by several critical vulnerabilities and a significant lack of fundamental security controls. An Nmap scan identified an active host with an open SSH (port 22) service, which, without proper hardening, presents a direct attack vector. Furthermore, the organizational data indicates a complete absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for critical access points including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. The organization also lacks essential policy and training frameworks, specifically an employee acceptable use policy and any form of security awareness training for both new and existing employees. These deficiencies collectively expose the organization to a high risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and operational disruption.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A critical vulnerability where the localhost is exposed, potentially allowing unauthorized access or information disclosure. The specific impact depends on what services are running and accessible on the exposed localhost. This was identified from provided vulnerability data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unsecured SSH Port - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH (port 22) service was detected on an active host. Without proper security measures such as strong password policies, key-based authentication, and multi-factor authentication, this port can be a target for brute-force attacks or unauthorized access, leading to system compromise. This was identified via Nmap scan.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 22</li><li>Network perimeter</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks, as a single compromised password can grant full access to an employee's email, potentially leading to business email compromise and data leakage. This was identified from organizational policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if passwords are stolen or guessed, potentially leading to lateral movement within the network, malware propagation, and data breaches. This was identified from organizational policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations</li><li>Servers</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>

            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk, as unauthorized access to these systems could lead to severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, significant financial penalties, and severe reputational damage. This was identified from organizational policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>Cloud storage</li></ul>

            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines on the appropriate and secure use of company IT resources, employees may inadvertently or intentionally engage in risky behaviors, increasing the likelihood of security incidents, data leakage, and potential legal liabilities. This was identified from organizational policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>

            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not provide security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) due to their unfamiliarity with company policies and security best practices, significantly increasing the risk of initial compromise and insider threats. This was identified from organizational policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>

            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. Regular training is crucial to keep employees informed about evolving threats, reinforce best practices, and maintain a strong human firewall, preventing common attacks like phishing, malware, and social engineering. This was identified from organizational policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>

            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, immediate action is required across several fronts. Firstly, the 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability must be thoroughly investigated and remediated by restricting access and ensuring only necessary services are exposed. The open SSH port (22) should be secured by implementing strong password policies, enforcing key-based authentication, and ideally, requiring MFA for SSH access. Network firewalls should be configured to limit SSH access to trusted IP ranges only. Secondly, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be implemented universally for email access, computer logins, and all sensitive data systems to significantly reduce the risk of credential compromise. Thirdly, the organization must develop and enforce a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) to establish clear guidelines for IT resource usage. Finally, a robust security awareness training program should be established, including mandatory training for all new employees and annual refreshers for the entire workforce, to foster a security-conscious culture and empower employees to identify and report threats.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces a critical security posture with numerous high and critical vulnerabilities, primarily stemming from a lack of fundamental security controls and employee awareness programs. The absence of MFA across key access points, coupled with an open SSH port and no security training or policies, creates a highly exploitable environment. Without immediate and comprehensive remediation efforts, the organization remains highly susceptible to cyberattacks, data breaches, and significant operational and reputational damage. Prioritizing the implementation of MFA, securing network services, and establishing robust security policies and training are paramount to improving the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness.</p>
