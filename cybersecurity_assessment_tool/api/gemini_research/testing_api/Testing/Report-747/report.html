        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes a MySQL database (version 5.7.33) on port 3306. While strong multi-factor authentication (MFA) is implemented for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, there are significant gaps in human-centric security controls. Specifically, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct security awareness training for either new or existing employees annually.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network, potentially allowing unauthorized access to the database. This was identified via network scanning, showing an open port with an identified MySQL service.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li><li>MySQL Database Server</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not have an employee acceptable use policy. This absence leaves employees without clear guidelines on appropriate technology usage, increasing the risk of misuse, data breaches, and non-compliance. This was identified through a review of organizational policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data and systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or annually for all employees. This significantly increases the risk of successful phishing attacks, social engineering, and other human-factor vulnerabilities, as employees may not recognize or report threats. This was identified through a review of organizational training programs.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data and systems</li><li>Email systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted internal IP addresses or specific application servers. For long-term security, consider placing the database behind a VPN or implementing a more robust access control mechanism. Furthermore, the organization must develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to guide appropriate technology behavior. Crucially, a mandatory security awareness training program should be established for all new hires and conducted annually for all existing employees to bolster the human firewall against social engineering and other common threats.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In conclusion, while the organization has a strong foundation with multi-factor authentication across critical access points, it faces immediate risks from an exposed MySQL database. More critically, the absence of an employee acceptable use policy and a consistent security awareness training program for all employees represents a significant vulnerability, leaving the organization susceptible to human-factor exploits and internal misuse. Addressing these policy and training gaps is as crucial as resolving technical vulnerabilities to achieve a robust security posture.</p>
