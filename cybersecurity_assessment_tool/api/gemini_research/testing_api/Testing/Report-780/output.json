            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization currently lacks multi-factor authentication (MFA) for email access and computer logins, and does not conduct regular security awareness training for new or existing employees. While an acceptable use policy is in place and MFA is used for sensitive data systems, these gaps significantly increase the risk of unauthorized access and social engineering attacks, leaving the organization vulnerable to credential theft and human-error related incidents.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Email Access",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. A compromised email account can lead to further internal system breaches, data exfiltration, and business email compromise (BEC) scams. This was identified through the organizational data provided.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Computer Logins",
                        "Overview": "Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for logging into computers within the organization. This leaves computer systems vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials (username/password) are compromised. Attackers could gain access to internal networks, sensitive data, and critical systems, leading to data breaches, system disruption, or ransomware attacks. This was identified through the organizational data provided.",
                        "Severity": "High",

                    {
                        "Risk": "No Security Awareness Training for New Employees",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not provide security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) due to their unfamiliarity with organizational security policies and common threats. This lack of training increases the likelihood of successful social engineering attacks, leading to credential theft, malware infections, or accidental data disclosure. This was identified through the organizational data provided.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",

                        "Risk": "No Annual Security Awareness Training for All Employees",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. Regular training is crucial to keep employees informed about evolving cyber threats, reinforce security best practices, and maintain a strong security posture. Without annual training, employees may become complacent or unaware of new attack vectors, increasing the risk of human error leading to security incidents. This was identified through the organizational data provided.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "Organizational data",
                            "Overall security posture"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and computer logins immediately. This critical step will significantly enhance protection against credential-based attacks. Furthermore, a comprehensive security awareness training program should be established. This program must include mandatory training for all new employees upon onboarding and annual refresher training for all existing employees. Training should cover topics such as phishing identification, password hygiene, data handling best practices, and incident reporting procedures. Regularly updating and enforcing these security measures will strengthen the organization's overall cybersecurity posture.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for email and computer access, and a complete lack of security awareness training for both new and existing employees. While MFA is utilized for sensitive data systems and and an acceptable use policy is in place, these positives are overshadowed by critical gaps in foundational security controls. Addressing these vulnerabilities through the immediate implementation of MFA and a robust, ongoing security awareness training program is essential to improve the organization's readiness against common cyber threats and prevent potential data breaches or system compromises."
