            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization operates a web server running Nginx version 1.18.0 on port 443 (HTTPS). While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for email and computer logins, it is notably absent for access to sensitive data systems. The organization has an acceptable use policy and conducts annual security awareness training for all employees, but lacks specific security awareness training for new hires.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Outdated Web Server Software",
                        "Overview": "The Nginx web server (version 1.18.0) identified on port 443 is an older stable release. Running outdated software can expose the organization to known vulnerabilities that have been patched in newer versions. Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access, disrupt services, or compromise data. This was identified via network port scanning.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Nginx web server (version 1.18.0) on port 443"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Sensitive Data Systems",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication. This was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Sensitive data systems access"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Inadequate Security Awareness Training for New Employees",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct security awareness training specifically for new employees. This leaves new hires potentially unaware of critical security policies, common threats (e.g., phishing, social engineering), and best practices, increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents. This was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "New employees",
                            "Overall organizational security posture"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "It is strongly recommended to update the Nginx web server to the latest stable version to mitigate known vulnerabilities and ensure ongoing security. Implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems is crucial to enhance access security and protect against credential compromise. Furthermore, establishing a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees upon onboarding will ensure they are equipped with essential security knowledge from day one, reducing the risk of human-factor incidents.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization demonstrates a foundational security posture with MFA for general logins and annual security training. However, critical gaps exist, particularly with an outdated web server, the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems, and a lack of initial security training for new employees. Addressing these vulnerabilities is essential to significantly improve the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and reduce its attack surface."
