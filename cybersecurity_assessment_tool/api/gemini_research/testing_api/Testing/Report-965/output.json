            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network currently exposes Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) port 3389, which is a significant security concern. Internally, while Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is used for email access, it is not enforced for computer logins or sensitive data systems, creating substantial authentication weaknesses. The organization maintains an acceptable use policy and conducts annual security awareness training for all employees; however, new employees do not receive initial security awareness training, leaving a gap in their foundational security knowledge.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "RDP Exposure",
                        "Overview": "Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) port 3389 was found open and accessible. This exposes the system to potential brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, and unauthorized access, especially if strong authentication mechanisms are not in place. This was identified via network port scanning.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Computer Logins",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication. This was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employee workstations and servers requiring login"
                        ]

                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems",
                        "Overview": "Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if user credentials are compromised, potentially leading to data breaches and compliance violations. This was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All sensitive data systems and databases"
                        ]

                    {
                        "Risk": "Missing New Employee Security Training",
                        "Overview": "While annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees, new employees do not receive initial security awareness training. This leaves new hires potentially unaware of critical security policies, best practices, and common threats (e.g., phishing) during their initial employment period, increasing the risk of human error-related incidents. This was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "New employees",
                            "Onboarding process"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately address the exposed RDP service by either closing port 3389 or implementing strict access controls, such as VPN-only access and IP whitelisting, alongside strong password policies. Furthermore, the organization must prioritize the implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and, critically, for access to all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access from compromised credentials. Finally, a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees should be established as part of the onboarding process to ensure all personnel are equipped with essential security knowledge from day one.",
            "Conclusion": "The current cybersecurity posture of the organization presents several critical and high-severity vulnerabilities, primarily stemming from an exposed RDP service and a significant absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and sensitive data systems. While some foundational security practices are in place, these critical gaps, coupled with a lack of initial security awareness training for new hires, leave the organization highly susceptible to cyberattacks and data breaches. Immediate action on the recommended mitigations is essential to enhance the overall security readiness and protect organizational assets."
