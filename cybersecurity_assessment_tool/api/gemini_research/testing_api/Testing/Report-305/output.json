            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network scan revealed an open RDP port (3389), indicating potential exposure. While the organization has implemented MFA for email and computer logins, there are gaps in security practices. Specifically, MFA is not required for accessing sensitive data systems, there is no employee acceptable use policy, and annual security awareness training for all employees is not conducted.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "RDP Exposure",
                        "Overview": "Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed to the internet via an open port (3389). This allows potential attackers to attempt brute-force attacks or exploit RDP vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to internal systems. The impact could range from unauthorized access to data breaches or system compromise. This was identified through a network port scan.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "IP address with open port 3389"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if credentials are compromised through phishing, malware, or other means. Without MFA, a single compromised password could lead to a severe data breach. This was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Sensitive data systems",
                            "User accounts accessing sensitive data"

                    {
                        "Risk": "Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy",
                        "Overview": "The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This means there are no formal guidelines for employees regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, data handling, and internet usage. This can lead to inconsistent security practices, increased risk of insider threats, and potential legal liabilities. This was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "Company IT resources",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. Regular training is crucial to keep employees informed about evolving threats (e.g., new phishing techniques, social engineering tactics) and reinforce best practices. Lack of ongoing training increases the risk of human error leading to security incidents. This was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "Organizational security posture"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately close the exposed RDP port (3389) or restrict access to trusted IP addresses only. For secure remote access, implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution. Furthermore, implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to guide appropriate IT resource usage and data handling. Finally, establish and regularly conduct annual security awareness training for all employees to ensure ongoing vigilance against evolving cyber threats.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces critical security risks, primarily due to an exposed RDP service and significant gaps in its security policies and training programs. While MFA is in place for email and computer logins, the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems, a formal acceptable use policy, and annual security awareness training leaves the organization vulnerable to data breaches, insider threats, and human-factor errors. Addressing these vulnerabilities is crucial for enhancing the overall cybersecurity posture and readiness."
