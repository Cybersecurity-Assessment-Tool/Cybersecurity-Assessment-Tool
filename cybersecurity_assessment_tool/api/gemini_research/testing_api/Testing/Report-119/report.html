        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization currently employs Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access, which is a positive security measure. However, a significant gap exists as MFA is not required for logging into computers or accessing sensitive data systems. An employee acceptable use policy is in place, but there is a complete absence of security awareness training for both new and existing employees. Network scans identified an open SSH port (22) on a host, indicating a potential attack surface, and a critical 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability was also noted.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A critical vulnerability has been identified where localhost is exposed, potentially allowing unauthorized access or information disclosure. This issue carries a severe impact, as indicated by its critical severity score, and requires immediate remediation to prevent exploitation.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if employee credentials are compromised, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication, making systems vulnerable to brute-force or credential stuffing attacks.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Servers</li><li>Network devices</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not mandated for accessing sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk, as compromised credentials could lead directly to data breaches, intellectual property theft, or regulatory non-compliance, with potentially severe financial and reputational consequences.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>Cloud storage</li><li>File shares</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or annually for all employees. This leaves the workforce vulnerable to social engineering attacks such as phishing and pretexting, and unaware of critical security best practices, thereby increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents and data compromise.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port (22) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A network scan using Nmap identified an open SSH (Secure Shell) port (22) on a host. While SSH is a legitimate service for remote administration, an open port represents an attack surface that can be targeted by threat actors for brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or exploitation of SSH vulnerabilities if not properly secured, monitored, and patched.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with open port 22</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all computer logins and sensitive data systems without delay. This will provide a crucial layer of defense against credential compromise. Furthermore, a comprehensive security awareness training program should be established and regularly conducted for all employees, including new hires, to educate them on common cyber threats and best practices. The identified open SSH port (22) must be reviewed immediately; ensure it is configured with strong authentication, access is restricted to authorized personnel only, and all necessary security patches are applied. Finally, the critical 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability requires thorough investigation and immediate remediation to mitigate its severe impact.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization exhibits a mixed security posture, with some foundational elements like an acceptable use policy and email MFA in place. However, critical vulnerabilities exist due to the lack of MFA for computer and sensitive data system access, and the complete absence of security awareness training. The presence of an open SSH port and a critical 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability further highlights significant areas requiring immediate attention. Addressing these identified risks is paramount to reducing the overall attack surface, improving resilience against cyber threats, and safeguarding organizational assets and data.</p>
