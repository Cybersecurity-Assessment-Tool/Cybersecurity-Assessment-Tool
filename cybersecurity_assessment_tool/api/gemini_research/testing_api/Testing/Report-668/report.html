        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network infrastructure shows an open port 80, indicating a web server is active. While security awareness training is conducted for all employees, critical policy gaps exist, specifically the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and the absence of an employee acceptable use policy. These findings suggest a mixed security posture with significant areas requiring immediate attention to mitigate common attack vectors and establish foundational security controls.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unencrypted Web Traffic / Potential Web Server Vulnerabilities - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open port 80 indicates that a web server is running and potentially serving unencrypted HTTP traffic. This can expose sensitive information transmitted over the network to eavesdropping. Furthermore, the web server itself might have unpatched vulnerabilities (e.g., outdated software, misconfigurations) that could be exploited for unauthorized access, data breaches, or defacement. Without further context on the web server's purpose and configuration, this represents a significant risk.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li><li>Web Server</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. Email accounts are frequently targeted by phishing attacks and credential stuffing. Without MFA, a compromised password (e.g., via a data breach or phishing) grants an attacker full access to an employee's email, which can then be used for further internal phishing, business email compromise (BEC) scams, or accessing other systems via password reset functions.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee Email Accounts</li><li>Email System</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an acceptable use policy (AUP) for employees. An AUP defines the proper use of company assets, networks, and data, setting clear expectations for employee conduct. Without one, employees may unknowingly or intentionally engage in activities that introduce security risks (e.g., installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, mishandling sensitive data), making it harder to enforce security standards and address misuse.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All Employees</li><li>Organizational Network</li><li>Data Assets</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To enhance the organization's security posture, several key recommendations are provided. Firstly, the open port 80 should be thoroughly investigated. If a web server is necessary, it must be secured with HTTPS, kept up-to-date, and regularly patched. Consider restricting access to internal networks if it's not intended for public use. Secondly, implementing mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts is paramount to protect against account takeovers, phishing, and credential stuffing attacks. This is a critical control that significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access. Lastly, developing and enforcing a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy (AUP) is essential. This policy should clearly outline expectations for the use of company resources, data handling, and internet usage, and be communicated to all employees to foster a culture of security and reduce human-related risks. Regular reviews of security configurations and policies are also advised.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The current assessment reveals that while the organization has some positive security practices, such as MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, and regular security awareness training, significant vulnerabilities remain. The presence of an open port 80, coupled with the absence of MFA for email and a formal acceptable use policy, exposes the organization to risks such as unencrypted data transmission, account compromise, and uncontrolled employee behavior. Addressing these critical and high-severity findings is crucial for improving the overall security posture and readiness against prevalent cyber threats.</p>
