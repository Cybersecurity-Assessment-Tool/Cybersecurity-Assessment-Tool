        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization currently employs Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems, and has an acceptable use policy in place. Security awareness training is provided to new employees. However, a network scan revealed an open port 8080 with a title indicating a 'TOP SECRET DB', suggesting a critical exposure. Furthermore, MFA is not required for computer logins, and annual security awareness training for all employees is not conducted, leaving potential gaps in endpoint security and human-factor defenses.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed Sensitive Database Interface - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An Nmap scan identified an open port 8080 on a host, which is serving an HTTP title 'TOP SECRET DB'. This indicates a potentially sensitive database interface is directly exposed to the network. Unauthorized access to this port could lead to severe consequences, including data breaches, unauthorized modification of critical information, or denial of service. The explicit mention of 'TOP SECRET DB' in the title highlights the high-value nature of the data potentially at risk.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li><li>Host with open port 8080</li><li>Application/Service on port 8080 ('TOP SECRET DB')</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Weak Authentication for Computer Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to internal systems if credentials are stolen or compromised through phishing, malware, or brute-force attacks. Without MFA, a single factor (password) is sufficient for gaining access, making endpoints more vulnerable.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This leaves the workforce vulnerable to evolving cyber threats, social engineering techniques, and new attack vectors. Employees may forget best practices or be unaware of new threats, increasing the likelihood of successful phishing attacks, malware infections, or policy violations.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, immediate action is required for the exposed port 8080: investigate the service, implement strict firewall rules to restrict access, and consider placing it behind a reverse proxy with strong authentication or isolating it within a secure network segment. Furthermore, it is strongly recommended to implement mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins across the organization to significantly enhance endpoint security. Finally, establish and enforce a policy for mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees, covering current threat landscapes, phishing recognition, secure browsing habits, and data handling best practices to maintain a vigilant and informed workforce.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization has established some foundational security controls, such as MFA for sensitive systems and an acceptable use policy. However, critical vulnerabilities, including a directly exposed sensitive database interface, a lack of MFA for computer logins, and the absence of regular, organization-wide security awareness training, pose significant risks. Addressing these specific areas is crucial for substantially improving the organization's overall security posture and resilience against potential cyber threats.</p>
