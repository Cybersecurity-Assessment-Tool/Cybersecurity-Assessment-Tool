        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The network scan identified an active host with an open SSH (port 22) service. Organizational data indicates a critical lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA) for computer logins and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct security awareness training for new or existing employees, leaving the workforce vulnerable to social engineering and human error.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if employee credentials are stolen or guessed, as a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to a workstation. This vulnerability was identified through organizational survey data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee workstations</li><li>Network access points requiring login</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Sensitive data systems are not protected by MFA. This poses a critical risk, as unauthorized access to these systems could lead to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and severe reputational damage. A single compromised password could expose critical organizational data. This vulnerability was identified through organizational survey data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases containing sensitive information</li><li>Cloud storage with sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an acceptable use policy for employees. Without a clear AUP, employees may unknowingly engage in activities that pose security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling company data. This lack of policy creates ambiguity regarding expected behavior and makes it difficult to enforce security standards. This vulnerability was identified through organizational survey data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational network</li><li>Data assets</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or annual training for all employees. This leaves the workforce vulnerable to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) and makes them less likely to identify and report suspicious activities. A lack of training significantly increases the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents. This vulnerability was identified through organizational survey data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Email systems</li><li>Internal network</li><li>Data assets</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port Without MFA - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH (port 22) service was detected on an active host, and the organization does not require MFA for computer logins. While SSH itself is a secure protocol, an open port combined with weak authentication (single-factor password) makes the system highly susceptible to brute-force attacks or credential stuffing, potentially leading to unauthorized remote access. This vulnerability was identified via network scan and corroborated by organizational survey data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with open port 22</li><li>SSH service</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and access to sensitive data systems. This is a critical step to significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials. The organization should also develop and disseminate a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), ensuring all employees acknowledge and understand it. Furthermore, establishing a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees and conducting annual refresher training for the entire workforce is essential to educate employees on cybersecurity best practices and reduce human-related risks. For the identified open SSH port, ensure strong, unique passwords are used, and ideally, implement MFA for SSH access. Consider restricting SSH access to specific IP addresses or using key-based authentication instead of passwords where possible, and regularly review SSH logs for suspicious activity.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to a lack of fundamental security controls. The absence of multi-factor authentication for critical systems and computer logins, coupled with a complete lack of security awareness training and an acceptable use policy, creates a highly vulnerable environment. The presence of an open SSH port further exacerbates these risks. Addressing these foundational weaknesses through the immediate implementation of MFA, comprehensive policies, and regular training is paramount to improving the organization's overall security posture and readiness against common cyber threats.</p>
