            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The network assessment revealed an open HTTP port (80) and several critical gaps in the organization's security posture, primarily concerning the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across key access points and a lack of comprehensive security awareness training for new employees. While an acceptable use policy is in place and annual security training is conducted, these foundational weaknesses significantly elevate the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Unsecured Web Service Exposure",
                        "Overview": "An open port 80 (HTTP) was detected, indicating a web server or service is accessible. Without proper security configurations, encryption (HTTPS), and regular patching, this service could be vulnerable to various web-based attacks, including information disclosure, injection attacks, or denial of service. This was identified via an Nmap scan.",

                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of email account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing, as a single compromised password would grant full access.",

                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if user credentials are stolen or guessed, potentially leading to lateral movement within the network and data exfiltration.",

                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk, as unauthorized access to these systems could lead to severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and significant reputational damage.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "New Employee Security Vulnerability",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. This leaves new hires susceptible to social engineering attacks, phishing, and other common threats due to a lack of immediate understanding of organizational security policies and best practices, potentially making them an easy target for attackers.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "New employees",

                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "It is strongly recommended that the organization implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access, computer logins, and especially for sensitive data systems to significantly enhance credential security and prevent unauthorized access. The open port 80 should be secured by implementing HTTPS encryption, ensuring all web traffic is encrypted, and regularly patching the underlying web server software. Furthermore, a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees should be established immediately upon onboarding to ensure they are equipped with essential cybersecurity knowledge from day one. Regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing should also be conducted to identify and address further potential weaknesses.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks due to the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for critical systems and a gap in security awareness training for new employees. While some security measures are in place, these fundamental vulnerabilities create substantial exposure to potential breaches and unauthorized access. Addressing these issues promptly is crucial for improving the overall security posture and protecting sensitive assets."
