        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security practices by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and sensitive data systems, and maintaining an acceptable use policy. New employees receive initial security awareness training. However, critical gaps exist in email security and ongoing employee education, which significantly elevate the overall risk posture.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. Email is a primary vector for phishing attacks, business email compromise (BEC), and malware delivery. Without MFA, compromised credentials (e.g., via phishing) can grant attackers full access to an employee's inbox, leading to data breaches, impersonation, and further internal compromise. This significantly increases the risk of account takeover and subsequent lateral movement within the network.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee email accounts</li><li>Email server/service</li><li>Organizational data accessible via email</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual training for all employees. Cybersecurity threats evolve rapidly, and without regular updates and reinforcement, employees may become complacent or unaware of new attack techniques (e.g., advanced phishing, social engineering tactics, ransomware trends). This oversight leaves the organization vulnerable to human error, which is often exploited by attackers as the weakest link in the security chain.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure (due to potential for human-induced breaches)</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access. This will significantly reduce the risk of account compromise even if credentials are stolen. Furthermore, the organization should establish and enforce a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees. This training should cover current threat landscapes, best practices for identifying phishing attempts, safe browsing habits, and data handling procedures, ensuring that the entire workforce remains vigilant and informed about evolving cyber threats. Regular training will reinforce security policies and reduce the likelihood of human-factor incidents.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently exhibits a mixed security posture. While some critical controls like MFA for sensitive systems and initial employee training are in place, the absence of MFA for email and the lack of recurring annual security awareness training for all employees represent significant vulnerabilities. These gaps expose the organization to a heightened risk of email account compromise, data breaches, and successful social engineering attacks. Addressing these areas is paramount to improving the overall cybersecurity readiness and resilience against modern threats.</p>
