            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network security posture, based on provided policy data, indicates a mixed level of readiness. While strong controls are in place for computer logins and sensitive data system access through Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), critical gaps exist in email security, employee policy enforcement, and ongoing security awareness training. The absence of network scan data or specific system vulnerabilities limits a comprehensive technical assessment, but the policy-level deficiencies present significant organizational risks.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Email Access",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. Compromised email accounts can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and further network penetration. This was identified through the organizational policy data indicating \"No\" for MFA on email.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employee email accounts",
                            "Email servers",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)",
                        "Overview": "The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. Without an AUP, employees may be unaware of their responsibilities regarding the use of company IT resources, data handling, and internet usage. This can lead to increased risks from insider threats, data leakage, malware infections from unapproved software or websites, and non-compliance with industry regulations. This was identified through the organizational policy data indicating \"No\" for an acceptable use policy.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Insufficient Recurring Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This results in a stale understanding of evolving threats, new company policies, and best practices among existing staff. Employees are the first line of defense, and a lack of continuous training makes them more susceptible to social engineering attacks, phishing, and other human-factor vulnerabilities. This was identified through the organizational policy data indicating \"No\" for annual security awareness training for all employees.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "Organizational data",
                            "Network infrastructure",
                            "Incident response capabilities"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, the organization should immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication for all email access to prevent unauthorized account compromise. A comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy must be developed, communicated, and enforced to establish clear guidelines for IT resource usage and data handling. Furthermore, a mandatory annual security awareness training program should be established for all employees, covering current threat landscapes, policy updates, and best practices to maintain a strong human firewall against cyber threats. Regular reviews of these policies and controls are also recommended to adapt to evolving security challenges.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems. However, significant vulnerabilities exist due to the absence of MFA for email, a formal acceptable use policy, and consistent annual security awareness training for all staff. These gaps expose the organization to elevated risks of account compromise, insider threats, and human-factor vulnerabilities. Addressing these policy and training deficiencies is crucial for enhancing the overall security posture and readiness against common cyber threats."
