        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan identified an open SSH port (22), indicating a potential entry point that requires secure configuration. A review of organizational data reveals significant gaps in foundational security practices. Specifically, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for email access, computer logins, or sensitive data systems, leaving critical assets vulnerable to credential-based attacks. Furthermore, the absence of an employee acceptable use policy and a lack of security awareness training for new employees introduce considerable human-factor risks, despite annual training for existing staff. These deficiencies suggest a low security readiness posture, making the organization susceptible to various cyber threats.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A critical service on localhost is exposed, potentially allowing unauthorized access or internal network reconnaissance. This vulnerability was identified through a network scan showing an open port 22 (SSH) without sufficient context to determine if it's intentionally exposed or misconfigured, posing a severe risk if not properly secured.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for email access. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing, potentially leading to data breaches, business email compromise (BEC), and further network infiltration.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for logging into computers. This leaves employee workstations vulnerable to unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised, potentially allowing attackers to gain a foothold within the internal network, access sensitive data, and deploy malware.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Internal network</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA to access sensitive data systems. This is a critical vulnerability as it means a single compromised credential could grant an attacker direct access to the organization's most valuable and confidential information, leading to severe data breaches, regulatory fines, and reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>File servers</li></ul>

            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines, employees may engage in activities that introduce security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling company data, leading to increased exposure to malware, data loss, and compliance violations.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee behavior</li><li>Network security</li><li>Data integrity</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Incomplete Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. This means new hires may not be aware of critical security best practices, common threats (like phishing), and organizational policies from day one, making them immediate targets for social engineering attacks and increasing the likelihood of human error-induced security incidents.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is imperative to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, including email systems, computer logins, and especially sensitive data systems, to prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised. The open SSH port (22) should be immediately reviewed; if not essential, it should be closed, or if required, secured with strong authentication, least privilege access, and regular patching. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to guide appropriate digital behavior and reduce human-factor risks. Crucially, establish a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees from their first day, complementing the existing annual training, to ensure a consistent baseline of security knowledge across the entire workforce. Regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing should also be conducted to identify and address new exposures proactively.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces a significant number of critical and high-severity vulnerabilities, primarily stemming from a lack of fundamental security controls such as Multi-Factor Authentication and comprehensive employee policies and training. While annual security awareness training is in place, the absence of initial training for new hires and a formal acceptable use policy creates substantial human-factor risks. The presence of an exposed localhost service further compounds the technical vulnerabilities. Overall, the organization's current security readiness is low, necessitating immediate and strategic implementation of the recommended security measures to protect against potential cyberattacks and data breaches.</p>
