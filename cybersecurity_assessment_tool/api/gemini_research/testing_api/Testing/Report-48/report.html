        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization currently lacks critical multi-factor authentication (MFA) controls across key access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. While an acceptable use policy is in place, there is a significant gap in security awareness training for both new hires and existing employees on an annual basis. The absence of these fundamental security measures indicates a heightened risk posture for the organization.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require multi-factor authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee inboxes through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks, potentially leading to data breaches, business email compromise (BEC), and further lateral movement within the network. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee email accounts</li><li>Email server/service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is not required for logging into organizational computers. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are compromised. An attacker gaining access to a computer could potentially access internal resources, sensitive data, and propagate malware. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All organizational computers/endpoints</li><li>Active Directory/Identity Provider</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for accessing systems containing sensitive data. This is a critical security gap, as compromised credentials could grant direct access to highly confidential information, leading to severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and significant reputational damage. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>File shares</li><li>Cloud storage</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate New Employee Security Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. This means new hires may not be aware of common cyber threats (e.g., phishing, social engineering), organizational security policies, or best practices for protecting sensitive information, increasing the likelihood of human-factor security incidents. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>Organizational data and systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not provide security awareness training to all employees at least once per year. Without regular training, employees may forget best practices, fail to recognize evolving threats, or become complacent, leading to a higher risk of security incidents caused by human error or successful social engineering attacks. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All existing employees</li><li>Organizational data and systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, immediate implementation of multi-factor authentication (MFA) is strongly recommended across all critical access points: email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. This single control will drastically reduce the risk of credential-based attacks. Furthermore, a comprehensive security awareness training program should be established. This program must include mandatory training for all new employees upon onboarding and annual refresher training for all existing staff. Training should cover topics such as phishing recognition, strong password practices, data handling policies, and incident reporting procedures. Regular security audits and policy reviews should also be conducted to ensure ongoing compliance and adaptation to new threats.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces a high level of cybersecurity risk primarily due to the absence of multi-factor authentication for critical systems and a significant lack of ongoing security awareness training for its workforce. While an acceptable use policy is in place, the foundational human and technical controls necessary to protect against common and sophisticated cyber threats are largely missing. Addressing these vulnerabilities is paramount to safeguarding organizational assets, maintaining data integrity, and ensuring business continuity.</p>
