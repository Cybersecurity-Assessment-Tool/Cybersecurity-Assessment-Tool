        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Based on the provided network scan data, the target network appears to have no open ports, suggesting a potentially well-hardened perimeter or a limited scope scan. However, the organizational data reveals several critical areas where security posture can be significantly improved. The organization currently implements MFA for email access and has an acceptable use policy, along with initial security awareness training for new employees. Despite these positive aspects, there are notable gaps in multi-factor authentication implementation for computer logins and sensitive data systems, as well as a lack of recurring security awareness training for all employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for employees to log into their computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are compromised through phishing, keyloggers, or brute-force attacks. Without a second factor, a stolen password is often sufficient to gain access to an employee's workstation and potentially the internal network. This was identified from the organizational data stating "Do you require MFA to log into computers?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Internal network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not enforced for accessing sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk, as compromised credentials could grant attackers direct access to confidential information, leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and severe reputational damage. Protecting sensitive data systems with MFA is a fundamental security control. This was identified from the organizational data stating "Do you require MFA to access sensitive data systems?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>Cloud storage containing confidential information</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Recurring Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual or regular security awareness training for all employees. This leaves the workforce vulnerable to evolving social engineering tactics, phishing schemes, and other cyber threats. Without ongoing education, employees may forget best practices or remain unaware of new threats, increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents. This was identified from the organizational data stating "Does your organization do security awareness training for all employees at least once per year?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network security</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points. Specifically, MFA should be mandated for all computer logins to protect employee workstations and internal network access. Furthermore, MFA must be enforced for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access to critical information. In parallel, a comprehensive and recurring security awareness training program should be established for all employees, conducted at least annually. This training should cover current threat landscapes, phishing recognition, password hygiene, and data handling best practices to ensure the workforce remains a strong line of defense against cyber threats. Regular training will help reinforce security policies and adapt to new attack vectors.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently exhibits a foundational level of security with MFA for email and initial security awareness training for new hires. However, significant vulnerabilities exist due to the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for computer logins and sensitive data systems, which are critical gaps that could lead to unauthorized access and data breaches. Additionally, the lack of recurring security awareness training for all employees leaves the organization susceptible to human-factor risks. Addressing these identified vulnerabilities through the implementation of comprehensive MFA and ongoing security education is paramount to improving the overall cybersecurity readiness and resilience of the organization.</p>
