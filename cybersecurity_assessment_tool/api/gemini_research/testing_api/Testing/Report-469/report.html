        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes an Nginx web server (version 1.18.0) on port 443 (HTTPS). While an acceptable use policy is in place and new employees receive security awareness training, there are significant gaps in multi-factor authentication (MFA) implementation and ongoing security training. MFA is not required for email access or computer logins, although it is mandated for sensitive data systems. Furthermore, annual security awareness training for all employees is not conducted.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Email accounts are a primary target for phishing and credential stuffing attacks. Without multi-factor authentication (MFA), a single compromised password can grant an attacker unauthorized access to sensitive communications, data, and potentially facilitate lateral movement within the organization. This vulnerability was identified by the organization's stated policy of not requiring MFA for email access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Without multi-factor authentication (MFA) for computer logins, a single compromised password can grant an attacker access to an employee's workstation. This could lead to data exfiltration, malware deployment, or further network compromise, as the workstation often serves as an entry point to internal resources. This vulnerability was identified by the organization's stated policy of not requiring MFA for computer logins.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Nginx Web Server - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nginx web server running version 1.18.0 is outdated and no longer receives official security updates or support. This means it likely contains known vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access, perform denial-of-service attacks, or execute arbitrary code, posing a significant risk to the web service and potentially the underlying infrastructure. This was identified during the network scan.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Web server (nginx 1.18.0)</li><li>HTTPS service on port 443</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive initial training, the absence of annual security awareness training means employees may not be updated on the latest threats, evolving best practices, or changes in organizational policies. This increases the overall risk of successful phishing attacks, social engineering, and other human-factor vulnerabilities that can lead to security incidents. This vulnerability was identified by the organization's stated policy.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all email access and computer logins across the entire organization. This critical step will drastically reduce the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials. Furthermore, the Nginx web server (version 1.18.0) should be immediately updated to a currently supported and patched version to mitigate known vulnerabilities. Regular patching and version upgrades for all software are essential. Finally, a comprehensive annual security awareness training program for all employees should be established and enforced to ensure staff are continuously educated on the latest cyber threats and best security practices, thereby reducing human-factor risks.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates some foundational security practices, such as an acceptable use policy and initial security awareness training for new hires, and correctly applies MFA to sensitive data systems. However, critical vulnerabilities exist due to the lack of MFA for email and computer logins, the use of an outdated and unsupported web server, and the absence of ongoing, annual security awareness training for all staff. These gaps collectively expose the organization to a high risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and successful cyberattacks, indicating a moderate level of readiness that requires immediate attention and remediation.</p>
