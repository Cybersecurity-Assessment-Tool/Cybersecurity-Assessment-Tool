        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network includes a MySQL database server (version 5.7.33) with port 3306 openly accessible to the network. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for email and sensitive data systems, it is not required for computer logins. The organization has an acceptable use policy in place, but critically lacks security awareness training for both new and existing employees, indicating a significant gap in its human-centric security measures.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network, potentially exposing the database to unauthorized access or attacks. The identified version is MySQL 5.7.33. This direct exposure significantly increases the attack surface, as attackers could attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities in this specific MySQL version or brute-force credentials, leading to data breaches or service disruption.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This significantly weakens the security posture, as compromised credentials (e.g., via phishing or malware) could grant attackers direct access to internal systems without a second factor of authentication, increasing the risk of lateral movement and data exfiltration.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers</li><li>Internal network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees, nor does it provide annual training for all employees. This leaves the workforce vulnerable to social engineering attacks (phishing, pretexting, etc.) and increases the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents, such as clicking malicious links, downloading malware, or mishandling sensitive information.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data and systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted IP addresses or internal networks. For a long-term solution, consider placing the database behind a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or implementing a more robust access control mechanism. Crucially, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be enforced for all computer logins to prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised. Furthermore, a comprehensive security awareness training program should be established, including mandatory training for all new hires and annual refreshers for all employees, to educate staff on common threats like phishing and best security practices. Regularly patching and updating the MySQL server and other software is also essential to address known vulnerabilities.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces critical security vulnerabilities, primarily due to an openly exposed MySQL database and significant gaps in its human-centric security defenses. The lack of MFA for computer logins and the absence of regular security awareness training for employees create substantial entry points for attackers. While MFA is used for email and sensitive data systems, these other weaknesses undermine the overall security posture. Addressing these issues promptly through technical controls and employee education is paramount to enhancing the organization's readiness against cyber threats.</p>
