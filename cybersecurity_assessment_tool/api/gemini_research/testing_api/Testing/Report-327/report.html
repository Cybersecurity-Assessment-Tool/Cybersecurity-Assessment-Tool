        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes a MySQL database (version 5.7.33) on port 3306, which is a significant security concern. While the organization demonstrates strong security practices in some areas, such as requiring MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, and conducting regular security awareness training, a critical gap exists in email security. Specifically, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for email access, leaving employee email accounts vulnerable to compromise. An acceptable use policy is in place, and security awareness training is provided for both new and existing employees annually.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is openly accessible on the network, running version 5.7.33. This direct exposure of a database service significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, or denial-of-service attacks if vulnerabilities in the MySQL server are exploited or if weak credentials are used. This vulnerability was identified through an Nmap network scan.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li><li>MySQL Database Server</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This policy significantly elevates the risk of email account compromise through common attack vectors such as phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks. A compromised email account can lead to business email compromise (BEC), unauthorized access to sensitive information, or serve as an entry point for further network penetration. This vulnerability was identified through a review of organizational security policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee email accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306 to only authorized internal IP addresses or specific services. For long-term security, consider placing the database behind a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or within a segmented network accessible only via secure channels. Concurrently, the organization must implement and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access to significantly reduce the risk of email account compromise. Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments should also be conducted to ensure ongoing security posture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization exhibits a mixed security posture. While commendable efforts are made in security awareness training and MFA for critical internal systems, the direct exposure of a MySQL database and the absence of MFA for email access represent critical vulnerabilities that could lead to significant data breaches or operational disruptions. Addressing these high-severity risks promptly is crucial for enhancing the overall cybersecurity readiness of the organization.</p>
