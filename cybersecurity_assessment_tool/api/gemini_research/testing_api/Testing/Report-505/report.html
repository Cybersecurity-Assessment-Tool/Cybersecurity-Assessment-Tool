        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open HTTPS service (port 443) running Nginx version 1.18.0. Internally, the organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and maintains an employee acceptable use policy, along with annual security awareness training for all employees. However, critical gaps exist in security posture, specifically regarding MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, and the absence of security awareness training for new employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to endpoints if employee credentials are compromised through phishing, malware, or other attack vectors. Without MFA, a single factor (password) is the only barrier to entry, making systems more vulnerable to credential stuffing and brute-force attacks.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers</li><li>Network endpoints</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk to the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information. If an attacker gains access to credentials for these systems, they can directly access, modify, or exfiltrate sensitive data without an additional layer of security, potentially leading to severe data breaches and regulatory non-compliance.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>Cloud storage containing sensitive information</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering attacks, such as phishing or pretexting, as they may be less familiar with organizational security policies, common threats, and incident reporting procedures. This oversight leaves the organization vulnerable to human-factor exploits from the moment an employee joins, potentially leading to initial access for attackers.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>Organizational network</li><li>Email systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and, critically, for access to all sensitive data systems. This will significantly enhance protection against credential theft and unauthorized access. Furthermore, a comprehensive security awareness training program should be established for all new employees, covering common threats, organizational policies, and incident reporting procedures, to reduce the human element of risk. Additionally, ensure the Nginx server (version 1.18.0) is regularly patched and updated to the latest stable version to address any known vulnerabilities.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has some foundational security measures in place, such as MFA for email and annual security training, significant vulnerabilities exist due to the absence of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, and a lack of security awareness training for new employees. Addressing these critical gaps is paramount to enhancing the overall security posture and readiness against modern cyber threats, particularly those targeting credentials and human factors.</p>
