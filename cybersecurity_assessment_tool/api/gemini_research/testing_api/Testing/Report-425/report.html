        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) port (3389) directly exposed to the internet, presenting a critical vulnerability. Furthermore, an assessment of organizational policies indicates a lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA) for computer logins and an absence of both new employee and annual security awareness training for all staff. While MFA is used for email and sensitive data systems, these gaps significantly weaken the overall security posture.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>RDP Exposure - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed directly to the internet via port 3389 (ms-wbt-server). This allows potential attackers to attempt brute-force attacks or exploit vulnerabilities in the RDP service to gain unauthorized access to internal systems. The impact could range from unauthorized access to data exfiltration or system compromise. This was identified by an open port 3389 during the network scan.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP address of the exposed host (port 3389)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication. An attacker gaining access to a single set of credentials could potentially compromise an entire workstation or network segment. This was identified through the organizational policy assessment.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers</li><li>Network endpoints</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of New Employee Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. This leaves new hires potentially unaware of critical security policies, common threats (e.g., phishing, social engineering), and best practices, making them more susceptible to falling victim to attacks that could compromise organizational security. This was identified through the organizational policy assessment.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. Regular training is crucial to keep employees updated on evolving threats, reinforce security best practices, and maintain a strong human firewall. Without it, employees may forget previous training or be unaware of new attack vectors, increasing the risk of human error leading to security incidents. This was identified through the organizational policy assessment.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately close the exposed RDP port (3389) to the internet. For necessary remote access, implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution to secure connections. Furthermore, implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to significantly enhance credential security. Establish a comprehensive security awareness training program that includes mandatory training for all new employees and annual refresher training for all staff to foster a security-conscious culture and reduce human-related risks.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces critical and high-severity risks primarily due to an internet-exposed RDP service and a lack of MFA for computer logins. Additionally, the absence of a robust security awareness training program for both new and existing employees presents a significant vulnerability to social engineering and other human-centric attacks. While MFA is in place for email and sensitive data systems, these critical gaps indicate a moderate level of readiness, requiring immediate attention to strengthen the overall security posture and protect against potential breaches.</p>
