        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The provided network scan data was empty, indicating no network-level vulnerabilities were identified through automated scanning. However, an assessment of the organization's security posture based on provided organizational data reveals several critical gaps in security policies and employee training. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for email and computer logins, it is notably absent for sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization lacks fundamental security practices such as an acceptable use policy and regular security awareness training for both new and existing employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Access Control for Sensitive Data - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if primary credentials are compromised (e.g., via phishing or brute-force attacks). Without MFA, a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to sensitive data, leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and reputational damage. This was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy (AUP). An AUP defines the proper and improper use of organizational IT resources, including networks, systems, and data. Without a clear AUP, employees may inadvertently or intentionally engage in activities that pose security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive information. This increases the likelihood of malware infections, data leakage, and compliance violations. This was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee workstations</li><li>Organizational network</li><li>Employee behavior</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Onboarding Security Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) as they may be less familiar with organizational security protocols and common threats. Without initial training, new employees are more susceptible to falling for scams, introducing malware, or inadvertently exposing sensitive information, thereby increasing the organization's overall attack surface. This was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational network</li><li>Email systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Stale Security Awareness - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. Regular training is crucial to keep employees informed about evolving threats, new policies, and best practices. Without annual refreshers, employees may forget previous training, become complacent, or remain unaware of emerging attack vectors (e.g., new phishing techniques, ransomware trends). This significantly elevates the risk of human error leading to security incidents. This was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational network</li><li>Email systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access in the event of credential compromise. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy (AUP) that clearly outlines expectations for the proper use of IT resources and data. Establish a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees during their onboarding process. Additionally, implement annual security awareness training for all employees to ensure they remain informed about current threats, best practices, and organizational policies, thereby fostering a stronger security culture and reducing human-factor risks.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently exhibits a mixed state of security readiness. While some foundational controls like MFA for email and computer logins are in place, significant vulnerabilities exist due to the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems, a formal acceptable use policy, and consistent security awareness training for its workforce. These gaps expose the organization to increased risks of data breaches, compliance failures, and successful social engineering attacks. Addressing these policy and training deficiencies is paramount to enhancing the overall security posture and reducing the likelihood of security incidents.</p>
