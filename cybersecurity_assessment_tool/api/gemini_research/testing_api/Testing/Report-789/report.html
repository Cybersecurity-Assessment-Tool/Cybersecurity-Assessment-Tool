        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open port 8080 with a service titled 'TOP SECRET DB', indicating a potential exposure of sensitive information. While an internal assessment claimed this to be a false positive, the title itself warrants further investigation. Organizational data indicates a strong posture regarding MFA for computers and sensitive data systems, and regular security awareness training. However, critical gaps exist in email security, with no MFA required for email access, and a complete absence of an employee acceptable use policy.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed Sensitive System Information - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open port 8080 was identified on the network, exposing a service titled 'TOP SECRET DB'. This title suggests a potentially sensitive system is accessible, which represents a significant information disclosure risk and could attract targeted attacks. Although an internal assessment claimed this to be a false positive and secure, the explicit 'TOP SECRET DB' title detected via Nmap's http-title script necessitates immediate verification and remediation if found to be genuinely exposed.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li><li>Service titled 'TOP SECRET DB'</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing employee email accounts. This significantly elevates the risk of account compromise through common attack vectors such as phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks. A single compromised password could grant unauthorized access to sensitive communications and data within an employee's email, leading to further breaches or business email compromise (BEC) incidents. This vulnerability was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee email accounts</li><li>Email system</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). Without a clear AUP, employees may be unaware of their responsibilities and the permissible use of company IT assets, data, and networks. This can lead to unintentional misuse, increased risk of data breaches, non-compliance with security best practices, and difficulty in enforcing security standards. This vulnerability was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT assets</li><li>Company data</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately investigate the service exposed on port 8080, verify its security posture, and ensure that no sensitive information is genuinely exposed. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all employee email accounts without delay to significantly reduce the risk of email account compromise. Furthermore, develop and implement a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) that clearly outlines expectations for the use of company resources, and ensure all employees are trained on and acknowledge this policy. Regular security audits and penetration testing should be conducted to proactively identify and address potential vulnerabilities.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security through its use of MFA for critical systems and regular security awareness training. However, the presence of an exposed service with a 'TOP SECRET DB' title, the absence of MFA for email, and the lack of an acceptable use policy represent significant vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors. Addressing these critical gaps is paramount to enhancing the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and readiness against evolving threats.</p>
