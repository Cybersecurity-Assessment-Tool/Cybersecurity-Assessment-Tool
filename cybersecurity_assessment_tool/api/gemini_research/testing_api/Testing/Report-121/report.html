        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network footprint appears limited, with a single identified host running an Nginx web server on port 443 (HTTPS). While MFA is used for email access, there are significant gaps in foundational security practices, including the absence of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, a lack of an employee acceptable use policy, and no formal security awareness training for new or existing employees. This indicates a low level of organizational security readiness despite a seemingly small network.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Web Server Software - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nginx web server identified on port 443 is running version 1.18.0. This version is significantly outdated and likely contains known vulnerabilities that have been patched in newer releases. Running outdated software exposes the organization to potential exploits, including remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure, which could be leveraged by attackers. This was identified via an Nmap scan.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Nginx 1.18.0 on port 443</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to internal systems if employee credentials are compromised through phishing, malware, or other means. A single factor (password) is insufficient to protect against modern credential theft attacks.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Server access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access sensitive data systems. This critical oversight leaves sensitive information highly vulnerable. If an attacker gains access to a single set of credentials, they could potentially compromise critical data without any additional security barrier, leading to data breaches, regulatory fines, and reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>File servers</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without a clear AUP, employees may be unaware of their responsibilities regarding the use of company IT resources, data handling, internet usage, and security protocols. This absence of guidelines can lead to risky behaviors, misuse of company assets, data leakage, and potential compliance violations.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering attacks, such as phishing, due to their unfamiliarity with company-specific security policies and common threats. This lack of initial training leaves them unprepared and increases the risk of human-factor security incidents from the outset.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Email systems</li><li>Internal networks</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Regular Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not provide annual security awareness training for all employees. Without regular training, employees may forget best practices, become complacent, or fail to adapt to evolving cyber threats. This significantly increases the organization's susceptibility to various attacks, including phishing, malware, and other social engineering tactics, as the human element remains the weakest link.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately update the Nginx web server to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities. Furthermore, implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and, critically, for access to sensitive data systems, should be prioritized to significantly enhance credential security. The organization must develop and enforce a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy to guide employee behavior regarding IT resources. Finally, establishing a robust security awareness training program, including mandatory training for all new employees and annual refresher training for all staff, is essential to cultivate a security-conscious culture and reduce human-factor risks.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks stemming from outdated software and, more critically, from fundamental gaps in its security posture related to access control, employee policies, and security awareness. While the network footprint appears small, the identified vulnerabilities, particularly the lack of MFA for sensitive systems and insufficient employee training, expose the organization to a high likelihood of compromise. Immediate action on the provided recommendations is crucial to improve the organization's overall security readiness and protect its assets.</p>
