        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a good foundation in security awareness, with regular training for all employees and an acceptable use policy in place. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is implemented for computer logins and access to sensitive data systems, which is a strong security measure. However, a critical gap exists in the security posture regarding email access, where MFA is not enforced. The network scan identified an Nginx web server (version 1.18.0) running HTTPS on port 443, which is an older version and may pose a risk due to potential unpatched vulnerabilities.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing employee email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to email through phishing, brute-force attacks, or compromised credentials. If an attacker gains access to an email account, they could impersonate employees, launch further phishing attacks, access sensitive information, or reset passwords for other services, leading to severe data breaches and operational disruptions. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee email accounts</li><li>Email server/service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Web Server Software - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nginx web server identified on port 443 is running version 1.18.0. This version was released in April 2020 and is significantly older than the current stable releases. Running outdated software increases the risk of unpatched vulnerabilities, as newer versions often include critical security fixes and improvements. While no specific critical CVEs were immediately identified for this exact version in the provided data, the general practice of not keeping server software up-to-date exposes the organization to known and unknown security flaws that have been addressed in later versions. This was identified via network scanning.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Web server (Nginx 1.18.0)</li><li>Port 443</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all employee email accounts. This is a critical step to protect against credential compromise and unauthorized access. Additionally, the Nginx web server should be updated to the latest stable version to ensure all known security patches and improvements are applied, reducing the risk of exploitation from outdated software vulnerabilities. Regular patching and update cycles should be established for all public-facing services.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization has a commendable baseline for security awareness and MFA implementation for sensitive systems and computer logins. However, the absence of MFA for email access represents a significant and high-severity vulnerability that could lead to widespread compromise. Furthermore, the use of outdated web server software introduces unnecessary risk. Addressing these specific vulnerabilities will substantially enhance the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and readiness against common attack vectors.</p>
