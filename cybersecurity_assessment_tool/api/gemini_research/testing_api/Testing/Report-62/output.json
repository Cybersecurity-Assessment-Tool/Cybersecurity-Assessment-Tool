                "Summary": "The organization's network includes an FTP server running vsftpd 2.3.4, which was found to allow anonymous access. Workstations are operating on Windows 7, an end-of-life operating system. While the organization has implemented MFA for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, and has an acceptable use policy, there are significant gaps in its security awareness training program, specifically lacking training for new employees and annual training for all staff.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Anonymous FTP Access",
                        "Overview": "The FTP server (vsftpd 2.3.4) allows anonymous login, which could lead to unauthorized access to files, data leakage, or the upload of malicious content. This was identified via an Nmap scan using the 'ftp-anon' script.",
                        "Severity": "High",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Outdated Operating System",
                        "Overview": "Workstations are currently running Windows 7, an operating system that has reached its end-of-life and no longer receives security updates from Microsoft. This exposes the organization to known and newly discovered vulnerabilities, making systems highly susceptible to exploitation, malware infections, and data breaches.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Workstations running Windows 7"
                        ]

                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of New Employee Security Training",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. This increases the risk of new hires falling victim to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) or inadvertently introducing security risks due to a lack of understanding of security best practices and organizational policies.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All new employees",
                            "Organizational data/systems"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of Annual Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This leaves the workforce susceptible to evolving cyber threats, as employees may not be updated on the latest attack vectors, phishing techniques, or internal security policies, increasing the likelihood of successful social engineering attacks or policy violations.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "Organizational data/systems"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "Immediate action should be taken to disable anonymous access on the FTP server and ensure proper authentication and authorization controls are in place. All workstations running Windows 7 must be upgraded to a currently supported operating system, such as Windows 10 or 11, to receive critical security updates. Furthermore, the organization must establish and implement a comprehensive security awareness training program, including mandatory training for all new employees and annual refresher training for the entire staff, to mitigate human-factor risks and improve overall security posture.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces significant security vulnerabilities, primarily stemming from an insecurely configured FTP server, the use of end-of-life operating systems on workstations, and a critical lack of security awareness training for its workforce. While MFA is in place for key systems, these identified gaps create substantial exposure to data breaches, malware, and social engineering attacks, indicating a moderate to low level of readiness against modern cyber threats. Addressing these issues is paramount to improving the organization's security posture."
