        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Based on the provided network scan, no open ports or immediate network-level vulnerabilities were identified. The organization has implemented some foundational security measures, including Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and sensitive data systems, and maintains an employee acceptable use policy. Security awareness training is provided for new employees. However, there are notable gaps in the security posture related to email access and ongoing employee training.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. Email accounts are frequently targeted by phishing attacks and credential stuffing. Without MFA, a compromised password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's email, leading to potential data breaches, business email compromise (BEC) scams, and further lateral movement within the network. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating "No" to MFA for email access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee email accounts</li><li>Email servers</li><li>Organizational data accessible via email</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. While new employees receive training, ongoing education is crucial to keep all staff informed about evolving threats (e.g., new phishing techniques, social engineering tactics, malware trends) and best practices. A lack of regular training increases the likelihood of employees falling victim to cyberattacks, thereby compromising organizational security. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating "No" to annual security awareness training for all employees.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure (due to potential user-initiated compromises)</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access. This critical step will significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access to email accounts, even if passwords are compromised. Additionally, the organization should establish and enforce a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees. This training should cover current threat landscapes, best practices for identifying and reporting suspicious activities, and the importance of data protection. Regular training will foster a stronger security culture and empower employees to be the first line of defense against cyber threats.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently exhibits a foundational level of security readiness with MFA for critical systems and initial employee training. However, the absence of MFA for email access and the lack of comprehensive annual security awareness training for all employees represent significant vulnerabilities. Addressing these gaps is paramount to mitigating the risk of credential compromise, phishing attacks, and human-error-induced breaches, thereby strengthening the overall cybersecurity posture.</p>
