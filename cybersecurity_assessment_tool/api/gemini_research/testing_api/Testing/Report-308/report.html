        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan indicates an open HTTP port (80), suggesting the presence of a web server that may be serving unencrypted content. While MFA is required for computer logins, it is notably absent for email access and sensitive data systems, which represents a significant security gap. The organization has an acceptable use policy and provides security awareness training for new employees, but lacks annual recurring training for all staff, which can lead to a degradation of security posture over time.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. Email accounts often contain sensitive information and can be used as a pivot point for further attacks.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if a single factor (e.g., password) is compromised. Attackers gaining access to these systems could lead to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and significant reputational and financial damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Critical databases</li><li>Confidential information</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This leads to a degradation of security knowledge over time, making employees more susceptible to evolving social engineering tactics (e.g., advanced phishing, pretexting) and less aware of current security best practices. A well-trained workforce is a critical defense layer.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open HTTP Port (Port 80) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A network scan revealed that port 80 (HTTP) is open. While this may be intentional for a web server, serving content over unencrypted HTTP exposes traffic to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks, potentially revealing sensitive information transmitted between clients and the server. Without HTTPS, data integrity and confidentiality cannot be guaranteed.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Web server</li><li>Network traffic</li><li>Client browsers</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>It is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and sensitive data systems to significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials. Furthermore, the organization should establish a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees to ensure continuous education on evolving cyber threats and best practices. For the open HTTP port, it is advised to transition all web services to HTTPS using SSL/TLS certificates to encrypt data in transit and protect against eavesdropping and tampering. If port 80 is not actively used, it should be closed or filtered at the firewall.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational level of security with MFA for computer logins and initial employee training. However, critical vulnerabilities exist due to the absence of MFA for email and sensitive data systems, and the lack of ongoing security awareness training. The presence of an open HTTP port also poses a risk for unencrypted data transmission. Addressing these areas is crucial for enhancing the overall security posture and readiness against common cyber threats.</p>
