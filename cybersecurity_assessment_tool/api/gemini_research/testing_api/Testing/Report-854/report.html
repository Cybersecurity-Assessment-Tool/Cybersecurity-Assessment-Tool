        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently presents several critical vulnerabilities. A host was identified with an open FTP service (vsftpd 2.3.4) allowing anonymous login, posing a significant data leakage and integrity risk. Furthermore, the organization lacks fundamental security controls, including the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. There is no formal employee acceptable use policy, and while new employees receive security awareness training, it is not conducted annually for all staff. Additionally, workstations are running an outdated and unsupported operating system (Windows 7), leaving them exposed to known exploits.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Anonymous FTP Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The FTP service (vsftpd 2.3.4) on the scanned host allows anonymous login. This configuration enables unauthorized users to access, potentially modify, or exfiltrate files without authentication, severely compromising data confidentiality and integrity. This vulnerability was identified through an Nmap scan utilizing the 'ftp-anon' script.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>FTP Server (vsftpd 2.3.4)</li><li>Host with port 21 open</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email, logging into computers, or accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if user credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or other means, as a single factor (password) is the only barrier to entry.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email systems</li><li>User login systems</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). Without clear guidelines, employees may engage in activities that inadvertently or intentionally compromise security, misuse company resources, or expose the organization to legal and compliance risks. This absence creates an environment of inconsistent security practices and increases the potential for insider threats.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>IT systems</li><li>Organizational data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, there is no mandatory annual training for all employees. This oversight means that existing staff may not be updated on evolving cyber threats, new company policies, or best practices, leading to a degradation of the 'human firewall' over time and increased susceptibility to social engineering attacks and other human-factor vulnerabilities.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Operating System (Windows 7) - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Workstations within the organization are running Windows 7, an operating system that has reached its end-of-life and no longer receives security updates or patches from Microsoft. This leaves these systems highly vulnerable to known exploits and emerging threats, making them easy targets for malware, ransomware, and other forms of cyberattacks, significantly increasing the risk of system compromise and data breaches.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations running Windows 7</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, immediate action is required. First, disable anonymous FTP access and, if FTP functionality is essential, implement a secure alternative like SFTP or FTPS with strong authentication. Second, deploy and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, to significantly enhance account security. Third, develop and implement a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and ensure all employees acknowledge and adhere to it. Fourth, establish a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees to keep them informed about current threats and best practices. Finally, prioritize upgrading all workstations running Windows 7 to a currently supported operating system (e.g., Windows 10 or 11) to ensure they receive vital security updates and patches. Additionally, implement a robust patch management program for all software and operating systems, and consider regular vulnerability scanning and network segmentation to further enhance the security posture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces a high level of cybersecurity risk due to a combination of critical technical vulnerabilities and significant gaps in foundational security policies and training. The presence of anonymous FTP, the complete absence of MFA, and the use of end-of-life operating systems create easily exploitable entry points for attackers. Furthermore, the lack of an AUP and insufficient ongoing security awareness training for employees indicate a weak security culture and an underdeveloped 'human firewall.' Without prompt and comprehensive remediation efforts addressing both technical and policy-based weaknesses, the organization remains highly susceptible to data breaches, system compromises, and operational disruptions. A strategic and multi-layered approach is essential to rapidly improve the overall security posture and readiness.</p>
