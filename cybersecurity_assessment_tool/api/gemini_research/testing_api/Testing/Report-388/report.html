        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, and by conducting annual security awareness training for all employees, complemented by an acceptable use policy. However, a review of the provided network scan data indicates a very limited scope, showing no open ports on the scanned target, which suggests either a highly secure perimeter or an incomplete scan. Critical gaps were identified in the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems and the lack of security awareness training for new employees upon onboarding.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for accessing systems containing sensitive data. This significantly elevates the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches should an attacker compromise a single set of credentials. The impact could include severe data loss, regulatory non-compliance, and significant reputational damage. This vulnerability was identified through the organization's self-reported security policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees are not provided with mandatory security awareness training during their onboarding process. This leaves them susceptible to social engineering attacks, such as phishing and pretexting, and unaware of critical security policies and best practices from the outset of their employment. The potential impact includes successful phishing attacks, malware infections, and inadvertent policy violations. This vulnerability was identified through the organization's self-reported security training practices.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>Organizational network</li><li>Sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access even if primary credentials are compromised. Furthermore, a mandatory security awareness training program should be introduced for all new employees as an integral part of their onboarding process to educate them on current threats and organizational security policies from day one. The existing annual security awareness training for all employees and the acceptable use policy should be maintained and regularly updated. It is also advised to conduct more comprehensive network scans, including internal networks and web applications, to gain a complete understanding of the technical attack surface.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has established some commendable security practices, such as MFA for email and computer logins, and annual security awareness training, critical vulnerabilities exist concerning the protection of sensitive data systems and the initial security education of new employees. Addressing these gaps by implementing MFA for sensitive data and mandatory onboarding security training is crucial to significantly reduce the risk of data breaches and improve overall cybersecurity readiness. The limited scope of the provided network scan data suggests a need for more extensive technical assessments to fully understand the external and internal attack surface.</p>
