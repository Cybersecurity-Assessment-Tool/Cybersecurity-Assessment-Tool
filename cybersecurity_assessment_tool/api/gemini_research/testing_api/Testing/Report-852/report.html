        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network security posture was assessed based on provided organizational data, as detailed network scan data was unavailable. The assessment highlights several critical areas of concern related to access control for email, employee policies, and security awareness training. While multi-factor authentication (MFA) is implemented for computer logins and sensitive data systems, its absence for email access presents a significant vulnerability. Furthermore, the lack of foundational security policies and regular training indicates a low level of organizational readiness against common cyber threats.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts through phishing, brute-force attacks, or compromised credentials. A successful compromise could lead to business email compromise (BEC) scams, data exfiltration, or further network penetration. This vulnerability was identified directly from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li><li>Organizational data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without a clear policy, employees may unknowingly engage in activities that pose security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive data. This increases the likelihood of malware infections, data breaches, and non-compliance with industry regulations. This vulnerability was identified directly from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational network</li><li>Data handling procedures</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering attacks due to their unfamiliarity with organizational security protocols and common threat vectors. This oversight leaves the organization vulnerable to phishing, malware, and other human-factor attacks from the moment an employee joins. This vulnerability was identified directly from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational network</li><li>Data security</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Annual Security Awareness Training for All Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. Regular training is crucial to keep employees informed about evolving threats, reinforce best practices, and maintain a strong security culture. The absence of such training leads to a decay in security knowledge, making the entire workforce more susceptible to sophisticated cyberattacks over time. This vulnerability was identified directly from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li><li>Incident response readiness</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, immediate action is recommended in several key areas. Firstly, implement mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access to prevent unauthorized account compromises. Secondly, develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy that clearly outlines expected behavior regarding IT resources and data handling. Thirdly, establish a robust security awareness training program, ensuring all new employees receive training upon onboarding and that all existing employees undergo annual refresher training to stay informed about current threats and best practices. These measures will collectively reduce the attack surface, improve employee vigilance, and strengthen the overall resilience against cyber threats.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant vulnerabilities primarily due to gaps in access control for email, and a lack of fundamental security policies and employee training programs. While MFA is commendably used for computer logins and sensitive data systems, the absence of it for email access, coupled with no acceptable use policy and insufficient security awareness training, leaves the organization highly susceptible to various cyberattacks. The current readiness level is low, indicating an urgent need for strategic investment in security policies, technology, and employee education to mitigate identified risks and build a more robust defense.</p>
