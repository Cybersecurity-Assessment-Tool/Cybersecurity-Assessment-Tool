        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security through practices such as requiring MFA for email and sensitive data systems, maintaining an acceptable use policy, and conducting regular security awareness training for all employees. However, a critical gap exists in the absence of MFA for computer logins, significantly increasing the risk of unauthorized access to endpoints. Network scanning also revealed an open HTTP port (port 80) on an active host, indicating a potential unencrypted web service that could expose data if not properly secured.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Multi-Factor Authentication for Workstations - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are compromised through phishing, malware, or brute-force attacks. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's workstation and potentially the internal network. This was identified from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Internal network access</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unencrypted Web Service Exposure - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A network scan identified an open HTTP port (port 80) on an active host. While not inherently a vulnerability, exposing services over unencrypted HTTP can lead to the interception of sensitive data (credentials, session tokens, personal information) if not properly secured with HTTPS redirection or a Web Application Firewall (WAF). This also indicates a potential entry point that could be exploited if the underlying web application is vulnerable. This was identified via Nmap scan data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host identified by Nmap scan</li><li>Web service running on port 80</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins across the entire organization. This will provide a crucial layer of defense against credential theft. Additionally, all services running on port 80 should be reviewed; ideally, they should be configured to redirect all traffic to HTTPS (port 443) to ensure data encryption in transit. If redirection is not feasible, ensure that no sensitive data is transmitted over HTTP and that robust security controls like a Web Application Firewall (WAF) are in place to protect the underlying application. Regular vulnerability scanning and patching of all web applications are also advised.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has established a good foundation with security awareness training, acceptable use policies, and MFA for critical systems like email and sensitive data, the absence of MFA for computer logins represents a significant and high-severity vulnerability. The presence of an open HTTP port also warrants immediate attention to prevent potential data exposure. Addressing these key areas will substantially improve the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and reduce its attack surface.</p>
