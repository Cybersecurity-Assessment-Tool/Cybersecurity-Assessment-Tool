        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization operates a web server running Nginx 1.18.0 on port 443 (HTTPS). While security awareness training is conducted for all employees, including new hires, there are significant gaps in access control policies. Specifically, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for email access or sensitive data systems, and there is no formal employee acceptable use policy in place.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not enforced for accessing employee email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to email in the event of compromised credentials (e.g., via phishing or brute-force attacks). Email accounts often contain sensitive information and can be used as a pivot point for further attacks within the organization.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee email accounts</li><li>Email server/service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to log into systems containing sensitive data. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are stolen or guessed. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to sensitive information, leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>File shares</li><li>Applications handling sensitive information</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. This absence means there are no clear guidelines for employees regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, internet access, email, and data handling. This can lead to increased risks from insider threats, misuse of company assets, exposure to malware, and potential legal liabilities due to inappropriate employee conduct.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee workstations</li><li>Network resources</li><li>Internet access</li><li>Data storage</li><li>Company devices</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Nginx Version (Potential) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nginx web server is running version 1.18.0. While not explicitly stated as vulnerable in the provided data, older software versions often contain known security vulnerabilities that have been patched in newer releases. Running an outdated web server increases the attack surface and could allow attackers to exploit known flaws to gain unauthorized access, deface the website, or compromise the underlying server.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Web server (Nginx 1.18.0)</li><li>Web application hosted on Nginx</li><li>Port 443</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, several key measures are recommended. Firstly, immediately implement and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all employee email accounts and sensitive data systems. This critical step will drastically reduce the risk of unauthorized access even if primary credentials are compromised. Secondly, develop and formally implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy. This policy should clearly define guidelines for the appropriate use of company IT resources, internet, email, and data handling, and all employees must be trained on its contents. Finally, review the Nginx web server version (1.18.0) and plan for an upgrade to the latest stable release to patch any known vulnerabilities and benefit from security enhancements. Regular patching and updates for all software are crucial for maintaining a strong security posture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security awareness training, which is a positive aspect. However, significant vulnerabilities exist in access control and policy enforcement. The absence of MFA for email and sensitive data systems, coupled with the lack of an acceptable use policy, represents critical and high-severity risks that could lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, and operational disruptions. Addressing these policy and technical gaps is paramount to improving the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and protecting its assets from evolving threats.</p>
