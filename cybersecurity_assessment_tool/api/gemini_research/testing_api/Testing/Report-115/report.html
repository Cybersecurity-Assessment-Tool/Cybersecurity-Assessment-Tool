        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and computer logins, and maintaining an employee acceptable use policy. However, significant gaps exist in critical areas. Specifically, MFA is not mandated for sensitive data systems, leaving high-value assets vulnerable to credential compromise. Furthermore, there is a complete absence of security awareness training for both new hires and existing employees on an annual basis, which significantly elevates the risk of human error and susceptibility to social engineering attacks. Network scanning revealed an open SSH (Port 22) service, which, while potentially legitimate, represents a common target for attackers if not rigorously secured.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if credentials are compromised through phishing, keylogging, or other means. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to sensitive data, leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and reputational damage. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on sensitive data systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Increased Human Error and Phishing Susceptibility - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often unfamiliar with the organization's specific security policies, common threat vectors (like phishing, social engineering), and best practices for data handling. This lack of initial training makes them more susceptible to falling victim to cyberattacks, potentially introducing malware, disclosing sensitive information, or compromising system integrity. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for security awareness training for new employees.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Stagnant Security Knowledge and Evolving Threat Landscape - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. Cybersecurity threats evolve rapidly, and without regular updates, employees' knowledge of current threats, best practices, and organizational policies can become outdated. This increases the likelihood of employees making security errors, falling for new social engineering tactics, or failing to report suspicious activities, thereby weakening the overall security posture. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for annual security awareness training.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>SSH Brute-Force and Exploitation - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A network scan identified an open SSH (Port 22) service. While SSH is a legitimate and secure protocol for remote access, an open port 22 is a common target for automated brute-force attacks and credential stuffing attempts by malicious actors. If not properly secured with strong passwords, key-based authentication, and rate limiting, this port can serve as an entry point for unauthorized access to internal systems, potentially leading to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further lateral movement within the network. This vulnerability was identified via the Nmap scan data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Server(s) hosting SSH service</li><li>Network perimeter</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems. This critical measure will provide a robust layer of defense against unauthorized access even if primary credentials are compromised. Concurrently, a comprehensive security awareness training program must be established. This program should include mandatory training for all new employees upon onboarding, covering essential security policies, common threats, and best practices. Additionally, annual refresher training for all employees is crucial to keep them informed about evolving cyber threats and maintain a strong security-conscious culture. For the identified open SSH service, a thorough review of its configuration is essential. Implement strong, key-based authentication, disable password authentication where possible, enforce strict access controls (e.g., IP whitelisting), and deploy intrusion detection/prevention systems with rate-limiting capabilities to mitigate brute-force attacks.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has implemented some positive security measures such as MFA for email and computer logins, and an acceptable use policy, its overall cybersecurity readiness is significantly hampered by critical vulnerabilities. The lack of MFA for sensitive data systems and the complete absence of regular security awareness training expose the organization to a high risk of data breaches and successful cyberattacks. Addressing these fundamental weaknesses, alongside securing exposed network services like SSH, is paramount to establishing a resilient and mature security posture capable of defending against the current threat landscape.</p>
