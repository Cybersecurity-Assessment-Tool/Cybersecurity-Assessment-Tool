            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network currently presents several significant security vulnerabilities. An Nmap scan revealed an open FTP service allowing anonymous access, posing a critical risk for data exposure and unauthorized file manipulation. Furthermore, internal policies indicate a lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins, which significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access through compromised credentials. The organization also does not conduct regular security awareness training for new or existing employees, leaving the human element highly susceptible to social engineering and other common attack vectors. Additionally, workstations are running an outdated operating system (Windows 7), which is no longer supported with security updates, making them highly vulnerable to known exploits.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Anonymous FTP Access Allowed",
                        "Overview": "The Nmap scan identified an FTP server (vsftpd 2.3.4) on port 21 that allows anonymous login. This means unauthorized users can access and potentially modify files on the FTP server without credentials. This can lead to data leakage, unauthorized file uploads (e.g., malware distribution), or defacement of content. The vulnerability was identified by the 'ftp-anon' Nmap script output.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "FTP Server (vsftpd 2.3.4)",
                            "Port 21"

                    {
                        "Risk": "No MFA for Computer Logins",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised through phishing, keyloggers, or brute-force attacks. Relying solely on a single factor (password) is insufficient to protect against modern credential-based threats. This was identified from the organizational data.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or annually for all employees. This leaves employees vulnerable to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting), malware, and poor security practices, significantly increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents and breaches. This was identified from the organizational data.",
                        "Severity": "High",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Outdated Operating System",
                        "Overview": "Computers are running Windows 7, which is an end-of-life operating system. This means it no longer receives critical security updates, making systems highly vulnerable to known and newly discovered exploits. The impact is severe, potentially leading to system compromise, data breaches, and loss of productivity. This was identified from the provided current risks.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Workstations"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately disable anonymous FTP access on the vsftpd server and ensure all FTP services are properly secured with strong authentication and access controls. Furthermore, implement mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to significantly enhance protection against credential theft. Establish and enforce a comprehensive security awareness training program for all new employees and conduct annual refresher training for the entire staff to educate them on common cyber threats and best security practices. Finally, prioritize upgrading all workstations from Windows 7 to a currently supported operating system like Windows 10 or 11 to ensure they receive vital security updates and patches.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces several critical and high-severity vulnerabilities, primarily stemming from an insecure FTP configuration, a lack of robust authentication mechanisms for computer access, insufficient employee security training, and the use of an outdated operating system. While an acceptable use policy is in place, the absence of key security controls and awareness programs significantly diminishes the organization's overall readiness against modern cyber threats. Addressing these issues promptly is crucial to prevent potential data breaches, unauthorized access, and operational disruptions."
