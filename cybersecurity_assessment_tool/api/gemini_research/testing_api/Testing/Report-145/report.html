        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an Nginx web server (version 1.18.0) running on port 443 (HTTPS). Organizational data indicates significant gaps in foundational security practices, including a lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, absence of an employee acceptable use policy, and no security awareness training programs for new or existing employees. While MFA is required for sensitive data systems, the lack thereof in other critical access points presents considerable risk.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. A successful compromise could lead to data breaches, business email compromise (BEC) scams, and further network penetration. This was identified directly from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This vulnerability allows attackers to gain access to internal systems with just a username and password, making systems highly susceptible to credential theft attacks. Compromised computer access can lead to lateral movement within the network, data exfiltration, and deployment of malware. This was identified directly from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines, employees may engage in activities that inadvertently introduce security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive data. This increases the likelihood of malware infections, data leaks, and compliance violations. This was identified directly from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering attacks due to their unfamiliarity with organizational security protocols and common threats. This oversight leaves the organization vulnerable to phishing, malware, and other human-factor exploits from the moment an employee joins. This was identified directly from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Annual Security Awareness Training for All Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. Regular training is crucial to keep employees informed about evolving threats, reinforce best practices, and maintain a strong security culture. The absence of annual training leads to a decay in security knowledge and an increased susceptibility to various cyberattacks over time. This was identified directly from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Nginx Web Server Version - <span class="severity-Low">Low</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nginx web server is running version 1.18.0. While not immediately identified with critical, publicly known vulnerabilities, running older software versions generally increases the attack surface as newer versions often include security patches for previously discovered flaws. Maintaining an outdated server can expose the organization to potential exploits that have been patched in later releases. This was identified during the network scan.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Nginx web server (version 1.18.0)</li><li>Port 443</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, immediate implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and computer logins is strongly recommended. Furthermore, the organization must develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to guide appropriate conduct and minimize internal risks. Establishing mandatory security awareness training programs for all new employees, as well as annual refresher training for all staff, is critical to building a resilient human firewall against social engineering and other threats. Finally, the Nginx web server should be updated to the latest stable version to benefit from the most recent security patches and performance improvements.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The current cybersecurity assessment reveals a critical lack of fundamental security controls, particularly concerning Multi-Factor Authentication for email and computer access, and the absence of essential security policies and training programs. While MFA is in place for sensitive data systems, the broader organizational readiness is low, leaving the organization highly vulnerable to common cyber threats. Addressing these identified vulnerabilities through the recommended actions is paramount to mitigating significant risks and establishing a more robust security foundation.</p>
