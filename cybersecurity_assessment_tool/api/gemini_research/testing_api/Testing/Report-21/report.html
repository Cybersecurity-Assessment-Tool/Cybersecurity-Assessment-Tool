        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network includes an open port 8080, which, according to a previous assessment, is considered secure despite its title. On the organizational front, a strong foundation is present with an acceptable use policy and consistent security awareness training for all employees. However, a significant security gap exists due to the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing employee email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to email in the event of compromised credentials (e.g., via phishing or brute-force attacks). Email accounts often contain sensitive information and can be used as a pivot point for further attacks, leading to data exfiltration or business email compromise.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li><li>Communication channels</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not mandated for logging into organizational computers. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are stolen or guessed. A compromised computer can lead to data breaches, malware propagation, and network lateral movement, potentially granting attackers a foothold within the internal network.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Servers (if direct login is permitted)</li><li>Network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing systems containing sensitive data. This is a critical security gap, as it means that a single set of compromised credentials could grant an attacker direct access to the organization's most valuable information assets. This could lead to severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, significant financial losses, and severe reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>Cloud storage solutions</li><li>CRM/ERP systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points. Prioritize the deployment of MFA for sensitive data systems, followed by computer logins and email access. Evaluate and select a robust MFA solution that integrates seamlessly with existing identity management systems and provides a user-friendly experience. Additionally, conduct targeted training for employees to educate them on the importance of MFA and provide clear instructions on its effective use. Regularly review and update security policies to ensure comprehensive MFA enforcement across all relevant systems and applications.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security through its acceptable use policy and regular security awareness training. However, a critical vulnerability exists in the widespread absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. This significantly elevates the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. Addressing these MFA gaps is paramount to enhancing the organization's overall security posture and readiness against modern cyber threats, moving towards a more resilient and secure operational environment.</p>
