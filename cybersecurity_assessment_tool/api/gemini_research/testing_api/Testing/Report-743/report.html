        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization exhibits a foundational level of cybersecurity readiness, with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) implemented for computer logins and sensitive data systems, an established acceptable use policy, and consistent security awareness training for all employees. However, a network scan identified an open SSH port (22), and a critical vulnerability related to 'Localhost Exposed' was noted. A significant gap in the security posture is the absence of MFA for email access, which poses a substantial risk.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A critical vulnerability was identified where the localhost appears to be exposed, potentially allowing unauthorized access to internal services or data. This could lead to severe impacts such as data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service. The exact method of identification is not detailed, but its critical severity indicates a significant and immediate threat.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not currently require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly elevates the risk of account compromise through common attack vectors like phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. A successful compromise of an employee's email could lead to further internal attacks, impersonation, or unauthorized access to sensitive information. This vulnerability was identified through a review of organizational security policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port (22) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A network scan revealed an open SSH port (22) on a host within the network. While SSH is a legitimate and necessary service for remote administration, an open port represents a potential attack surface. Without proper hardening, it can be vulnerable to brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or exploitation of unpatched SSH vulnerabilities, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the host. This was identified via Nmap scan data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with port 22 open</li><li>SSH service</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, immediate action is required for the 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability, including a thorough investigation to understand its scope and implementing network segmentation and strict access controls. For email security, it is strongly recommended to implement mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts across the organization to protect against credential theft and phishing. Regarding the open SSH port, ensure that SSH services are configured with strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., key-based authentication, disabling password authentication), implement rate limiting, and restrict access to only trusted IP ranges. Regular patching of SSH servers and continuous monitoring of logs for suspicious activity are also crucial. The organization should continue its existing security awareness training and acceptable use policies, and regularly review and update security policies to adapt to evolving threat landscapes.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization's current cybersecurity posture is a mix of strengths and critical weaknesses. While robust in areas such as MFA for sensitive systems and employee security training, the presence of a 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability and the absence of MFA for email access represent significant and immediate risks. The open SSH port also warrants attention to prevent potential unauthorized access. Addressing these identified vulnerabilities is paramount to enhancing the overall cybersecurity readiness, reducing the attack surface, and safeguarding organizational assets against potential cyber threats.</p>
