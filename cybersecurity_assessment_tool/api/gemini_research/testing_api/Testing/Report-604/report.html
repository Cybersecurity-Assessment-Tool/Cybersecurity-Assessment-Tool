        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization currently lacks fundamental security controls, particularly in user authentication and employee training. While the provided network scan data is minimal and shows no immediately apparent open ports, indicating a potentially locked-down external perimeter, the internal security posture is significantly weakened by the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and comprehensive security awareness training. The organization does have an acceptable use policy in place, which is a positive step, but its effectiveness is diminished without accompanying training and robust technical controls.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email, logging into computers, or accessing sensitive data systems. This critical oversight significantly elevates the risk of unauthorized access. If an attacker obtains user credentials through phishing, malware, or other means, they can gain full access to these systems without an additional layer of verification. This vulnerability can lead to data breaches, intellectual property theft, financial fraud, and severe reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email systems</li><li>User login systems (computers)</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees, nor does it provide annual training for all employees. This lack of ongoing education leaves the workforce highly susceptible to social engineering attacks, such as phishing, pretexting, and malware. Employees who are unaware of common cyber threats and best security practices are more likely to inadvertently compromise organizational security, acting as an unintentional entry point for attackers. This increases the overall likelihood of successful cyberattacks and data incidents.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, immediate implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points is paramount. This includes email systems, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, providing a crucial additional layer of security against credential theft. Concurrently, a comprehensive security awareness training program must be established. This program should include mandatory training for all new employees upon onboarding and annual refresher training for all staff. Training should cover topics such as identifying phishing attempts, strong password practices, data handling protocols, and recognizing social engineering tactics. Regular simulated phishing exercises can also help reinforce training and identify areas for improvement. Furthermore, while an acceptable use policy is in place, its effectiveness should be regularly reviewed and communicated to employees as part of the training program.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication and a lack of comprehensive security awareness training. While the network perimeter appears to be minimally exposed based on the provided scan data, the internal security controls and human element represent critical vulnerabilities. Without addressing these fundamental weaknesses, the organization remains highly susceptible to various cyber threats, including data breaches and unauthorized system access. Implementing the recommended security measures is essential to improve the overall security readiness and protect critical assets.</p>
