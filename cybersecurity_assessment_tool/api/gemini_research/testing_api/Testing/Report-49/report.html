        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization operates a network with an Nginx web server (version 1.18.0) exposed on port 443 (HTTPS). Internally, the organization lacks multi-factor authentication (MFA) for email access and computer logins, although MFA is used for sensitive data systems. Furthermore, there is no employee acceptable use policy in place, and security awareness training is not conducted for new employees or annually for all staff.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require multi-factor authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. Compromised email accounts can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and further network penetration.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-factor authentication is not required for employees to log into their computers. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are stolen or guessed. A compromised workstation can serve as a pivot point for attackers to move laterally within the network, access sensitive data, or deploy malware.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Nginx Web Server - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nginx web server running on port 443 is version 1.18.0. This version was released in 2020 and is significantly outdated. Older software versions often contain known vulnerabilities (CVEs) that have been patched in newer releases. An attacker could exploit these known vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access, perform denial-of-service attacks, or compromise the web server and potentially the underlying system.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Web server (Nginx 1.18.0)</li><li>Port 443</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy (AUP). Without a clear AUP, employees may be unaware of their responsibilities regarding the use of company IT resources, data handling, and internet usage. This can lead to risky behaviors, accidental data breaches, and non-compliance with security best practices, increasing the overall attack surface.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>IT systems</li><li>Data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training. This means new hires may not be equipped with the necessary knowledge to identify and respond to common cyber threats like phishing, social engineering, or malware. This oversight can make new employees easy targets for attackers, potentially introducing vulnerabilities into the organization from day one.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Annual Security Awareness Training for All Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. Regular training is crucial to keep employees updated on evolving threats, reinforce security best practices, and maintain a strong security culture. Without it, employees' security knowledge can degrade over time, increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, the organization should immediately implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all email access and computer logins to significantly enhance credential security. The Nginx web server should be updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities and improve overall security. Furthermore, it is critical to develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to guide employee behavior regarding IT resources. Finally, a robust security awareness training program must be established, including mandatory training for all new employees and annual refresher training for all staff, to foster a security-conscious culture and reduce human-related risks.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to a lack of fundamental security controls and policies. The absence of MFA for email and computer logins, coupled with an outdated web server, presents critical technical vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. Furthermore, the lack of an acceptable use policy and comprehensive security awareness training indicates a gap in organizational security posture, leaving the human element susceptible to social engineering and other threats. Addressing these deficiencies is paramount to improving the organization's overall security readiness and protecting its assets from potential cyberattacks.</p>
