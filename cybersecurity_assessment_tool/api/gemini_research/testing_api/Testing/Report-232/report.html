        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a robust security posture regarding network perimeter defense, with no open ports identified during the network scan. Furthermore, the organization has implemented strong multi-factor authentication (MFA) requirements for accessing email, logging into computers, and accessing sensitive data systems. Regular security awareness training is conducted for both new and existing employees, indicating a commitment to human-centric security. However, a significant gap exists in the absence of a formal employee acceptable use policy.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). An AUP is a critical document that defines acceptable and unacceptable behaviors when using organizational IT resources, data, and systems. Without a clear AUP, employees may inadvertently engage in activities that pose security risks, such as improper data handling, unauthorized software installation, or misuse of company assets. This absence increases the risk of insider threats, data breaches, and potential non-compliance with industry regulations. This vulnerability was identified through the review of the organization's provided policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employees</li><li>Organizational IT Resources</li><li>Data Systems</li><li>Company Assets</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>It is strongly recommended that the organization immediately develop and implement a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). This policy should clearly outline expectations for employee behavior regarding IT resource usage, data handling, internet browsing, software installation, and security protocols. Once developed, all employees must be thoroughly trained on the AUP, and their acknowledgment of understanding and compliance should be formally documented. The organization should continue to enforce its strong MFA policies across all critical access points and maintain its schedule of regular security awareness training for all employees to reinforce best practices and policy adherence.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization exhibits commendable strengths in its network perimeter security, multi-factor authentication implementation, and security awareness training programs, the absence of an Employee Acceptable Use Policy represents a notable vulnerability. Addressing this policy gap is crucial for establishing clear behavioral guidelines, mitigating insider risks, and strengthening the overall security posture and readiness of the organization.</p>
