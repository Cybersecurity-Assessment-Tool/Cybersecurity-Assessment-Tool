        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to access control by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. An employee acceptable use policy is also in place, indicating a foundational level of governance. However, a significant gap exists in security awareness training, as neither new nor existing employees receive regular training. Network scanning revealed an open SSH port (22), which, while a common service, presents a potential attack surface if not adequately secured.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or annually for all employees. This significantly increases the risk of successful phishing attacks, social engineering, and malware infections, as employees may not be equipped to identify and respond to common cyber threats. Human error is a leading cause of security breaches, and without proper training, employees become the weakest link in the security chain. This was identified directly from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port (22) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH port (22) was detected on a host within the network. While SSH is a legitimate and widely used protocol for secure remote access, an open port without proper hardening and monitoring can be exploited by attackers attempting brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or exploiting SSH vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access. If compromised, an attacker could gain remote control over the affected system, leading to data exfiltration, lateral movement, or further network compromise. This was identified via the Nmap scan data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with open port 22</li><li>Network perimeter</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>It is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement a comprehensive security awareness training program. This program should include mandatory training for all new hires and annual refresher training for all existing employees, covering topics such as phishing, social engineering, password hygiene, and data handling best practices. Additionally, a thorough review of the host with the open SSH port (22) is critical. Implement best practices for SSH security, including disabling password authentication in favor of key-based authentication, enforcing strong password policies for any remaining password-based access, disabling root login, implementing rate limiting, and ensuring SSH servers are regularly patched and configured with the principle of least privilege. Consider restricting SSH access to only necessary IP addresses or internal networks via firewall rules.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization has established a good foundation with MFA implementation and an acceptable use policy. However, the absence of regular security awareness training for employees represents a critical vulnerability that significantly elevates the risk of human-factor incidents. Furthermore, the presence of an open SSH port requires immediate attention to ensure it is properly secured and monitored. Addressing these areas will substantially improve the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and readiness against common threat vectors.</p>
