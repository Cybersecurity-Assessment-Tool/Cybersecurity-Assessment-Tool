        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open SSH port (22), indicating potential external exposure. While the organization demonstrates good practices in security awareness training for all employees and maintains an acceptable use policy, critical gaps exist in access control. Specifically, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not enforced for email access or for systems containing sensitive data, posing significant risks to data confidentiality and integrity. MFA is currently only required for computer logins.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Service Exposure - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An internal service, potentially running on localhost, has been identified as externally accessible. This could allow unauthorized access to internal systems and data, bypassing perimeter defenses. The Nmap scan also indicates an open SSH port (22), which, if not properly secured, could exacerbate this risk by providing a direct entry point.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Internal IP Addresses</li><li>SSH Service (Port 22)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks. If an attacker gains access to an employee's email, they could potentially reset passwords for other services, access sensitive communications, or launch further attacks.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee Email Accounts</li><li>Email System</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not mandated for logging into systems containing sensitive data. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are compromised. Attackers could gain direct access to sensitive information, leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and significant reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive Data Systems</li><li>User Accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately investigate and secure any exposed localhost services and the open SSH port (22), ensuring they are not accessible from unauthorized networks. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all employee email accounts to prevent unauthorized access and reduce the impact of credential compromise. Crucially, MFA must be enforced for all systems that store or process sensitive data to protect against data breaches. Regularly review network configurations and access controls to prevent inadvertent exposure of internal services and ensure all critical systems are adequately protected.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces critical vulnerabilities related to exposed services and, more significantly, a lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for email and sensitive data systems. While security awareness training and acceptable use policies are in place, these technical control deficiencies represent substantial risks that could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and operational disruption. Addressing these MFA gaps and securing exposed services are paramount to improving the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and readiness.</p>
