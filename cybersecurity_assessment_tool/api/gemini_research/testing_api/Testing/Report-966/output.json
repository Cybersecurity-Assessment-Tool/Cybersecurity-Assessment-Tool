            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and conducts annual security awareness training for all employees. However, significant gaps exist in the security posture, including the absence of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, and a lack of security awareness training for new employees. A network assessment identified a critical vulnerability related to an unencrypted web server, specifically port 80 being open, which poses a risk of unencrypted data transmission.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Unencrypted Web Server",
                        "Overview": "This risk indicates that port 80 is open, suggesting the presence of a web server that could be serving content over unencrypted HTTP. This allows for the interception of sensitive data, credentials, or other information transmitted between the server and clients. The vulnerability was identified through a security assessment.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Port 80"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is recommended to immediately close port 80 if an unencrypted web server is not intentionally running. If a web server is required, it should be configured to use HTTPS with a valid SSL/TLS certificate to encrypt all traffic, redirecting all HTTP traffic to HTTPS. Furthermore, the organization should implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and access to sensitive data systems to significantly enhance access control. Establishing security awareness training for all new employees is crucial to ensure they understand security best practices from day one.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security with MFA for email and annual security training. However, critical gaps exist in MFA implementation for computers and sensitive data, as well as in initial security training for new hires. The presence of an unencrypted web server on port 80 represents a direct risk of data interception. Addressing these vulnerabilities and strengthening security protocols, particularly around MFA and web server encryption, is essential to improve the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and readiness against potential threats."
