        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, and maintaining an employee acceptable use policy. Annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees. However, a critical gap exists as new employees do not receive initial security awareness training. Network scans revealed an open SSH port (22), which, while common, requires robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A critical vulnerability where a service or system is exposed to the localhost interface. This could potentially allow unauthorized access or privilege escalation if other services on the same host are compromised, or if the system is misconfigured to allow external access to localhost-bound services. The high CVSS score of 10.0 indicates maximum impact, potentially leading to complete system compromise.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Local system IP interface</li><li>Specific service bound to localhost</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port (22) - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The network scan identified an open SSH port (22). While SSH is a legitimate service for remote administration, an open port presents a potential attack surface for brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or exploitation of SSH vulnerabilities if not properly secured. Unauthorized access to SSH can lead to full system compromise.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Network perimeter</li><li>Server hosting SSH service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of New Employee Security Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. This leaves new hires vulnerable to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) and unaware of critical security policies and best practices from day one. This significantly increases the risk of human error leading to security incidents, data breaches, or malware infections.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li><li>Data integrity and confidentiality</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Investigate the "Localhost Exposed" vulnerability immediately. Ensure that services intended for localhost access are strictly bound to the loopback interface and cannot be accessed externally. Review firewall rules and service configurations to prevent any unintended exposure. Implement robust security measures for the open SSH port (22), including disabling password authentication in favor of key-based authentication, enforcing strong passphrases for SSH keys, implementing rate limiting and IP whitelisting, regularly patching SSH servers, and monitoring SSH access logs for suspicious activity. Develop and implement mandatory security awareness training for all new employees as part of their onboarding process. This training should cover essential security policies, common threat vectors (like phishing), password best practices, and incident reporting procedures to ensure they are security-aware from their first day. Continue regular network and system vulnerability scanning to identify and remediate new exposures promptly.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization has established a foundational security posture with strong MFA implementation and an acceptable use policy, complemented by annual security awareness training. However, critical vulnerabilities such as an exposed localhost service and an open SSH port require immediate technical remediation to reduce the attack surface. Furthermore, the absence of initial security awareness training for new employees represents a significant human factor risk that must be addressed to prevent early-stage security incidents. Proactive measures in these areas are crucial for enhancing the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and resilience against evolving threats.</p>
