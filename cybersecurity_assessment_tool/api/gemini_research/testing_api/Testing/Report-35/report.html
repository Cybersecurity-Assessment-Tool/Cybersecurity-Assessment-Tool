        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization currently employs Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems, which is a positive security measure. They also conduct security awareness training for both new hires and all employees annually. However, a significant gap exists as MFA is not required for computer logins. Furthermore, the organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. Network scanning revealed an open SSH port (22) on a host, presenting a potential attack vector. A critical vulnerability related to localhost exposure was also identified, indicating a severe internal access risk.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The system's localhost interface is exposed, potentially allowing unauthorized access to services running on the local machine. This is a critical vulnerability as it can bypass network firewalls and directly access internal services, leading to data compromise or system control.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication, making endpoints vulnerable to various attacks.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee Workstations</li><li>Servers (if applicable)</li><li>Login Portals</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This means there are no formal guidelines for employees regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, data handling, and security practices. This absence can lead to misuse, data breaches, and compliance issues due to a lack of clear expectations and accountability.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Organizational Policies</li><li>Employee Conduct</li><li>Data Handling Procedures</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port (22) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH (port 22) was detected on a host. While SSH is a legitimate service for secure remote access, an open port presents a potential attack surface for brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or exploitation of SSH vulnerabilities if not properly secured. Without strong authentication and restricted access, this port could be an entry point for attackers.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with open port 22</li><li>SSH Service</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins, thereby protecting endpoints from credential theft. A comprehensive employee acceptable use policy must be developed and enforced to establish clear guidelines for IT resource usage, data handling, and security best practices, mitigating human-factor risks. For the identified open SSH port (22), ensure it is secured with strong, key-based authentication, disable password authentication, and restrict access to trusted IP addresses only. Regular patching and updating of SSH services are also crucial. The critical localhost exposure must be addressed by implementing proper network segmentation and access controls to prevent unauthorized access to internal services and sensitive data.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to cybersecurity through the use of MFA for critical systems and regular security awareness training. However, several significant vulnerabilities persist, including the absence of MFA for computer logins, a lack of a formal acceptable use policy, an open SSH port, and a critical localhost exposure. Addressing these identified risks is paramount to reducing the overall attack surface, strengthening the organization's defenses, and achieving a more robust security posture against evolving cyber threats.</p>
