        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and computer logins, alongside an acceptable use policy and annual security awareness training for all employees. However, critical gaps exist in the security posture. Specifically, MFA is not required for access to sensitive data systems, and new employees do not receive security awareness training upon onboarding. A network scan identified one active host with port 80 (HTTP) open, indicating a potential web service that requires further investigation for security hardening and encryption.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or other means. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to sensitive data, leading to data breaches, compliance violations, and reputational damage. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often the most vulnerable to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) due to unfamiliarity with organizational security policies, common threats, and secure practices. This gap leaves the organization susceptible to initial compromise through human error, potentially leading to malware infections, credential theft, or unauthorized access. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open Port 80 (HTTP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An Nmap scan identified an open port 80 (HTTP) on a host within the network. While HTTP itself is not inherently a vulnerability, an unencrypted web service can expose sensitive information in transit, be vulnerable to various web application attacks (e.g., Cross-Site Scripting, SQL injection) if not properly secured, or indicate an outdated/unpatched web server. Without further inspection, this represents a potential entry point or information leakage vector. This vulnerability was identified through the network scan data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with open port 80</li><li>Web server application</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems immediately. This will significantly enhance protection against credential compromise. Furthermore, establish a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees as part of their onboarding process to educate them on common threats and secure practices. Finally, conduct a thorough review of the service running on port 80. If it is a web server, ensure it is fully patched, securely configured, and consider migrating to HTTPS to encrypt all traffic. If the service is not essential, the port should be closed to reduce the attack surface.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently exhibits a mixed security posture. While good practices like MFA for email and computer logins, along with annual security training, are in place, critical vulnerabilities exist concerning sensitive data access and new employee security awareness. The presence of an open HTTP port also warrants immediate attention. Addressing these identified gaps is crucial for strengthening the overall security framework, reducing the risk of data breaches, and ensuring a more resilient defense against cyber threats.</p>
