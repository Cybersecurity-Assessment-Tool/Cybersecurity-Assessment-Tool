        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open MySQL port (3306), indicating a potential database exposure. From an organizational security posture perspective, while the organization requires MFA for computer logins and has an acceptable use policy and security awareness training for new employees, there are critical gaps. Specifically, MFA is not required for email access or sensitive data systems, and annual security awareness training for all employees is not conducted, leaving significant vulnerabilities related to credential compromise and human error.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The MySQL port 3306 is openly accessible on the network. This direct exposure of a database service significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or denial-of-service attacks if the database is not adequately secured or patched. This vulnerability was identified through network scanning.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for accessing email. Email accounts are frequently targeted by phishing and credential stuffing attacks. Without MFA, compromised credentials can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive communications, impersonation, and potential lateral movement within the organization's network. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for logging into sensitive data systems. Direct access to systems containing sensitive information without an additional layer of authentication significantly elevates the risk of data breaches if user credentials are compromised. This could result in severe financial penalties, reputational damage, and regulatory non-compliance. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. Without regular, mandatory training, employees may not be aware of the latest cybersecurity threats, best practices, and organizational policies, increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents such as successful phishing attacks or malware infections. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement robust firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted internal IP addresses or via a Virtual Private Network (VPN) for remote access. Crucially, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be enforced for all email access and sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are stolen. Furthermore, the organization should establish and enforce a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees to ensure they are continuously updated on current threats and best security practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant security vulnerabilities, particularly concerning database exposure and critical gaps in multi-factor authentication for email and sensitive data systems. While some foundational security practices are in place, the lack of comprehensive MFA and annual security awareness training for all employees indicates a moderate to high readiness gap. Addressing these issues promptly is essential to enhance the overall security posture and protect against potential data breaches and unauthorized access.</p>
