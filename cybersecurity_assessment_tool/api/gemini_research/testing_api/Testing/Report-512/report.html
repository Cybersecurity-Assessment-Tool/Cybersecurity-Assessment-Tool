        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan identified an open HTTP port (80), indicating a web service operating without encryption. Organizational data reveals significant security gaps, primarily the complete absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. While an acceptable use policy is in place and new employees receive security awareness training, there is no annual security awareness training for all employees. These findings suggest a critical lack of foundational security controls, leaving the organization highly vulnerable to various cyber threats, including unauthorized access, data breaches, and social engineering attacks.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for email access. This significantly increases the risk of email account compromise through credential stuffing, phishing, or brute-force attacks. A compromised email account can serve as a pivot point for attackers to gain further access to internal systems, exfiltrate data, or conduct business email compromise (BEC) scams. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>User accounts</li><li>Organizational data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MFA is not required for logging into computers. This exposes employee workstations and potentially the entire internal network to unauthorized access if user credentials are stolen, guessed, or phished. Without an additional authentication factor, an attacker with valid credentials can easily gain access to an employee's machine, facilitating lateral movement and access to sensitive resources. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee computers</li><li>Internal network access</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce MFA for access to sensitive data systems. This represents a critical risk, as it allows direct access to confidential or proprietary information with only a single factor of authentication. If an attacker obtains credentials for these systems, they can bypass security measures and exfiltrate sensitive data, leading to severe financial, reputational, and regulatory consequences. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>File shares</li><li>Proprietary information</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open HTTP Port (80) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A network scan revealed an open HTTP port (80) on a host. This indicates that a web server or service is running without encryption. All traffic transmitted over HTTP is unencrypted and susceptible to eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attacks, and session hijacking. Depending on the content served, this could expose sensitive information or provide an unsecure entry point for attackers. This vulnerability was identified through the Nmap network scan.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Web server on port 80</li><li>Network traffic</li><li>Client-server communications</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This lack of recurring training means employees may not be updated on the latest cyber threats, phishing techniques, or social engineering tactics. Over time, awareness can wane, increasing the likelihood of employees falling victim to human-factor attacks, which can lead to malware infections or credential compromise. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li><li>Human factor vulnerabilities</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, immediate implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is paramount across all critical access points. This includes enforcing MFA for email access, computer logins, and especially for all sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the open HTTP port (80) should be addressed by migrating any web services to HTTPS (port 443) with a valid SSL/TLS certificate to encrypt all traffic. If the service is not required externally, it should be restricted to internal network access only. Finally, the organization must establish and enforce a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees to ensure continuous education on evolving cyber threats and best practices, complementing the existing new employee training.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The current cybersecurity assessment reveals a critical state of readiness, primarily due to the complete absence of Multi-Factor Authentication across key access points and the presence of an unencrypted web service. While some foundational elements like an acceptable use policy and initial security training are in place, the lack of comprehensive MFA and ongoing security education leaves the organization highly susceptible to a wide range of cyberattacks, including data breaches and unauthorized system access. Addressing these vulnerabilities with urgency is crucial to mitigate significant risks and establish a more robust security posture.</p>
