        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan indicated that no common web ports (like 80) were found open. However, a separate assessment identified a potential unencrypted web server on Port 80. The organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and sensitive data systems, which are strong security practices. Conversely, MFA is not required for email access, posing a significant risk for account compromise. Furthermore, the organization lacks security awareness training for both new and existing employees, which is a critical gap in their human firewall defenses. An acceptable use policy is in place.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unencrypted Web Server - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Port 80 is open, indicating an unencrypted web server. This allows sensitive data transmitted over this port to be intercepted and read by unauthorized parties, leading to data breaches and privacy violations. This vulnerability was identified through a security assessment.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of email account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing, as a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to an employee's email. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or annually for all employees. This leaves employees vulnerable to social engineering attacks, phishing, malware, and other common threats, as they may not be equipped to recognize and report suspicious activities. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data and systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts immediately to prevent unauthorized access. For the unencrypted web server, Port 80 should be closed if not actively used, or secured with SSL/TLS encryption if it hosts any web services. Furthermore, a comprehensive security awareness training program must be established for all new hires and conducted annually for all employees to educate them on current threats and best security practices. Regular training will significantly strengthen the organization's human firewall against social engineering and phishing attacks.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates some strong security practices, such as MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, and an acceptable use policy. However, critical vulnerabilities exist, including the lack of MFA for email and the complete absence of security awareness training. These gaps expose the organization to significant risks of account compromise and successful social engineering attacks. Addressing these areas is paramount to improving the overall cybersecurity posture and readiness against prevalent threats.</p>
