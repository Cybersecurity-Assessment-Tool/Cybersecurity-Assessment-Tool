        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The provided network scan data is minimal, indicating either no specific target was provided or no open ports were identified on the scanned host. Therefore, this assessment primarily focuses on the organizational security policies and practices. The organization currently lacks several fundamental security controls, particularly concerning Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for critical access points and comprehensive security awareness training for employees. While MFA is used for sensitive data systems, its absence for email and computer logins represents significant vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the lack of an Acceptable Use Policy and consistent security training exposes the organization to increased human-factor risks and potential compliance issues.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to email through credential stuffing, phishing, or brute-force attacks. A compromised email account can serve as a gateway for further attacks, including business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and lateral movement within the network. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' to MFA for email access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email accounts</li><li>User credentials</li><li>Organizational communication</li><li>Sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This leaves user workstations and potentially internal network resources vulnerable to unauthorized access if a user's primary credentials (username and password) are compromised. Without a second factor, a single compromised credential can grant an attacker direct access to an employee's machine and potentially the internal network. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' to MFA for computer logins.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>User workstations</li><li>Network access</li><li>Internal systems</li><li>Sensitive data on endpoints</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of an Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not have an employee acceptable use policy (AUP). Without a clear AUP, employees may be unaware of their responsibilities regarding the use of company IT resources, internet access, data handling, and security best practices. This lack of guidance can lead to misuse of company assets, increased risk of malware infections, data leaks, and potential non-compliance with industry regulations. This was identified by the organizational data stating 'No' to having an AUP.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Data integrity</li><li>Legal and regulatory compliance</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering attacks, such as phishing, as they may not be familiar with the company's specific security protocols, common threats, or reporting procedures. This lack of initial training leaves them vulnerable and can introduce significant risks to the organization's overall security posture. This was identified by the organizational data stating 'No' to security awareness training for new employees.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li><li>Susceptibility to social engineering attacks</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Regular Security Awareness Training for All Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. Security threats and attack vectors are constantly evolving. Without regular, updated training, employees' knowledge of current threats and best practices can become outdated, increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents, such as falling for advanced phishing scams or mishandling sensitive information. This was identified by the organizational data stating 'No' to annual security awareness training.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li><li>Adaptability to evolving cyber threats</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance its security posture, the organization should prioritize the implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and computer logins. This is a critical step to protect against credential-based attacks. Concurrently, a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) must be developed and enforced to clearly define employee responsibilities regarding IT asset usage and data handling. Furthermore, a robust security awareness training program should be established, including mandatory training for all new employees and annual refresher courses for all staff. This will empower employees to recognize and respond to threats effectively, reducing the organization's susceptibility to social engineering and human error.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant security risks primarily due to the absence of critical foundational controls. While MFA is utilized for sensitive data systems, the lack of MFA for email and computer logins, coupled with the absence of an AUP and consistent security awareness training, creates substantial vulnerabilities. Addressing these gaps is paramount to protecting organizational assets, data, and maintaining a resilient cybersecurity posture against common and evolving threats. The current readiness is low, but can be significantly improved with the recommended policy and technology implementations.</p>
