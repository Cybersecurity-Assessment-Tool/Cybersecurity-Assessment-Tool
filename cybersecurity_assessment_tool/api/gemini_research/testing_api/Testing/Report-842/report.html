        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network includes an FTP service (vsftpd 2.3.4) with an open port allowing anonymous login. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required for email and computer logins, it is not mandated for access to sensitive data systems. The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy, which could lead to inconsistent security practices. On a positive note, security awareness training is provided for both new and all employees annually. However, a significant number of workstations are still operating on Windows 7, an end-of-life operating system.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Anonymous FTP Access - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nmap scan identified an open FTP service (vsftpd 2.3.4) on port 21, which allows anonymous login. This poses a critical risk as unauthorized users could potentially access, upload, or modify files, leading to data breaches, data integrity issues, or the introduction of malicious content. The specific version vsftpd 2.3.4 is also known to have several vulnerabilities, including a backdoor, further escalating the risk.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>FTP server (vsftpd 2.3.4)</li><li>Port 21</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Operating System - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Several workstations are running Windows 7, an operating system that has reached its end-of-life. This means it no longer receives security updates or patches from Microsoft, leaving systems highly vulnerable to new exploits, malware, and other cyber threats. Continued use significantly increases the risk of system compromise and data loss.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations running Windows 7</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if credentials are compromised through phishing, keylogging, or brute-force attacks. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant full access to sensitive data, leading to potential data breaches.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This absence means there are no formal guidelines or rules for how employees should use company IT resources, including networks, devices, and data. This can lead to inconsistent security practices, increased risk of misuse, data leakage, and non-compliance with industry regulations, as employees may unknowingly engage in risky behaviors.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>IT resources</li><li>Company data</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is critical to immediately disable anonymous FTP access and, if FTP functionality is necessary, implement secure alternatives like SFTP or FTPS with strong authentication, ensuring the service is updated to a supported version. All workstations running Windows 7 must be prioritized for upgrade to a currently supported operating system (e.g., Windows 10 or 11); if immediate upgrades are not feasible, these machines should be isolated from the main network with strict access controls. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be mandated for all access to sensitive data systems to add a crucial layer of security against credential compromise. Furthermore, a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy should be developed, clearly defining expectations for IT resource usage, data handling, internet browsing, and email, and effectively communicated to all employees. Regular security audits, including vulnerability scans and penetration tests, should be conducted to proactively identify and remediate new and existing security weaknesses, alongside establishing a robust patch management program to ensure all software, operating systems, and network devices are kept up-to-date with the latest security patches.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security through MFA for general logins and regular security awareness training. However, significant vulnerabilities, including an anonymous FTP server, outdated Windows 7 workstations, and the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems, pose critical risks to data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The lack of an acceptable use policy further indicates a governance gap that could lead to inconsistent security practices. Addressing these identified risks is paramount to improving the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and readiness against evolving threats, ensuring a more secure operational environment.</p>
