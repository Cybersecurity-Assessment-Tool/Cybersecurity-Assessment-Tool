        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan identified an open port 8080, which was initially flagged with a 'TOP SECRET DB' title, but has been confirmed as secured and a false positive. However, a review of organizational data reveals significant gaps in foundational security practices. Specifically, the organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access or computer logins, which are critical controls for preventing unauthorized access. Furthermore, there is an absence of an employee acceptable use policy and a lack of security awareness training for new employees, indicating weaknesses in security governance and human element defenses. While MFA is required for sensitive data systems, the broader lack of MFA implementation and security policies presents considerable risks.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Email Security (No MFA) - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts if credentials are stolen or phished. Compromised email accounts can lead to further attacks, data breaches, and impersonation.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Computer Login Security (No MFA) - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if local or domain credentials are compromised, potentially allowing attackers to gain a foothold within the internal network.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network access</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines, employees may engage in activities that pose security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling company data, leading to potential data breaches, malware infections, or compliance violations.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering attacks and may be unaware of specific organizational security protocols, increasing the risk of human error leading to security incidents.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open Port 8080 (Confirmed Secure) - <span class="severity-Info">Info</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An Nmap scan identified port 8080 as open, displaying the title 'TOP SECRET DB'. However, further investigation (as per provided current risks) confirms this port is secured and is a false positive or already mitigated, posing no immediate threat.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li><li>'TOP SECRET DB' service</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and computer logins to significantly enhance credential security. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to establish clear guidelines for secure behavior and data handling. Furthermore, establish a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees to ensure they are equipped with essential cybersecurity knowledge from day one, complementing the existing annual training for all staff. Regularly review and update security policies and training content to address evolving threats.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant vulnerabilities primarily due to the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for email and computer logins, and gaps in foundational security policies and new employee training. While the identified open port 8080 has been confirmed as secure, the human and access control elements present critical areas for improvement. Addressing these issues through policy implementation, technology controls, and continuous employee education is crucial for enhancing the overall cybersecurity posture and readiness against common attack vectors.</p>
