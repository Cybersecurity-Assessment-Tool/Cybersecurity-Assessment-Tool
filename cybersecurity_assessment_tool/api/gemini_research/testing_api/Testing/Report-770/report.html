        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network exhibits several critical security vulnerabilities and a general lack of fundamental security controls. A network scan revealed an open FTP service (vsftpd 2.3.4) allowing anonymous login, posing a severe risk of unauthorized data access and potential system compromise. Furthermore, the organization lacks multi-factor authentication (MFA) for critical access points including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, significantly increasing the risk of credential-based attacks. Compounding these issues, there is no formal security awareness training for new or existing employees, leaving the human element highly susceptible to social engineering. Finally, the presence of outdated Windows 7 workstations introduces unpatched vulnerabilities, making these systems easy targets for exploitation. While an acceptable use policy is in place, the absence of other critical security measures creates a highly vulnerable environment.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Anonymous FTP Access - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nmap scan identified an open FTP service (vsftpd 2.3.4) on port 21 that allows anonymous login. This configuration can lead to unauthorized access to files, data leakage, and potential for attackers to upload malicious content, severely compromising data confidentiality and integrity. This was identified via an Nmap script 'ftp-anon' outputting 'Anonymous FTP login allowed'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>FTP Service on Port 21</li><li>vsftpd 2.3.4</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for email, computer logins, or access to sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised, making the organization highly susceptible to phishing, brute-force attacks, and credential stuffing. This was identified through organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA requirements across these critical areas.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email Systems</li><li>Workstation Logins</li><li>Sensitive Data Systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks security awareness training for both new and existing employees. This leaves employees vulnerable to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) and increases the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents, such as clicking malicious links or mishandling sensitive information. This was identified through organizational data indicating 'No' for security awareness training for new employees and annual training.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All Employees</li><li>Organizational Security Posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Operating Systems (Windows 7) - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multiple workstations are running Windows 7, an operating system that has reached its end-of-life and no longer receives security updates from Microsoft. This exposes these systems to known and unpatched vulnerabilities, making them highly susceptible to malware, exploits, and unauthorized access. The impact includes potential data breaches, system compromise, and disruption of operations. This was identified as an existing vulnerability in the 'Current Risks' assessment.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations running Windows 7</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediate action is required to address the identified critical vulnerabilities. For the anonymous FTP access, it is strongly recommended to disable anonymous login, restrict access to authorized users only, and consider migrating to more secure protocols like SFTP or FTPS. All vsftpd instances should be updated to the latest stable version. To mitigate the risk of credential compromise, multi-factor authentication (MFA) must be implemented across all critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. A comprehensive security awareness training program should be established for all employees, including mandatory training for new hires and annual refreshers for existing staff, to educate them on common threats like phishing and social engineering. Finally, all workstations running Windows 7 must be upgraded to a currently supported operating system (e.g., Windows 10 or 11) to ensure they receive essential security updates and patches.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces a high level of cybersecurity risk due to critical misconfigurations, a lack of fundamental security controls, and an unpatched environment. The presence of anonymous FTP access, the absence of MFA across critical systems, insufficient security awareness training, and the use of end-of-life operating systems collectively create a highly exploitable attack surface. While an acceptable use policy is a positive step, it is insufficient to protect against the identified technical and human-centric vulnerabilities. Addressing these issues with urgency is paramount to improving the organization's overall security posture and readiness against cyber threats.</p>
