        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open SSH port (22) on at least one host, indicating a potential entry point that requires immediate attention. Furthermore, a review of organizational policies highlighted significant gaps in foundational security controls. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for email access or computer logins, leaving these critical access points vulnerable to credential compromise. While MFA is implemented for sensitive data systems, this partial adoption creates inconsistencies. The absence of an employee acceptable use policy (AUP) and regular security awareness training for all employees further weakens the organization's 'human firewall,' increasing susceptibility to social engineering and internal threats.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed via Open SSH Port - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A critical misconfiguration was identified where a service typically intended for local access (implied by 'Localhost Exposed') is accessible externally via an open SSH port (22). This vulnerability, rated with a CVSS score of 10.0, indicates that an attacker could gain complete control over the affected system with minimal effort, potentially leading to full system compromise, data exfiltration, or further network penetration. The open SSH port provides a direct attack vector, and the 'Localhost Exposed' nature suggests a severe architectural or configuration flaw. This was identified through network port scanning and vulnerability assessment.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP Address of Host with Port 22 Open</li><li>SSH Service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Implementation - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email or logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if employee credentials are compromised through phishing, malware, or data breaches. Without MFA, a stolen username and password are often sufficient for an attacker to gain full access to an employee's email account or workstation, potentially leading to further network penetration, data exfiltration, or business email compromise. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email System</li><li>Employee Workstations</li><li>Network Access Points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Security Awareness Training and Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy (AUP) and does not conduct regular security awareness training for new or existing employees. This creates a significant 'human firewall' vulnerability, as employees may unknowingly engage in risky behaviors (e.g., clicking malicious links, using weak passwords, mishandling sensitive data) due to a lack of understanding of cybersecurity best practices and organizational expectations. Without an AUP, there are no clear guidelines for appropriate technology use, and without training, employees are less equipped to identify and report threats. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All Employees</li><li>Organizational Data</li><li>Network Infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement robust security measures for the exposed SSH port, including disabling password authentication, enforcing key-based authentication, restricting access to trusted IP addresses, and regularly patching the SSH daemon. Furthermore, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be mandated for all email accounts and computer logins to significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access from compromised credentials. The organization should also develop and enforce a comprehensive acceptable use policy (AUP) and establish a mandatory, recurring security awareness training program for all employees, including new hires, to cultivate a strong security culture and empower employees to identify and report threats effectively. Regular network scans and vulnerability assessments should be conducted to proactively identify and address misconfigurations.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks stemming from critical vulnerabilities in both its technical infrastructure and human element. The presence of a critically exposed service via an open SSH port, coupled with the absence of MFA for key access points (email, computers) and a lack of essential security policies and training, creates a highly vulnerable environment. While MFA is appropriately applied to sensitive data systems, the broader security posture is weak, leaving the organization susceptible to unauthorized access, data breaches, and social engineering attacks. Immediate and comprehensive action is required to address these critical gaps and enhance the overall cybersecurity readiness.</p>
