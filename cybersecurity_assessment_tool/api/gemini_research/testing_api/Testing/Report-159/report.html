        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes a MySQL database (version 5.7.33) on port 3306. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required for computer logins, it is not enforced for email access or sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not provide security awareness training for new employees, although annual training is conducted for all staff.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network. This exposes the database to potential unauthorized access and exploitation, especially given the specific version (5.7.33) which may have known vulnerabilities. This was identified via network port scanning.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is recommended to immediately implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from necessary internal IP addresses or specific trusted hosts. For long-term security, consider placing the database behind a VPN or within a more isolated network segment. Additionally, implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and sensitive data systems to significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials. Develop and implement an employee acceptable use policy to clearly define expectations for technology usage and data handling. Lastly, introduce security awareness training for all new employees during their onboarding process to ensure they understand security best practices from day one.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization faces significant risks primarily due to an exposed MySQL database and gaps in its security policies and MFA implementation. While annual security training is in place, the lack of MFA for critical systems like email and sensitive data, absence of an acceptable use policy, and no initial security training for new hires create exploitable weaknesses. Addressing these vulnerabilities and policy gaps is crucial to enhance the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and readiness against potential threats.</p>
