        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open SSH port (22) on at least one host, indicating a potential entry point that requires robust security measures. A review of organizational data highlights significant gaps in foundational security practices. Specifically, there is a complete absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy, which can lead to inconsistent security practices and increased insider risk. While annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees, there is no specific training for new hires, leaving a critical vulnerability during the onboarding phase. These findings suggest a low level of readiness against common cyber threats, particularly those leveraging compromised credentials and human factors.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unsecured SSH Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH port (22) was identified on a host within the network. While SSH is essential for remote administration, an improperly secured SSH service can be a significant attack vector. Attackers could attempt brute-force attacks, exploit known vulnerabilities in older SSH versions, or gain unauthorized access if weak credentials are used, leading to remote code execution, data exfiltration, or further network penetration.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host(s) with open port 22</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email, logging into computers, or accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are compromised through phishing, malware, or brute-force attacks. A single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to critical systems and data, leading to data breaches, financial loss, and reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email systems</li><li>Employee computers</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without a clear AUP, employees may unknowingly or knowingly engage in activities that introduce security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling company data. This absence creates ambiguity regarding expected behavior and makes it difficult to enforce security best practices, increasing the likelihood of insider threats or accidental data exposure.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Incomplete Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees, although annual training is provided for all employees. New employees are often targeted by social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) as they may be less familiar with organizational security policies and common threats. The lack of initial training leaves a critical gap where new hires are vulnerable during their onboarding period, potentially exposing the organization to social engineering, malware, and other human-centric attacks.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Email systems</li><li>Network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. For the open SSH port, ensure it is secured by disabling root login, enforcing strong password policies or key-based authentication, implementing rate limiting, and regularly patching the SSH service. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy that clearly outlines expected behavior regarding company assets and data. Furthermore, establish a mandatory security awareness training program specifically for new employees during their onboarding process, in addition to the existing annual training for all staff. Regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing should also be conducted to identify and address further potential weaknesses.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several significant cybersecurity vulnerabilities, primarily stemming from a lack of fundamental security controls and policies. The absence of MFA across critical systems, coupled with an open SSH port and gaps in employee training and policy, indicates a low level of readiness against common and impactful cyber threats. Addressing these issues proactively is crucial to prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security incidents, thereby enhancing the overall security posture and resilience of the organization.</p>
