        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>A network scan identified an open HTTP port (80) on at least one host, which could expose web services to potential vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the organization's security posture indicates a lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins, significantly increasing the risk of unauthorized access. New employees are not provided with security awareness training, leaving them susceptible to social engineering and unaware of critical security protocols. While annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees and an acceptable use policy is in place, these gaps represent notable areas for improvement.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open HTTP Port - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An Nmap scan detected port 80 (HTTP) as open on a host within the network. An open HTTP port can expose web services to various attacks, including web application vulnerabilities, unpatched server software exploits, or information disclosure. If not properly secured, monitored, and patched, this could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or system compromise.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li><li>Host(s) with open port 80</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly weakens the authentication process, making systems highly vulnerable to credential theft, phishing attacks, and brute-force attempts. If an attacker obtains a user's password, they can gain unauthorized access to the computer and potentially the network without an additional layer of security.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers</li><li>User login processes</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training upon onboarding. This leaves them unprepared to identify and respond to common cybersecurity threats such as phishing, malware, and social engineering attacks. A lack of initial training increases the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents, data breaches, or compliance violations.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Email systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately review the necessity and security configuration of any open port 80, ensuring all web services are patched, hardened, and ideally protected with HTTPS. Implementing mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins is critical to significantly enhance authentication security and protect against credential-based attacks. Furthermore, a comprehensive security awareness training program must be integrated into the onboarding process for all new employees to ensure they are equipped with the knowledge to identify and avoid common cyber threats from day one. Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments should also be conducted to proactively identify and address emerging risks.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several significant cybersecurity risks, primarily stemming from an open HTTP port, the absence of MFA for computer logins, and a gap in security awareness training for new employees. While some foundational security practices are in place, these vulnerabilities present clear pathways for potential unauthorized access and data compromise. Addressing these critical areas will substantially improve the organization's overall security posture and readiness against evolving cyber threats.</p>
