        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes a MySQL database (version 5.7.33) on port 3306. While the organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems, it does not require MFA for computer logins. Positive security practices include an employee acceptable use policy and regular security awareness training for all employees, indicating a foundational commitment to security awareness.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network, potentially exposing the database to unauthorized access. The identified version is MySQL 5.7.33. An open database port without proper access controls can lead to data breaches, unauthorized data manipulation, or denial of service if exploited.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or other means. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's workstation and potentially the internal network, leading to lateral movement and data exfiltration.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Internal network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement strict firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted IP addresses or internal systems. For a more robust long-term solution, consider placing the database behind a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or implementing other secure access mechanisms that do not expose the port directly to the network. Furthermore, it is critical to immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins across the organization. This will significantly enhance endpoint security and prevent unauthorized access even if passwords are compromised, adding a crucial layer of defense against credential theft.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a mixed security posture. While commendable efforts are made in security awareness training and acceptable use policies, and MFA is utilized for email and sensitive data, critical vulnerabilities exist. The open MySQL port and the absence of MFA for computer logins represent significant risks that could lead to unauthorized data access or network compromise. Addressing these high-severity vulnerabilities promptly is essential to strengthen the overall security readiness and protect organizational assets.</p>
