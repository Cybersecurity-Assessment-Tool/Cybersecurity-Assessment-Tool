            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network exhibits a critical external exposure with an open Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) port (3389), making it vulnerable to direct attacks. Internally, the security posture is significantly weakened by several policy and training deficiencies. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is inconsistently applied, being absent for email and sensitive data systems, although it is required for computer logins. Furthermore, there is a complete lack of an employee acceptable use policy and no security awareness training provided for either new or existing employees, creating substantial human factor risks.",

                        "Risk": "RDP Exposure",
                        "Overview": "Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed externally on port 3389. This allows potential attackers to attempt brute-force attacks or exploit RDP vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to internal systems. This was identified via network port scanning.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Email and Sensitive Data",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email or sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing or credential stuffing attacks, as a single compromised password could grant full access to critical resources. This was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Email systems",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Absence of Security Policies and Training",
                        "Overview": "The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct security awareness training for new or existing employees. This creates a significant human factor vulnerability, as employees may unknowingly engage in risky behaviors, fall victim to social engineering, or mishandle sensitive information due to a lack of awareness and clear guidelines. This was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "Organizational policies and procedures"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "Immediately close port 3389 externally or restrict access to only trusted IP ranges. Implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) for secure remote access to internal resources, including RDP. Implement mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and sensitive data systems. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy. Establish a mandatory security awareness training program for all new hires and conduct annual refresher training for all employees. Regularly review and update security policies and procedures to align with current threat landscapes.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization faces critical external exposure through an open RDP port and significant internal vulnerabilities due to inconsistent MFA implementation, a complete lack of security policies, and no security awareness training. While MFA is used for computer logins, its absence for email and sensitive data, combined with the open RDP port, creates a high-risk environment. Addressing these fundamental gaps is crucial for improving the overall security posture and reducing the likelihood of a successful cyberattack."
