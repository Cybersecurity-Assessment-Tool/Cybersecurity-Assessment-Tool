        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open port 8080 hosting a service titled 'TOP SECRET DB', indicating a critical exposure of potentially sensitive data. Furthermore, the organization's self-reported data highlights significant gaps in its security posture. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not enforced for email access or sensitive data systems, leaving critical accounts and data vulnerable to credential-based attacks. The absence of an employee acceptable use policy and annual security awareness training for all employees further exacerbates the risk by increasing the likelihood of human-factor vulnerabilities and inconsistent security practices across the workforce. While MFA is required for computer logins, this single control is insufficient to protect against the identified critical and high-severity risks.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unsecured Database Access - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open port 8080 was identified, exposing a service titled 'TOP SECRET DB'. This indicates a critical security vulnerability where a sensitive database might be directly accessible from the network, potentially without proper authentication or encryption. Unauthorized access could lead to data breaches, data manipulation, or complete system compromise. This was identified via Nmap scan.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li><li>TOP SECRET DB service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access sensitive data systems. This leaves critical systems vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are stolen or guessed. A breach of these systems could result in severe data loss, regulatory non-compliance, financial penalties, and reputational damage. This was identified from the organization's self-reported data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>critical business applications</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Email Account Compromise Risk - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of email account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. Compromised email accounts can be used for further internal phishing, business email compromise (BEC) scams, or access to other connected services. This was identified from the organization's self-reported data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee email accounts</li><li>email server/service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Uncontrolled Employee Behavior - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines, employees may engage in activities that inadvertently introduce security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive information. This increases the overall attack surface and makes it harder to enforce security best practices. This was identified from the organization's self-reported data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee workstations</li><li>network resources</li><li>data handling processes</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Security Awareness - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. While new employees receive training, the lack of recurring training means employees may not be updated on the latest threats, best practices, or organizational policies. This can lead to a higher susceptibility to social engineering attacks, phishing, and other human-factor vulnerabilities. This was identified from the organization's self-reported data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified critical and high-severity risks, it is imperative to immediately address the exposed 'TOP SECRET DB' service by securing port 8080, implementing strong authentication, and ensuring proper network segmentation. Furthermore, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be enforced for all email accounts and sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access. The organization should develop and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to establish clear guidelines for secure behavior. Additionally, a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees should be established to ensure continuous education on current threats and best practices, thereby strengthening the human firewall.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces critical vulnerabilities, primarily due to an exposed 'TOP SECRET DB' service and a lack of MFA for sensitive systems and email. These technical weaknesses, combined with significant gaps in security policies and employee training, indicate a low level of cybersecurity readiness. Immediate action is required to secure critical assets and implement foundational security controls to prevent potential data breaches and system compromises.</p>
