        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational security posture with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) implemented for email and computer logins, alongside annual security awareness training for all employees. An acceptable use policy is also in place. However, critical gaps exist, specifically the lack of MFA for sensitive data systems and the absence of security awareness training for new employees. Network scanning revealed an active host with port 80 open, indicating an exposed web service that could be a potential entry point.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Sensitive data systems are not protected by Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches if user credentials are compromised through phishing, malware, or other means. Without MFA, a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to critical information. This vulnerability was identified through the organization's policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate New Employee Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training upon onboarding. This creates a period during which new hires may be unaware of organizational security policies, common threats like phishing and social engineering, and best practices for data handling. This oversight increases the 'human factor' risk, potentially leading to accidental data exposure or successful social engineering attacks. This vulnerability was identified through the organization's policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed Web Service (Port 80 Open) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An Nmap scan identified an open port 80 on an active host, indicating an unencrypted web service is running. This exposes the organization to various web-based attacks, including cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, or denial-of-service (DoS) if the service is not properly secured and regularly patched. Furthermore, any traffic over HTTP is unencrypted and susceptible to interception, potentially revealing sensitive information. This vulnerability was identified via network scan data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with IP 'up'</li><li>Port 80</li><li>Any web application running on port 80</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all sensitive data systems to enhance protection against credential compromise. Furthermore, a mandatory security awareness training program should be integrated into the onboarding process for all new employees to ensure they are equipped with essential security knowledge from day one. For the exposed web service on port 80, a thorough review is necessary to determine its purpose. If it hosts a web application, it should be secured, regularly patched, and ideally migrated to HTTPS (port 443) to encrypt all traffic. If the service is not essential, the port should be closed to reduce the attack surface.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization has established a baseline of security controls, including MFA for common access points and annual security training. However, significant vulnerabilities remain, particularly concerning the protection of sensitive data systems and the initial security education of new employees. The presence of an unencrypted, exposed web service also presents a tangible risk. Addressing these critical areas will substantially improve the organization's overall security posture and readiness against evolving cyber threats.</p>
