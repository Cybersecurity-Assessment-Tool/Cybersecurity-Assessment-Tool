        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to multi-factor authentication (MFA), with policies requiring MFA for email access, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. However, significant gaps exist in foundational security practices. The organization currently lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or provide annual training for all staff. Network scanning identified an open SSH port (22) on a host, which, while potentially legitimate, represents an attack surface if not properly secured. Additionally, a critical vulnerability related to 'Localhost Exposed' was identified, indicating a severe system misconfiguration or exposure.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A critical vulnerability was identified where localhost is exposed, potentially allowing unauthorized access or internal network enumeration. This exposure carries a CVSS score of 10.0, indicating the highest possible severity and a high likelihood of exploitation with severe impact.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Missing Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. This absence creates a significant risk as employees may not have clear guidelines regarding the appropriate use of company resources, leading to potential misuse, data breaches, or the introduction of malware through unsafe online practices.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not provide security awareness training for new employees, nor does it conduct annual training for all staff. This deficiency leaves employees vulnerable to social engineering attacks, phishing, and other human-factor threats, significantly increasing the risk of successful cyberattacks and data compromise.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Email systems</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Organizational data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH (port 22) was detected on a host within the network. While SSH is a legitimate service for remote administration, an open port presents a potential attack surface if not properly secured with strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., key-based authentication), up-to-date software, and restricted access via firewall rules. Without proper hardening, this could lead to unauthorized access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with open port 22</li><li>Network perimeter</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediate action is required to address the 'Localhost Exposed' critical vulnerability by investigating its root cause and implementing appropriate remediation to secure the system. A comprehensive employee acceptable use policy must be developed, communicated, and enforced across the organization to establish clear guidelines for resource usage. Furthermore, a mandatory security awareness training program should be implemented for all new hires and conducted annually for all employees to educate them on current cyber threats and best practices. For the open SSH port, it is recommended to review its necessity, ensure it is configured with strong, key-based authentication, disable password authentication, apply least privilege access controls, and keep the SSH server software updated to mitigate potential exploitation. The organization should continue to leverage and enforce its existing MFA policies for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has a commendable stance on multi-factor authentication, its overall cybersecurity readiness is significantly hampered by critical vulnerabilities related to system exposure, a lack of fundamental security policies, and insufficient security awareness training. These gaps expose the organization to substantial human-factor risks and potential direct system compromises. Addressing these deficiencies is paramount to improving the organization's security posture and reducing its susceptibility to cyber threats.</p>
