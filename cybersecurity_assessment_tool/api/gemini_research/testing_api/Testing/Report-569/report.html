        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes an RDP service (port 3389) to the internet, which is a critical vulnerability. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for computer logins and sensitive data systems, it is notably absent for email access, posing a significant risk. Furthermore, the organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees, despite training new hires. These policy and training gaps, combined with the exposed RDP service, indicate a moderate to high overall risk posture.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>RDP Exposure - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is accessible from the internet via port 3389. This direct exposure allows potential attackers to attempt brute-force attacks or exploit RDP vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to internal systems. The impact could range from data theft to full system compromise. This was identified through a network scan showing port 3389 (ms-wbt-server) as open.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li><li>Port 3389</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of email account compromise through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks. A compromised email account can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, or further lateral movement within the network. This was identified through a review of organizational security policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee email accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines, employees may engage in activities that inadvertently introduce security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive data. This can lead to malware infections, data breaches, or compliance violations. This was identified through a review of organizational policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Organizational IT resources</li><li>Employee behavior</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Infrequent Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual training for all employees. This leads to a degradation of security knowledge over time, making employees more susceptible to evolving threats like advanced phishing campaigns, social engineering, and malware. The impact includes an increased likelihood of successful cyberattacks. This was identified through a review of organizational training programs.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee security posture</li><li>Organizational resilience to social engineering</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately close port 3389 to external access and implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) for secure remote RDP access. Furthermore, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be enforced for all email accounts to prevent unauthorized access. The organization should develop and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy, ensuring all employees are aware of and adhere to its guidelines. Finally, a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees should be established to ensure continuous education on current threats and best practices, thereby strengthening the human firewall.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces critical and high-severity vulnerabilities primarily due to an exposed RDP service and significant gaps in its security policies and training. While some MFA is in place, the lack of MFA for email, absence of an acceptable use policy, and infrequent security awareness training leave the organization susceptible to common and advanced cyber threats. Addressing these issues promptly is crucial for improving the overall cybersecurity posture and readiness.</p>
