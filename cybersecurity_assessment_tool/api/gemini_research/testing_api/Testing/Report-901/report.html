        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan identified an Nginx web server (version 1.18.0) running on port 443 (HTTPS). While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for email access, it is notably absent for computer logins and sensitive data systems. The organization conducts security awareness training for both new and existing employees annually, which is a positive security practice. However, there is no established employee acceptable use policy.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for employee computer logins. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or other means. Without a second factor, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's workstation and potentially the internal network. This vulnerability was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Internal network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access sensitive data systems within the organization. This poses a critical risk, as unauthorized access to these systems could lead to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, financial loss, and reputational damage. A compromised single factor (e.g., password) could allow an attacker direct access to confidential information. This vulnerability was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases containing confidential information</li><li>Cloud storage for sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Nginx Web Server - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nginx web server identified on port 443 is running version 1.18.0. This version is outdated and likely contains known security vulnerabilities that have been patched in newer releases. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to various attacks, including denial-of-service, information disclosure, or remote code execution, compromising the web server and potentially other connected systems. This was identified via network scanning.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Nginx web server (version 1.18.0)</li><li>Port 443 (HTTPS)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy (AUP). Without a formal AUP, employees may be unaware of their responsibilities regarding the use of company IT resources, data handling, and internet usage. This can lead to risky behaviors, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive data, increasing the overall attack surface and potential for security incidents. This vulnerability was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational IT resources</li><li>Data handling procedures</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and access to sensitive data systems immediately. This will provide a crucial layer of defense against credential theft. Furthermore, the Nginx web server should be updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities and ensure optimal security. Finally, a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy must be developed, communicated, and enforced to establish clear guidelines for IT resource usage and data handling, thereby reducing human-factor risks.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security through regular security awareness training. However, critical vulnerabilities exist due to the absence of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, the use of outdated software, and the lack of an employee acceptable use policy. Addressing these high and medium severity risks is paramount to prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and maintain a robust security posture against evolving cyber threats. Immediate action on the outlined recommendations is essential to improve overall readiness.</p>
