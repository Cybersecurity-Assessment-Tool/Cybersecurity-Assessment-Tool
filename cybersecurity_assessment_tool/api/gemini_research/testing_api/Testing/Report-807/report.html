        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to identity and access management by requiring Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. However, a critical vulnerability was identified with an open MySQL port (3306) running version 5.7.33, exposing the database service to potential external threats. Furthermore, significant gaps exist in the organization's security culture and policies, specifically the absence of an employee acceptable use policy and a complete lack of security awareness training for both new and existing employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network, exposing the database service (MySQL 5.7.33) to potential unauthorized access or attacks. This vulnerability was identified through a network scan that revealed the open port and service version. Without proper network segmentation, firewall rules, and strong access controls, this open port presents a significant attack surface for data breaches or service compromise.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not have an employee acceptable use policy. This absence means there are no formal guidelines for employees regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, internet access, and data handling. This increases the risk of misuse of company assets, introduction of malware, data leakage, and other security incidents due to a lack of clear behavioral expectations and accountability.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational policies</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training. This leaves them unprepared to identify and respond to common cybersecurity threats such as phishing, social engineering, and malware. Without foundational training, new hires are more susceptible to becoming vectors for attacks, potentially compromising organizational systems and data shortly after joining.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. Regular training is crucial for keeping the workforce informed about evolving cyber threats, reinforcing security best practices, and maintaining a strong 'human firewall'. The lack of ongoing training leads to a degradation of security knowledge over time, increasing the overall susceptibility of the organization to various types of cyberattacks.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted internal IP addresses or via a secure VPN for remote access. Furthermore, ensure that the MySQL database is configured with strong, unique credentials and that all sensitive data is encrypted. On the policy and training front, the organization must develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to set clear expectations for IT resource usage. Crucially, mandatory security awareness training should be established for all new employees upon onboarding, and annual refresher training must be implemented for all staff to ensure continuous education on current threats, phishing detection, password hygiene, and data handling best practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has a commendable foundation in identity and access management through its widespread use of MFA, critical vulnerabilities exist in its network perimeter and human element. The exposed MySQL database poses an immediate and high risk, while the absence of an acceptable use policy and comprehensive security awareness training for all employees significantly weakens the overall security posture. Addressing these gaps through technical controls and robust policy and training initiatives is paramount to enhancing the organization's resilience against cyber threats and achieving a more mature security readiness.</p>
