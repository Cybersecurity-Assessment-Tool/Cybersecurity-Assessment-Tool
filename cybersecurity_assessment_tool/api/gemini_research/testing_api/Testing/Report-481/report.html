        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Based on the network scan, the organization has an Nginx web server (version 1.18.0) running on port 443, indicating a web presence. Further assessment of organizational policies reveals several critical gaps in security posture related to access controls and employee awareness.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. Compromised email accounts can lead to further internal system breaches, data exfiltration, and business email compromise (BEC) scams.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access sensitive data systems. This exposes critical data to a higher risk of unauthorized access if primary credentials are compromised. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to sensitive information, leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This absence means there are no clear guidelines for employees regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, data handling, internet usage, and security best practices. This can lead to increased insider threats, misuse of company assets, and a higher likelihood of security incidents due to unmanaged employee behavior.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>IT resources</li><li>Data handling processes</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training. This leaves new hires vulnerable to common social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) and unaware of organizational security policies and procedures from the outset. This significantly increases the risk of new employees inadvertently introducing vulnerabilities or falling victim to attacks, potentially compromising the organization's security posture.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and access to sensitive data systems. This will add a crucial layer of security, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access. Furthermore, the organization should develop and implement a comprehensive Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) that clearly outlines employee responsibilities regarding IT resource usage and data protection. Finally, a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees should be established as part of their onboarding process to ensure they are security-conscious from day one. Additionally, ensure the Nginx server and all other software components are regularly updated and patched.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant security risks primarily due to the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for email and sensitive data systems, the absence of an acceptable use policy, and the omission of security awareness training for new employees. While annual security training is conducted, these foundational gaps leave the organization vulnerable to various cyber threats, including unauthorized access, data breaches, and social engineering attacks. Addressing these vulnerabilities is crucial for enhancing the overall security posture and readiness.</p>
