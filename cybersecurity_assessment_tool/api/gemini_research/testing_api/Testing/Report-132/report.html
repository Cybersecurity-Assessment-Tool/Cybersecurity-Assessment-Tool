        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, and by having an acceptable use policy and security awareness training for new employees. However, critical gaps exist in the protection of sensitive data systems and the ongoing education of its workforce. Specifically, the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems and the lack of annual security awareness training for all employees represent significant vulnerabilities that could be exploited.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information should credentials be compromised through phishing, malware, or other means. Without MFA, a single compromised password can lead to a data breach, potentially resulting in severe financial, reputational, and regulatory consequences. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational security posture questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Recurring Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This leaves the workforce vulnerable to evolving social engineering tactics, phishing campaigns, and other modern threats. Regular, updated training is crucial to reinforce best practices, keep employees informed about new risks, and reduce the human element as a potential attack vector. This oversight was identified through the organizational security posture questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data susceptible to social engineering</li><li>Email systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all systems containing sensitive data. This will add a crucial layer of security, significantly reducing the impact of compromised credentials. Furthermore, a mandatory annual security awareness training program should be established for all employees. This training should cover current threat landscapes, social engineering techniques, and best practices for data handling, ensuring that the entire workforce remains vigilant and informed against evolving cyber threats.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently exhibits a mixed security posture. While strong in some areas such as initial MFA deployment and new employee training, it possesses critical vulnerabilities related to the protection of sensitive data and ongoing employee education. Addressing the lack of MFA for sensitive data systems and implementing comprehensive annual security awareness training are paramount steps to enhance the overall security readiness and resilience against potential cyberattacks.</p>
