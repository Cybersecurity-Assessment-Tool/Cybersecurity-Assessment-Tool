        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to cybersecurity through its acceptable use policy and regular security awareness training for all employees. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required for email access, which is a positive step. However, critical gaps exist in authentication protocols for computer logins and sensitive data systems, where MFA is not currently enforced. Due to broken network scan data and vulnerability reports, a comprehensive technical assessment of network infrastructure, open ports, and software vulnerabilities could not be performed. The current assessment is primarily based on organizational security policies and practices.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Weak Authentication for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication. An attacker gaining access to a single set of credentials could potentially compromise an employee's workstation and gain further access to the internal network.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers</li><li>Network endpoints</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Weak Authentication for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk, as compromised credentials could grant direct access to confidential information, leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and significant reputational damage. The absence of MFA on these systems makes them a prime target for attackers seeking high-value data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases containing sensitive information</li><li>File shares with confidential data</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>It is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins across the organization to significantly enhance endpoint security and mitigate the risk of credential theft. Furthermore, MFA must be immediately enforced for all access to sensitive data systems to protect critical information assets from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Regular audits of MFA implementation and user compliance should be conducted. While security awareness training and an acceptable use policy are in place, these should be continuously updated to reflect evolving threat landscapes and reinforce the importance of strong authentication practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization has a good foundation with its security awareness training and acceptable use policy, and the implementation of MFA for email access is a positive step. However, the absence of MFA for computer logins and, more critically, for sensitive data systems represents significant vulnerabilities that could lead to unauthorized access and data breaches. Addressing these authentication gaps is paramount to improving the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and readiness against modern threats.</p>
