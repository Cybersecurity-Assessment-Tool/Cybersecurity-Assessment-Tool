                "Summary": "The organization operates a network with an Nginx web server (version 1.18.0) exposed on port 443, indicating an HTTPS service. While multi-factor authentication (MFA) is implemented for email and sensitive data systems, a critical gap exists as MFA is not required for computer logins. Furthermore, the organization lacks comprehensive security awareness training, neither for new employees nor on an annual basis for all staff, despite having an acceptable use policy in place. This suggests a mixed security posture with strong controls in some areas but significant weaknesses in others.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Logins",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require MFA for employees to log into their computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to internal systems if credentials are stolen or compromised through phishing, keyloggers, or brute-force attacks. A single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to an employee's workstation and potentially pivot to other network resources. This was identified from the organizational data indicating \"Do you require MFA to log into computers?\":\"No\".",

                            "All employee workstations",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Absence of Security Awareness Training for New Employees",
                        "Overview": "New employees are not provided with security awareness training. This leaves them vulnerable to common social engineering tactics, phishing attempts, and other cyber threats from the outset of their employment. Without proper training, new hires may inadvertently introduce risks to the organization by falling for scams, mishandling sensitive information, or failing to follow security protocols. This was identified from the organizational data indicating \"Does your organization do security awareness training for new employees?\":\"No\".",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                    {
                        "Risk": "Absence of Annual Security Awareness Training for All Employees",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. Regular training is crucial to keep employees informed about evolving cyber threats, reinforce best practices, and maintain a strong security culture. Without it, employees may forget previous training, become complacent, or be unaware of new attack vectors, increasing the overall human risk factor for the organization. This was identified from the organizational data indicating \"Does your organization do security awareness training for all employees at least once per year?\":\"No\".",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "Organizational data",
                            "Network security"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all computer logins. This critical step will provide an additional layer of security against unauthorized access, even if passwords are compromised. Furthermore, a comprehensive security awareness training program should be established. This program must include mandatory training for all new employees upon onboarding and annual refresher training for all existing staff to ensure continuous education on current cyber threats and best security practices. Additionally, while the Nginx server is running HTTPS, regular vulnerability scanning and patch management for the web server and its underlying operating system should be conducted to address any potential software vulnerabilities.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing MFA for email and sensitive data systems and having an acceptable use policy. However, significant vulnerabilities exist due to the lack of MFA for computer logins and the complete absence of a structured security awareness training program for both new and existing employees. These gaps represent considerable risks that could lead to unauthorized system access and successful social engineering attacks. Addressing these critical areas is paramount to improving the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and reducing its susceptibility to common cyber threats."
