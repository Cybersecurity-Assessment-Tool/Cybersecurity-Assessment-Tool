        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open port 8080 hosting a service titled 'TOP SECRET DB', indicating a critical exposure of potentially sensitive data. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required for computer logins and sensitive data systems, it is notably absent for email access. The organization has an acceptable use policy and conducts annual security awareness training for all employees, but lacks specific security awareness training for new employees, leaving a gap in initial onboarding security.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unsecured Sensitive Database Exposure - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open port 8080 was identified, hosting a service titled 'TOP SECRET DB'. This indicates a potential exposure of highly sensitive data to the network, possibly without adequate authentication or encryption. The presence of such a title strongly suggests critical information is accessible, posing a severe risk of data breach, unauthorized access, and compromise of confidential information. This was identified via an Nmap scan with the http-title script.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li><li>TOP SECRET DB service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Email Account Compromise via Single Factor Authentication - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. Email accounts are frequently targeted by phishing attacks and credential stuffing. Without MFA, a compromised password (e.g., through a data breach or phishing) grants an attacker full access to an employee's email, which can then be used for further internal phishing, business email compromise (BEC) scams, or access to other systems via password reset mechanisms. This was identified from the organization's security policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee email accounts</li><li>Email server/service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Increased Human Factor Vulnerability for New Hires - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often unfamiliar with an organization's specific security policies, common threats, and reporting procedures. This makes them particularly susceptible to social engineering attacks, phishing, and accidental security policy violations, increasing the overall human factor risk for the organization during their initial employment period. While annual training is conducted, the initial onboarding period is critical. This was identified from the organization's security awareness training policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediately investigate and secure the service running on port 8080, especially given its 'TOP SECRET DB' title. Implement strong authentication, access controls, and encryption, or remove the service if it's not intended to be exposed. Furthermore, enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts to significantly reduce the risk of email compromise. Finally, develop and implement a mandatory security awareness training program specifically for new employees during their onboarding process to ensure they are equipped with essential security knowledge from day one.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization faces critical risks due to an exposed 'TOP SECRET DB' service and high risks from the lack of MFA for email. While some security measures are in place (MFA for computers/sensitive data, AUP, annual training), the absence of new employee security training creates a vulnerability in the human element. Addressing these identified vulnerabilities is crucial for enhancing the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and readiness against potential threats.</p>
