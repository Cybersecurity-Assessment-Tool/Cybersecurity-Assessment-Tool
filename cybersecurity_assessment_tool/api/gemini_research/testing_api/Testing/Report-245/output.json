            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, indicating a strong baseline for access control. An acceptable use policy is also in place. However, a network scan revealed an open Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) port (3389) exposed to the internet, which represents a critical vulnerability. Additionally, while annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees, new employees do not receive initial security awareness training, creating a potential gap in their understanding of security protocols from the outset.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "RDP Exposure",
                        "Overview": "Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed directly to the internet via an open port (3389). This allows potential attackers to attempt brute-force attacks or exploit RDP vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to internal systems. The impact could range from unauthorized access to sensitive data, system compromise, or ransomware deployment. This vulnerability was identified through a network scan showing port 3389 as open and accessible.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "IP address with open port 3389",
                            "Internal network systems accessible via RDP"
                        ]

                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of New Employee Security Training",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. This means new hires may not be immediately aware of the organization's specific security policies, best practices, and common threats (e.g., phishing, social engineering) from day one. This oversight increases the risk of human error leading to security incidents, as new employees might inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities or fall victim to attacks due to a lack of initial awareness. This was identified through the organizational data provided.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All new employees",
                            "Organizational security posture"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately close port 3389 to the internet. For legitimate remote access needs, implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution to ensure secure, encrypted access, requiring users to connect to the VPN before accessing RDP. Furthermore, establish a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees to ensure they are educated on security best practices and organizational policies from the start. Regularly reinforce security awareness through annual training for all staff, as currently practiced, and consider more frequent, targeted micro-trainings on emerging threats. Review and update the acceptable use policy to reflect current threats and technologies.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization demonstrates a commendable commitment to access control through widespread MFA implementation and an existing acceptable use policy. However, the presence of an internet-exposed RDP port represents a critical technical vulnerability that significantly compromises the network's perimeter security. Coupled with the absence of initial security awareness training for new employees, there are notable gaps in both technical and human security defenses. Addressing these issues, particularly the RDP exposure, is paramount to enhancing the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and reducing its attack surface."
