        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, and maintaining an acceptable use policy. Annual security awareness training is also conducted for all employees. However, critical gaps exist in the security posture, including the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems, a lack of initial security awareness training for new employees, and the use of an outdated Nginx web server (version 1.18.0) exposed on port 443. These areas represent significant vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Access Control for Sensitive Data - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if primary credentials are compromised (e.g., via phishing, brute-force, or credential stuffing attacks). Without MFA, a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to sensitive data, leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and reputational damage. This was identified directly from the organization's self-reported security posture.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Human Factor Vulnerability for New Hires - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees upon onboarding. While annual training is provided for all employees, new hires are particularly susceptible to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) and may not be immediately aware of organizational security policies and best practices. This gap in initial training can expose the organization to risks during a critical period when employees are learning new systems and processes, potentially leading to accidental data exposure, malware infections, or policy violations. This was identified from the organization's self-reported security posture.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Vulnerable Web Server Software - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nginx web server running on port 443 is identified as version 1.18.0. This version is significantly outdated and is no longer actively supported or receiving security updates. Older software versions often contain known vulnerabilities that have been patched in newer releases. An attacker could exploit these unpatched vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access, perform denial-of-service attacks, or execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially compromising the entire web application and underlying infrastructure. This was identified via network scanning, specifically the service banner for port 443.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Nginx web server (version 1.18.0)</li><li>Port 443</li><li>Web application hosted on Nginx</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to provide an essential layer of security against credential compromise. Furthermore, a comprehensive security awareness training program should be established for all new employees as part of their onboarding process to ensure they are equipped with foundational security knowledge from day one. Finally, the Nginx web server (version 1.18.0) should be updated to the latest stable and supported version to patch known vulnerabilities and ensure ongoing security updates. Regular patching and vulnerability management processes should be established for all internet-facing services.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has implemented some key security controls such as MFA for email and computer logins, and annual security training, significant vulnerabilities remain. The lack of MFA for sensitive data systems, the absence of initial security training for new hires, and the use of outdated web server software collectively present a high risk to the organization's data integrity and overall security posture. Addressing these critical areas is paramount to enhancing the organization's readiness against cyber threats and protecting its valuable assets.</p>
