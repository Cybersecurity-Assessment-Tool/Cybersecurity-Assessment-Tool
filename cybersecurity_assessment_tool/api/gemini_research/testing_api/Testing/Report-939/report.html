        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently has an open MySQL port (3306) running version 5.7.33. This exposes the database to potential external threats. Furthermore, the organization lacks multi-factor authentication (MFA) for critical access points including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. While an acceptable use policy is in place, there is no security awareness training for new employees or annual training for all employees, indicating a significant gap in human-centric security measures.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network. This allows external entities to potentially connect to and interact with the database, leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, or data manipulation. It was identified through network scanning revealing an open MySQL service.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for accessing email, logging into computers, or accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or other means. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to critical systems and data. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email access</li><li>Computer logins</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or annual training for all employees. This leaves employees vulnerable to social engineering attacks, phishing, and other human-centric threats, as they may not be equipped to identify and report suspicious activities. A lack of training can lead to accidental data breaches, malware infections, and policy violations. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement robust firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted internal IP addresses or via a secure VPN. For long-term security, consider placing the database behind a VPN or within a more isolated network segment. Crucially, multi-factor authentication (MFA) must be implemented across all critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, to significantly enhance protection against credential compromise. Furthermore, a comprehensive security awareness training program should be established, including mandatory training for all new employees and annual refreshers for all staff, to educate them on common threats like phishing and social engineering. Regularly review and update security policies and conduct periodic vulnerability assessments.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to an exposed database service, a complete lack of multi-factor authentication across critical systems, and insufficient security awareness training for its employees. While an acceptable use policy is in place, these fundamental security gaps leave the organization highly vulnerable to data breaches, unauthorized access, and successful social engineering attacks. Addressing these vulnerabilities with urgency is paramount to improving the overall security posture and readiness against modern cyber threats.</p>
