        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes a MySQL database running version 5.7.33 on port 3306. While MFA is utilized for sensitive data systems, there are significant gaps in identity and access management, as MFA is not required for email access or computer logins. Furthermore, security awareness training is not provided for new employees, although annual training is conducted for all existing employees. An acceptable use policy is in place.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The MySQL database server, version 5.7.33, is accessible via port 3306 directly from the network. This exposure increases the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and potential exploitation of known vulnerabilities in the MySQL version. The presence of an open database port was identified through network scanning.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted IP addresses or internal networks. For a long-term solution, consider placing the database behind a VPN or within a more isolated network segment. Additionally, implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and computer logins to significantly enhance identity and access management security. Establish a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees to ensure they are equipped with essential cybersecurity knowledge from day one.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization faces a critical security risk due to an exposed MySQL database, which could lead to unauthorized data access. Furthermore, the absence of MFA for email and computer logins, coupled with a lack of security awareness training for new employees, represents significant vulnerabilities in the organization's overall security posture. While the use of MFA for sensitive data systems and annual security training for existing employees are positive steps, addressing the immediate database exposure and strengthening foundational security practices like MFA and new employee training are paramount to improving the organization's readiness against cyber threats.</p>
