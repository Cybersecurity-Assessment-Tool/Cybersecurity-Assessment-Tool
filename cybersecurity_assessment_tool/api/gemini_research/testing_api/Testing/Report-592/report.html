        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The network scan indicated a highly locked-down perimeter with no open ports detected, suggesting a potentially robust external security posture or limited scan access. However, an assessment of organizational data reveals significant internal security policy and control weaknesses that could expose the organization to substantial risk despite a seemingly secure external network.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for employees to log into their computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised through phishing, keyloggers, or brute-force attacks. Without a second factor, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's workstation and potentially the internal network, leading to data exfiltration or further lateral movement.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Internal network access points</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA to access sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk, as unauthorized access to these systems could lead to severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA), significant financial loss, and severe reputational damage. A compromised single factor (password) is sufficient to gain access to highly valuable and protected information, making these systems prime targets for attackers.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases containing confidential information</li><li>Cloud storage with sensitive data</li><li>Critical business applications</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. Without an AUP, there are no clear guidelines or rules for how employees should use company IT resources, including computers, networks, and internet access. This absence can lead to employees inadvertently engaging in risky behaviors such as visiting malicious websites, installing unauthorized software, or sharing sensitive information inappropriately due to a lack of clear understanding of expectations, increasing the likelihood of security incidents and potential legal liabilities.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee-used IT resources</li><li>Organizational data integrity</li><li>Network security</li><li>Employee conduct</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and, critically, for access to all sensitive data systems. This will significantly enhance protection against credential theft. Furthermore, the organization must develop, disseminate, and enforce a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) to establish clear guidelines for IT resource usage, thereby reducing human-factor risks. Regular security awareness training should reinforce these policies and best practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the external network appears to be well-protected based on the scan data, the organization's internal security posture is significantly weakened by the absence of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, and the lack of an acceptable use policy. These vulnerabilities create substantial pathways for unauthorized access and data breaches, despite existing MFA for email and security awareness training. Addressing these critical gaps is paramount to improving overall cybersecurity readiness and protecting organizational assets.</p>
