        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The provided network scan data indicates no active hosts or open ports, which suggests either a highly isolated environment or, more likely, an incomplete or restricted scan. Therefore, a comprehensive assessment of network-level vulnerabilities cannot be performed based on the current scan results. Organizational data, however, reveals several critical gaps in security posture related to access control and employee training.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to internal systems if credentials are compromised through phishing, keylogging, or other means. Without a second factor, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access, leading to potential data breaches, system compromise, and lateral movement within the network. This was identified by the organizational policy stating 'Do you require MFA to log into computers?':'No'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers/workstations</li><li>Identity and Access Management (IAM) systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires, without proper foundational training, are more susceptible to social engineering attacks such as phishing, pretexting, and malware distribution. This oversight increases the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents, data exposure, or network compromise. This was identified by the organizational policy stating 'Does your organization do security awareness training for new employees?':'No'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>Organizational data and systems</li><li>Network perimeter defenses</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Annual Security Awareness Training for All Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not provide annual security awareness training for all employees. Without regular refreshers, employees' knowledge of evolving cyber threats, best practices, and organizational security policies can degrade over time. This creates a persistent vulnerability where employees may unknowingly engage in risky behaviors or fall victim to sophisticated social engineering tactics, thereby increasing the overall attack surface. This was identified by the organizational policy stating 'Does your organization do security awareness training for all employees at least once per year?':'No'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All existing employees</li><li>Organizational data and systems</li><li>Overall security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins. This critical step will provide an essential layer of defense against credential compromise. Furthermore, a comprehensive security awareness training program must be established. This program should include mandatory training for all new employees upon onboarding to instill foundational security knowledge, and annual refresher training for all existing employees to keep them informed about evolving threats and best practices. Additionally, a more thorough and unrestricted network scan should be conducted to accurately identify and assess any network-level vulnerabilities that could not be determined from the initial limited scan data.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to a lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for computer logins and inadequate security awareness training for both new and existing employees. While the provided network scan data was inconclusive regarding network-level vulnerabilities, these identified policy and training gaps represent a substantial and immediate threat to the organization's overall security readiness. Addressing these fundamental areas is paramount to mitigating the risk of unauthorized access, social engineering attacks, and maintaining a robust defense against cyber threats.</p>
