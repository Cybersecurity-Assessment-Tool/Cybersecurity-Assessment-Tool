        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently presents several significant security vulnerabilities. A network scan identified an active FTP service (vsftpd 2.3.4) on port 21, configured to allow anonymous login, which is a critical security flaw. Furthermore, an internal assessment revealed that workstations are running an outdated Windows 7 operating system, which is past its end-of-life and no longer receives security updates. Organizational policies are also weak in key areas: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for email access or sensitive data systems, and there is no formal employee acceptable use policy. While MFA is used for computer logins and annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees, the absence of training for new employees creates an initial vulnerability window. These combined factors indicate a high-risk environment susceptible to various cyber threats, including data breaches, unauthorized access, and malware infections.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Anonymous FTP Login Allowed & Outdated FTP Service - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The FTP service (vsftpd 2.3.4) running on port 21 is configured to allow anonymous login. This configuration can lead to unauthorized access to files, data leakage, or even server compromise if write permissions are misconfigured. Additionally, vsftpd version 2.3.4 is significantly outdated and known to have multiple critical vulnerabilities (e.g., CVE-2011-2523, CVE-2011-0762) that could be exploited by attackers.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>FTP server (vsftpd 2.3.4)</li><li>Port 21</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Windows Operating System - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Several computers within the organization are running Windows 7. This operating system has reached its end-of-life and no longer receives security updates from Microsoft. This makes these workstations highly vulnerable to known exploits, malware, and zero-day attacks, posing a significant risk to the entire network.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations running Windows 7</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data highly vulnerable to unauthorized access if a user's password is compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or other means. A breach of these systems could lead to severe data loss, compliance violations, and significant reputational and financial damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of email account compromise. If an employee's email password is stolen, an attacker could gain access to sensitive communications, launch phishing campaigns from a trusted source, or pivot to other systems within the organization.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines, employees may unknowingly engage in activities that compromise security, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive data. This increases the risk of internal threats, data leakage, and non-compliance.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>IT resources</li><li>Organizational data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training upon joining the organization. This leaves them susceptible to common cyber threats like phishing, social engineering, and malware from the start of their employment, potentially introducing vulnerabilities into the organization's environment before they understand best security practices.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, immediate action is required across several fronts. Firstly, the anonymous FTP access must be disabled, and the vsftpd service should either be updated to a current, supported version or removed if not essential. All workstations running Windows 7 must be upgraded to a currently supported operating system, such as Windows 10 or 11, to ensure they receive critical security updates. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) should be immediately implemented and enforced for all email accounts and, critically, for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access even if passwords are compromised. The organization must develop and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to guide appropriate behavior regarding IT resources and data handling. Furthermore, mandatory security awareness training should be introduced for all new employees as part of their onboarding process, complementing the existing annual training for all staff. Regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing should also be conducted to proactively identify and address new risks.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The current cybersecurity assessment reveals that the organization faces a high level of risk due to a combination of critical technical vulnerabilities and significant policy gaps. The presence of an outdated, anonymously accessible FTP server and end-of-life Windows 7 workstations creates immediate and severe exposure to exploitation. The lack of MFA for email and sensitive data systems, coupled with the absence of an acceptable use policy and initial security training for new hires, further exacerbates these risks. While the organization has some foundational security measures like MFA for computer logins and annual training, these are insufficient to counteract the identified critical weaknesses. Urgent and comprehensive remediation efforts are essential to protect organizational assets, maintain data integrity, and ensure business continuity against an evolving threat landscape.</p>
