        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open port 8080, exposing a service identified as 'TOP SECRET DB', indicating a critical vulnerability with potential direct access to sensitive information. Furthermore, the organization exhibits significant gaps in its security posture regarding foundational controls. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for email access, computer logins, or sensitive data systems, leaving these critical access points highly susceptible to credential-based attacks. The absence of an employee acceptable use policy creates ambiguity regarding appropriate IT resource usage, increasing various operational and security risks. While new employees receive security awareness training, the lack of annual training for all employees means the workforce may not be adequately prepared for evolving cyber threats, leaving the organization vulnerable to social engineering and phishing attacks.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open Port with Sensitive Data Exposure - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open port 8080 was identified during the network scan, exposing a service titled 'TOP SECRET DB'. This indicates a critical vulnerability where a potentially sensitive database or system is directly accessible from the network. Such exposure could lead to unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or system compromise, especially given the explicit 'TOP SECRET DB' title suggesting the presence of highly confidential information. This was identified via an Nmap scan with the http-title script.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li><li>TOP SECRET DB service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Authentication Controls (Lack of MFA) - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email, logging into computers, or accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly elevates the risk of unauthorized access. If an attacker compromises a single set of credentials through phishing, malware, or other means, they could gain full access to critical organizational resources without an additional layer of security. This widespread lack of MFA across key access points presents a substantial security weakness.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email access</li><li>Computer login</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines on the appropriate use of company IT resources, including networks, devices, and data, employees may inadvertently or intentionally engage in activities that pose security risks. This can lead to increased exposure to malware, data leakage, legal liabilities, and general misuse of company assets due to a lack of defined boundaries and expectations for employee conduct.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Data handling practices</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This creates a gap in the ongoing education necessary to combat evolving cyber threats. Employees who do not receive regular updates may become complacent, forget best practices, or remain unaware of new phishing techniques, social engineering tactics, and emerging malware, making them potential targets and weak points in the organization's defenses.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational susceptibility to social engineering and phishing</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is imperative to immediately secure or remove the 'TOP SECRET DB' service exposed on port 8080, implementing strict access controls and network segmentation. A comprehensive MFA implementation plan should be prioritized for all critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, to significantly enhance authentication security. Develop and enforce a clear employee acceptable use policy to establish guidelines for IT resource usage and minimize misuse. Furthermore, establish a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees to ensure continuous education on current cyber threats and best practices, reinforcing a strong security culture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces critical and high-severity vulnerabilities, primarily due to an exposed sensitive database and a widespread lack of Multi-Factor Authentication across key access points. These technical weaknesses are compounded by significant deficiencies in foundational security policies and training, specifically the absence of an acceptable use policy and inadequate ongoing security awareness training for the entire workforce. Without immediate and comprehensive remediation efforts, the organization remains highly susceptible to unauthorized access, data breaches, and operational disruptions, indicating a low state of cybersecurity readiness.</p>
