        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Based on the network scan data, the organization's external network perimeter appears to be well-secured, with no open ports detected. This indicates a strong initial defense against external network-based attacks. However, an assessment of the organization's internal security policies and practices reveals several areas of concern, particularly regarding user authentication for email and ongoing security education for all employees. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for computer logins and sensitive data systems, a critical gap exists in email access security. Furthermore, the absence of annual security awareness training for all employees presents a significant human-factor vulnerability that could be exploited through social engineering or phishing attacks.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. Compromised email accounts can lead to further attacks, data breaches, business email compromise (BEC) scams, and lateral movement within the network. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data provided, indicating a policy gap.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email accounts</li><li>Email server/service</li><li>Employee credentials</li><li>Organizational data accessible via email</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. While new employees receive initial training, the lack of recurring education leaves the workforce vulnerable to evolving social engineering tactics, sophisticated phishing attempts, malware, and other cyber threats. Without regular updates, employees may not recognize new attack vectors, increasing the likelihood of human error leading to a security incident or data breach. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li><li>Endpoint devices</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access. This will significantly enhance protection against unauthorized access to email accounts, which are frequently targeted by attackers. Additionally, the organization should establish and enforce a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees. This training should cover current threat landscapes, phishing recognition, secure browsing habits, data handling best practices, and incident reporting procedures to continuously educate and empower employees as the first line of defense. Regular policy reviews and updates are also advised to ensure alignment with evolving security standards and to address any new vulnerabilities that may arise.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational level of security readiness with MFA for critical systems and initial security training for new hires, alongside a seemingly secure external network perimeter. However, the absence of MFA for email access and the lack of recurring annual security awareness training for all employees represent notable vulnerabilities. Addressing these gaps is crucial for bolstering the organization's overall security posture, reducing the likelihood of successful cyberattacks, and protecting sensitive information from compromise. Continuous improvement in these areas will be vital for maintaining a robust defense against an ever-evolving threat landscape and ensuring long-term cybersecurity resilience.</p>
