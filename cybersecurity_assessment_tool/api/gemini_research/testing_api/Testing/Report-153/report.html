        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open port 8080 broadcasting 'TOP SECRET DB', indicating a critical exposure of a potentially sensitive database or application. Furthermore, the organization lacks Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access, which significantly elevates the risk of account compromise. Human-centric vulnerabilities are also present, as there is no security awareness training for new employees, nor is there annual security awareness training for all employees. While MFA is used for computer logins and sensitive data systems, and an acceptable use policy is in place, these critical gaps in network security and employee training pose substantial risks to the organization's overall security posture.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Database - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A network scan identified an open port 8080 on a host, which is broadcasting the title 'TOP SECRET DB'. This indicates a potentially sensitive database or application is directly exposed to the network, possibly without adequate authentication or access controls. Unauthorized access could lead to severe data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service. The previous assessment stating this port is secure appears to be incorrect based on current scan data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with open port 8080</li><li>TOP SECRET DB application/service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Email Account Compromise - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of email account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. A compromised email account can be used to launch further attacks, access sensitive information, or impersonate employees, leading to widespread organizational impact.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee email accounts</li><li>Email system</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Increased Risk of Social Engineering and Human Error - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) due to their unfamiliarity with organizational security policies and common threats. This oversight increases the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents and potential breaches.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>Organizational data and systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Stagnant Security Posture and Evolving Threat Landscape - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. Without regular training, employees may not be updated on the latest threats, phishing techniques, or evolving security policies, leading to a degradation of the overall security posture over time. This increases the risk of successful social engineering attacks and insider threats.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data and systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediate action is required to address the critical exposure of the 'TOP SECRET DB' on port 8080; this port should be secured, access restricted, and the service reviewed for proper authentication and authorization mechanisms. Furthermore, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be implemented for all email access to significantly reduce the risk of account compromise. To bolster the human element of security, mandatory security awareness training should be introduced for all new employees as part of their onboarding process. Additionally, a comprehensive annual security awareness training program for all employees is essential to keep the workforce informed about evolving threats and best practices, thereby strengthening the organization's overall resilience against cyberattacks.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks, primarily stemming from a critically exposed database and a lack of MFA for email access. These technical vulnerabilities are compounded by a deficiency in employee security awareness training, both for new hires and on an annual basis for the entire workforce. While some security measures are in place, the identified gaps indicate that the organization's current readiness is low, leaving it susceptible to data breaches, account compromises, and successful social engineering attacks. Addressing these vulnerabilities is paramount to improving the organization's security posture and protecting its sensitive assets.</p>
