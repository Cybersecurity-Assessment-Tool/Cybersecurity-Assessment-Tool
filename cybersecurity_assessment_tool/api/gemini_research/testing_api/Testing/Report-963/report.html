        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes a MySQL database service on port 3306. Furthermore, the organization lacks fundamental security controls, including the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. Critical security policies and training programs are also missing, specifically an employee acceptable use policy and regular security awareness training for both new and existing employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network, potentially allowing unauthorized access to the database if not properly secured. This direct exposure increases the attack surface and risk of data breaches. Identified via network scan.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing or credential stuffing attacks, potentially leading to business email compromise and data exfiltration. Identified via organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for logging into computers. This leaves user accounts vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are stolen or guessed, potentially leading to lateral movement within the network and system compromise. Identified via organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>User workstations</li><li>Network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not enforced for accessing sensitive data systems. This is a critical vulnerability, as it means a single compromised password could grant an attacker access to highly confidential information, leading to severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and significant reputational damage. Identified via organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Confidential information repositories</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines, employees may engage in activities that inadvertently introduce security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling company data, increasing the overall attack surface. Identified via organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of New Employee Security Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training. This means new hires may not be aware of common cyber threats, organizational security policies, or best practices, making them susceptible to social engineering attacks and increasing the risk of accidental security incidents from the outset. Identified via organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Overall security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. Without regular refreshers, employees may forget best practices, become complacent, or remain unaware of evolving threat landscapes, leading to a degradation of the human firewall and increased susceptibility to various cyberattacks. Identified via organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Overall security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, the organization should immediately implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, ideally limiting it to trusted internal IP addresses or requiring VPN access. Crucially, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be deployed across all critical access points, including email systems, computer logins, and especially sensitive data systems, to significantly enhance credential security. Furthermore, the organization needs to develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to guide appropriate conduct. Finally, a robust security awareness training program should be established, providing mandatory training for all new employees and conducting annual refreshers for the entire workforce to foster a security-conscious culture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity vulnerabilities stemming from both network exposure and critical gaps in foundational security policies and practices. The open MySQL port presents a direct attack vector, while the complete absence of Multi-Factor Authentication across key systems leaves user accounts and sensitive data highly susceptible to compromise. The lack of an acceptable use policy and regular security awareness training further exacerbates these risks by failing to establish a strong human firewall. Addressing these issues is paramount to improving the organization's overall security posture and readiness against evolving cyber threats.</p>
