        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan identified an open SSH port, indicating a potential entry point. Furthermore, an assessment of organizational practices revealed several critical gaps: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for email access, there is no formal employee acceptable use policy, and annual security awareness training for all employees is not conducted. While MFA is in place for computer logins and sensitive data systems, these other areas represent significant vulnerabilities.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nmap scan identified an open SSH (port 22) on a host within the network. While SSH is a legitimate service for remote administration, an open port increases the attack surface. If not properly secured with strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., key-based authentication, disabled password authentication, MFA) and regularly patched, it can be exploited by attackers attempting brute-force attacks or leveraging known SSH vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to the network.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with port 22 open</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. Email is a primary vector for phishing attacks and often contains sensitive information or provides access to other critical systems (e.g., password reset links). Without MFA, a compromised password (e.g., via phishing or credential stuffing) grants an attacker full access to an employee's email, leading to potential data breaches, business email compromise (BEC) scams, or further lateral movement within the network.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. An AUP defines the proper and improper use of company IT resources, data, and networks. Without clear guidelines, employees may inadvertently engage in risky behaviors (e.g., installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, sharing sensitive data inappropriately) that could introduce malware, expose confidential information, or violate compliance regulations. This increases the risk of insider threats, data leakage, and potential legal liabilities.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Organizational data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual training for all employees. Cybersecurity threats evolve rapidly, and regular, ongoing training is crucial to keep employees informed about new attack techniques (e.g., advanced phishing, social engineering tactics), reinforce best practices, and maintain a strong security culture. A lack of consistent training increases the likelihood of employees falling victim to attacks, leading to security incidents and potential breaches.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is recommended to immediately implement strong security controls for the open SSH port, including disabling password authentication, enforcing key-based authentication, and restricting access by IP address. Mandate Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access to significantly reduce the risk of account compromise. Develop and implement a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) that clearly outlines acceptable conduct for IT resource usage, ensuring all employees acknowledge and understand it. Furthermore, establish a program for mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees, covering current threats and best practices to maintain a vigilant security posture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates some foundational security strengths, such as requiring MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, and providing initial security awareness training for new hires. However, significant vulnerabilities exist, particularly the lack of MFA for email, the absence of a formal acceptable use policy, and the lack of annual security awareness training. The presence of an open SSH port also presents a potential attack vector. Addressing these critical areas is paramount to enhancing the overall security posture, reducing the attack surface, and minimizing the risk of successful cyberattacks and data breaches.</p>
