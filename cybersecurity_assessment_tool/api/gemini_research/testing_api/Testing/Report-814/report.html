        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Based on the provided organizational data, the organization currently lacks several fundamental security controls. There is a significant absence of multi-factor authentication (MFA) for critical access points like email and computer logins, which are primary targets for credential-based attacks. Furthermore, the organization does not have an acceptable use policy in place, nor does it conduct security awareness training for new or existing employees. These gaps indicate a low level of security readiness and an increased risk of social engineering, phishing, and unauthorized access incidents. While MFA is used for sensitive data systems, the broader lack of MFA and security training across other critical areas significantly weakens the overall security posture.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee inboxes if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. Email accounts often contain sensitive information and can be used as a pivot point for further attacks within the network. This was identified through the organizational data indicating "No" for MFA on email.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee email accounts</li><li>Email servers</li><li>User credentials</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if user credentials are stolen or guessed. Without a second factor, a compromised password grants full access to the workstation and potentially network resources, increasing the risk of malware propagation, data exfiltration, and lateral movement by attackers. This was identified through the organizational data indicating "No" for MFA on computer logins.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network access points</li><li>User credentials</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). An AUP defines the proper use of organizational assets, including IT systems, networks, and data, by employees. Without clear guidelines, employees may inadvertently engage in risky behaviors, such as visiting malicious websites, downloading unauthorized software, or misusing company resources, leading to increased exposure to cyber threats and potential legal liabilities. This was identified through the organizational data indicating "No" for an acceptable use policy.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational IT assets</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of New Employee Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often unfamiliar with the organization's specific security policies, common threats, and best practices. This makes them particularly susceptible to social engineering attacks, phishing, and other human-centric vulnerabilities, potentially introducing risks from the moment they join the organization. This was identified through the organizational data indicating "No" for new employee security awareness training.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network security</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Annual Security Awareness Training for All Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. Regular training is crucial to keep employees informed about evolving threats, reinforce security best practices, and maintain a strong security culture. Without ongoing education, employees may forget previous training, become complacent, or fail to recognize new attack vectors, increasing the likelihood of successful social engineering and other human-factor exploits. This was identified through the organizational data indicating "No" for annual security awareness training.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Overall security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and computer logins immediately. This critical step will drastically reduce the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials. Concurrently, the organization must develop and enforce a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) to clearly define expected behavior regarding IT asset usage. Furthermore, establishing a robust security awareness training program is paramount. This program should include mandatory training for all new employees upon onboarding and annual refresher training for all existing staff to ensure continuous education on current threats and best practices. These measures will collectively strengthen the human firewall and reduce the attack surface.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently exhibits a low level of cybersecurity readiness, primarily due to significant gaps in fundamental security controls. The absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for email and computer logins, coupled with the lack of an Acceptable Use Policy and comprehensive security awareness training for both new and existing employees, exposes the organization to a high risk of credential compromise, social engineering attacks, and internal misuse of resources. While MFA is utilized for sensitive data systems, the broader deficiencies create critical vulnerabilities that could lead to significant data breaches or operational disruptions. Addressing these identified risks through the recommended implementations is crucial for improving the overall security posture and protecting organizational assets.</p>
