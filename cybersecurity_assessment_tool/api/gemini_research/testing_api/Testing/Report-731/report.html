        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open port 22 (SSH) on an unspecified host, indicating a potential entry point that requires further investigation. From an organizational security posture perspective, the company has critical gaps in its Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) implementation, specifically lacking MFA for email access and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the absence of an employee acceptable use policy (AUP) introduces significant governance and behavioral risks. Positively, the organization conducts regular security awareness training for both new and existing employees, and requires MFA for computer logins, which are good practices.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed / Insecure SSH Configuration - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A critical vulnerability identified where a service, potentially SSH (port 22), is exposed or misconfigured, leading to potential unauthorized access. The high severity (CVSS 10.0) indicates that this exposure could allow an attacker to gain full control over the affected system, bypass security controls, or access sensitive data. This was identified through network scanning and vulnerability assessment.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li><li>SSH service (port 22)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks, as a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to an employee's email, leading to data breaches and business email compromise.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Access to sensitive data systems does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). This poses a critical risk, as unauthorized access to these systems could lead to severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and significant reputational and financial damage. A compromised password could grant an attacker direct access to critical information.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>Critical applications</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). This absence means there are no clear guidelines for employees regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, internet, and email, leading to potential misuse, increased risk of malware infections, data leakage, and legal liabilities due to unmanaged employee behavior.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Organizational policy</li><li>Employee conduct</li><li>IT resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches. The 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability, potentially related to an insecure SSH configuration, must be investigated and remediated by restricting access to port 22 and ensuring secure SSH configurations. Furthermore, a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) should be developed, communicated, and enforced to establish clear guidelines for IT resource usage and reduce human-factor risks. While security awareness training is in place, these policy and technical controls are crucial for a robust security posture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several critical and high-severity vulnerabilities, primarily stemming from a lack of MFA for key systems and an exposed network service. The absence of an acceptable use policy further exacerbates the risk profile. While security awareness training is a positive aspect, the overall readiness is significantly hampered by these fundamental security gaps. Addressing these issues promptly is paramount to protecting sensitive data, maintaining operational integrity, and preventing potential cyberattacks.</p>
