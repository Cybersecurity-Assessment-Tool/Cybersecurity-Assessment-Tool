        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to security with multi-factor authentication (MFA) required for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. An employee acceptable use policy is in place, and annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees. However, a gap exists in providing security awareness training for new employees. Network scanning identified an open SSH port (22), and a critical vulnerability related to localhost exposure was identified.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A critical vulnerability was identified where localhost services are exposed, potentially allowing unauthorized access or exploitation. This could lead to severe impacts such as data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service. The high CVSS score of 10.0 indicates maximum severity, signifying an immediate and significant threat to the organization's security posture.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An Nmap scan revealed that port 22, commonly used for SSH (Secure Shell), is open. While SSH is a secure protocol, an open port represents a potential attack surface if not properly secured with strong authentication, up-to-date software, and restricted access controls. Unauthorized access via SSH could lead to remote code execution or data exfiltration.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 22</li><li>SSH Service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of New Employee Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Low">Low</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks a formal security awareness training program specifically for new employees. This oversight means that new hires may not be immediately aware of critical security policies, best practices, and common threats (e.g., phishing, social engineering) from day one. This gap increases the risk of human error leading to security incidents during their initial employment period.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New Employees</li><li>Onboarding Process</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately address the 'Localhost Exposed' critical vulnerability by ensuring that no internal services are inadvertently exposed to external networks or unauthorized internal users. For the open SSH port (22), review its necessity and implement stringent access controls, strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., key-based authentication, MFA), and regular patching. Furthermore, establish and implement a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees as part of their onboarding process to ensure they are equipped with essential security knowledge from the start. Continue to enforce existing MFA policies and conduct annual security awareness training for all staff.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a solid foundation in cybersecurity with robust MFA implementation and annual security awareness training. However, the presence of a critical 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability, an open SSH port, and a gap in new employee security awareness training highlight areas requiring immediate attention. Addressing these vulnerabilities and enhancing the training program will significantly strengthen the organization's overall security posture and readiness against evolving cyber threats.</p>
