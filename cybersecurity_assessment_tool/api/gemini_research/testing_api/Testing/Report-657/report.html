        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open port 8080 exposing a service titled 'TOP SECRET DB', indicating a critical data exposure vulnerability. This contradicts a previous assessment that marked this port as secure. Furthermore, the organization lacks Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, significantly increasing the risk of account compromise. There is no formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), and new employees do not receive security awareness training, leaving them vulnerable to initial social engineering attempts. While annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees, these gaps present considerable risks to the organization's overall security posture.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open Port 8080 with Sensitive Data Exposure - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Port 8080 is open and exposes a service titled 'TOP SECRET DB'. This indicates a critical information disclosure vulnerability, potentially allowing unauthorized access to highly sensitive data. The previous assessment marked this as secure, which is incorrect based on the current scan data. This poses an immediate and severe risk of data breach.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li><li>Service 'TOP SECRET DB'</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing or credential stuffing attacks, as a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to an employee's email, leading to further internal compromise.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee email accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for logging into computers. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if passwords are stolen or guessed, potentially leading to lateral movement within the network and access to sensitive systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This means there are no formal guidelines for employees regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, increasing the risk of misuse, data breaches, and non-compliance due to undefined boundaries for employee conduct.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>IT systems</li><li>Organizational policy framework</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training during onboarding. This leaves them susceptible to common social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) and unaware of critical security best practices from the start of their employment, posing an immediate risk to the organization's security posture.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security culture</li><li>Onboarding process</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediate action is required to address the critical vulnerability on port 8080; the 'TOP SECRET DB' service must be secured or shut down, and a thorough investigation into its exposure is necessary. Implement mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and computer logins to significantly enhance credential security. Develop and enforce a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) to establish clear guidelines for IT resource usage. Furthermore, integrate mandatory security awareness training into the onboarding process for all new employees to ensure they are equipped with essential security knowledge from day one. Continue the annual security awareness training for all employees to maintain a strong security culture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization faces significant cybersecurity risks, primarily due to a critical exposed service on port 8080 and a widespread lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for key access points like email and computer logins. Policy and training gaps, specifically the absence of an AUP and security awareness training for new hires, further exacerbate these vulnerabilities. While annual training is in place, the current readiness is low, and immediate, decisive action is required to mitigate these identified risks and strengthen the overall security posture.</p>
