        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network shows an open SSH port (22), which, while necessary for remote administration, presents a potential attack surface if not properly secured. The organization has implemented MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, which is a positive step. However, a critical gap exists in email security, as MFA is not required for email access. Furthermore, the absence of security awareness training for new employees and annual training for all employees significantly increases the organization's susceptibility to social engineering and phishing attacks.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port (22) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH port (22) was identified on a host within the network. While SSH is essential for secure remote administration, an open port represents a potential entry point for attackers if not adequately secured with strong authentication, rate limiting, and regular patching. Unauthorized access could lead to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further lateral movement within the network. Identified via Nmap scan.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with open port 22</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. Email is a primary communication channel and a frequent target for phishing and credential stuffing attacks. Without MFA, a compromised password (e.g., through a phishing attack or data breach) grants an attacker full access to an employee's email, potentially leading to business email compromise (BEC), data theft, or further attacks using the compromised account. Identified via organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>All employee email accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees and lacks annual training for all employees. This leaves employees vulnerable to social engineering tactics, phishing, malware, and other human-centric attacks. A lack of awareness can lead to employees inadvertently clicking malicious links, opening infected attachments, or divulging sensitive information, thereby compromising the organization's security posture. Identified via organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Implement robust security measures for the open SSH port, including using strong, complex passwords or SSH keys, disabling root login, implementing rate limiting, and regularly patching the SSH server. Consider restricting SSH access to specific IP addresses or VPNs. Immediately enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts. This significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access even if passwords are compromised. Develop and implement a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees during onboarding. Additionally, conduct annual refresher training for all employees to keep them informed about current threats, best practices, and organizational security policies. Continue performing regular network scans and vulnerability assessments to identify and address new risks proactively.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems. However, significant vulnerabilities exist, particularly with the lack of MFA for email access and the complete absence of security awareness training. The open SSH port also requires diligent management. Addressing these critical gaps is paramount to enhancing the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and reducing its susceptibility to common attack vectors like phishing and social engineering. Proactive implementation of the recommended security measures will significantly strengthen the organization's defense against potential cyber threats.</p>
