            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network scan revealed an Nginx web server (version 1.18.0) running on port 443 (HTTPS). This version is outdated and no longer receives security updates. Internally, the organization requires MFA for email and sensitive data systems but not for computer logins. Furthermore, there is no formal employee acceptable use policy, and while new employees receive security awareness training, recurring annual training for all staff is not conducted.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for employees to log into their computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication. An attacker gaining access to a user's password could directly access their workstation, potentially leading to further internal network compromise.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Employee workstations",
                            "Internal network access points"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)",
                        "Overview": "The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy (AUP). An AUP defines the proper and acceptable use of organizational assets, systems, and networks by employees. Without a clear AUP, employees may unknowingly engage in activities that pose security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive data, leading to potential data breaches, malware infections, or compliance violations.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Insufficient Recurring Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "While the organization conducts security awareness training for new employees, it does not provide annual or regular training for all employees. Cybersecurity threats constantly evolve, and without recurring training, employees may not be aware of the latest phishing techniques, social engineering tactics, or best practices for data protection. This increases the likelihood of employees falling victim to cyberattacks, leading to potential data breaches, malware infections, or other security incidents.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                    {
                        "Risk": "Outdated Web Server Software",
                        "Overview": "The network scan identified an Nginx web server running version 1.18.0 on port 443. Nginx 1.18.0 reached its End-of-Life (EOL) in May 2021, meaning it no longer receives security updates or bug fixes. Running outdated software exposes the organization to known vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access, deface the website, or compromise the underlying server, potentially leading to data exposure or service disruption.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Web server (Nginx 1.18.0)",
                            "Port 443",
                            "Hosted web applications"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to prevent unauthorized access even if passwords are compromised. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy (AUP) to clearly define expected behavior and responsible use of company resources, thereby reducing insider risks. Establish a program for mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees to keep them informed about evolving cyber threats and best practices. Furthermore, the Nginx web server should be updated to the latest stable version or a currently supported version to patch known vulnerabilities and ensure ongoing security updates. Regular patching and vulnerability management processes should be established for all internet-facing systems.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing MFA for email and sensitive data systems and providing initial security awareness training. However, significant vulnerabilities exist, particularly with the lack of MFA for computer logins, the absence of an acceptable use policy, and insufficient recurring security awareness training. The presence of an outdated Nginx web server also poses a critical external risk. Addressing these areas is crucial to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and operational disruptions, thereby improving the overall cybersecurity readiness."
