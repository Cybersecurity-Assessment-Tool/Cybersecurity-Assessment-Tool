        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open SSH port (22), indicating a potential entry point that requires robust security measures. Internally, while Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enforced for computer logins and sensitive data systems, a critical gap exists as MFA is not required for email access, significantly increasing the risk of account compromise. Furthermore, the organization lacks a comprehensive security awareness training program for both new and existing employees, leaving it vulnerable to social engineering and human error. An existing acceptable use policy is a positive step, but its effectiveness is diminished without proper training.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A critical vulnerability was identified where a service on localhost appears to be exposed, potentially making internal services accessible from external networks. This could lead to unauthorized access to internal systems, data exfiltration, or further network penetration, posing an extreme risk to the organization's integrity and confidentiality. The exact nature of the exposed service needs further investigation.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH port (22) was detected on a host within the network. While SSH is essential for remote administration, an open port without stringent security controls (e.g., strong, key-based authentication, disabled root login, rate limiting, IP whitelisting) presents a high risk of brute-force attacks or exploitation of SSH vulnerabilities, potentially leading to unauthorized system access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 22 (SSH)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for employee email access. This significantly elevates the risk of email account compromise through phishing, credential stuffing, or password reuse attacks. A compromised email account can be used to launch further attacks, access sensitive information, or facilitate Business Email Compromise (BEC) scams, leading to financial loss and reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee email accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks a structured security awareness training program for both new hires and existing employees on an annual basis. This deficiency leaves employees susceptible to social engineering attacks, phishing scams, and other human-factor vulnerabilities. Without proper training, employees may inadvertently introduce malware, expose sensitive data, or fall victim to scams, undermining technical security controls.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data security practices</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately investigate and secure the exposed localhost service, ensuring it is not publicly accessible. For the open SSH port, implement robust security measures including disabling password authentication, enforcing key-based authentication, disabling root login, implementing rate limiting, and restricting access to trusted IP addresses only. Crucially, enable and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts to significantly reduce the risk of account compromise. Furthermore, establish and regularly conduct mandatory security awareness training for all employees, including new hires, to educate them on phishing, social engineering, data handling best practices, and password hygiene. Review and update the acceptable use policy to reflect current threats and ensure employees are aware of their responsibilities.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization faces several critical and high-severity vulnerabilities, primarily stemming from an exposed localhost service, an open SSH port with potentially inadequate controls, and a significant lack of MFA for email access. The absence of regular security awareness training further exacerbates these risks by increasing human susceptibility to attacks. While MFA is in place for computers and sensitive data, these gaps present considerable attack vectors that could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and operational disruption. Addressing these vulnerabilities promptly and implementing comprehensive security awareness programs are crucial steps to enhance the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and readiness against evolving threats.</p>
