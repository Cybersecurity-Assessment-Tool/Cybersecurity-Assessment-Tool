        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a mixed security posture. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is implemented for email and sensitive data systems, which is a strong security practice. However, MFA is not required for computer logins, presenting a potential vulnerability for endpoint access. The organization conducts security awareness training for both new and existing employees annually, which is commendable. A notable gap is the absence of an employee acceptable use policy. A network scan indicated that port 80 is closed.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unencrypted Web Server - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Port 80 is identified as open, indicating a potential web server running without encryption. Data transmitted over HTTP is unencrypted and susceptible to interception, eavesdropping, and tampering, leading to potential data breaches or compromise of sensitive information. This risk was identified during a security assessment.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is recommended to immediately close port 80 if it is not intended for public access. If a web server is required, implement HTTPS by obtaining and configuring an SSL/TLS certificate to encrypt all web traffic. Furthermore, it is crucial to implement multi-factor authentication for all computer logins to enhance endpoint security and prevent unauthorized access. The organization should also develop and enforce an employee acceptable use policy to clearly define expected behavior and security responsibilities, thereby reducing insider threats and misuse of company resources.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In conclusion, the organization exhibits strengths in MFA for critical systems and consistent security awareness training. However, the lack of MFA for computer logins and an an acceptable use policy represent significant areas for improvement. The identified unencrypted web server poses a direct risk to data confidentiality. Addressing these vulnerabilities through the recommended actions will significantly enhance the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and reduce its attack surface.</p>
