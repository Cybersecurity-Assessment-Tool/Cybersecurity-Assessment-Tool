            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization utilizes HTTPS (Nginx 1.18.0) for web services, indicating a basic level of secure communication. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is implemented for email and sensitive data systems, which is a positive security measure. However, significant gaps exist in foundational security practices. MFA is not required for computer logins, leaving workstations vulnerable to credential compromise. Furthermore, the absence of an employee acceptable use policy creates ambiguity regarding expected behavior and resource usage. New employees are not provided with security awareness training, which exposes the organization to risks during the onboarding phase, although annual training is conducted for all existing employees.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Logins",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require multi-factor authentication for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee workstations and internal systems if a single factor (e.g., password) is compromised through phishing, malware, or other means. An attacker with stolen credentials could gain direct access without an additional layer of security. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'Do you require MFA to log into computers?': 'No'.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employee workstations",
                            "Internal network access points"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)",
                        "Overview": "The organization currently lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. Without a clear AUP, employees may be unaware of the expected standards for using company IT resources, including internet access, email, software, and hardware. This can lead to misuse of company assets, increased risk of data breaches, malware infections, and potential non-compliance with industry regulations due to unmanaged employee behavior. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'Does your organization have an employee acceptable use policy?': 'No'.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                    {
                        "Risk": "Insufficient Security Awareness Training for New Employees",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct security awareness training specifically for new employees during their onboarding process. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering attacks, such as phishing, as they may be less familiar with company-specific security policies, procedures, and common threat vectors. This oversight leaves the organization vulnerable during a critical period when employees are integrating into the company environment. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'Does your organization do security awareness training for new employees?': 'No'.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "New employees",
                            "Email systems",
                            "Internal applications",
                            "Overall security posture"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement multi-factor authentication for all computer logins to protect against credential theft. A comprehensive employee acceptable use policy should be developed, communicated, and enforced to establish clear guidelines for IT resource usage and mitigate risks associated with employee behavior. Furthermore, mandatory security awareness training should be introduced for all new employees as part of their onboarding process to educate them on common threats and company security protocols from day one. Regularly review and update the Nginx server to ensure it is running a supported version with the latest security patches.",
            "Conclusion": "While the organization has established some critical security controls, such as MFA for email and sensitive data, and annual security awareness training, there are notable vulnerabilities that require immediate attention. The lack of MFA for computer logins, the absence of an acceptable use policy, and the omission of security training for new employees represent significant risks that could lead to unauthorized access, data compromise, and operational disruptions. Addressing these areas will substantially improve the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and resilience against evolving threats."
