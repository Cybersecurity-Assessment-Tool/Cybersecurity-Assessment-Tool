        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network has an open MySQL port (3306), indicating a potential database exposure. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required for email access, it is not enforced for computer logins or sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct security awareness training for new employees, although annual training is provided for all staff.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network. This exposes the database to potential unauthorized access, data breaches, and denial-of-service attacks if not properly secured. This vulnerability was identified through a network scan that showed port 3306 as open and listening.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is crucial to immediately implement firewall rules to restrict unauthorized access to MySQL port 3306. For a long-term solution, consider securing database access via a Virtual Private Network (VPN). Additionally, enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and sensitive data systems to enhance access control. Develop and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy and introduce mandatory security awareness training for all new employees to establish a strong security foundation from the start.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces a significant security risk due to an exposed MySQL database, which could lead to unauthorized access and data breaches. Compounding this, there are critical gaps in the security posture, including the absence of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, a lack of an employee acceptable use policy, and no security awareness training for new hires. While annual security training and MFA for email are positive steps, these unaddressed vulnerabilities significantly increase the organization's attack surface and overall risk profile.</p>
