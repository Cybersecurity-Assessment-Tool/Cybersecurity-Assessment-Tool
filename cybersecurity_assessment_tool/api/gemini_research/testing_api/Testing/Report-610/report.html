        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems, and by having an employee acceptable use policy in place. However, the absence of MFA for computer logins and a complete lack of security awareness training for both new and existing employees represent significant gaps in the organization's security posture. The provided network scan data was empty, indicating no specific network-level vulnerabilities were identified through automated scanning in this assessment.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Authentication for Computer Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network access points</li><li>Domain controllers</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Onboarding Security Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. This leaves new hires vulnerable to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) and unaware of critical security policies and best practices from the start, increasing the overall human risk factor. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Ongoing Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not provide security awareness training to all employees at least once per year. Without regular training, employees may forget best practices, become complacent, or fail to recognize new and evolving threats, making the organization more susceptible to human-error-related security incidents. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization implements Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to enhance access security and prevent unauthorized access from compromised credentials. Furthermore, a comprehensive security awareness training program should be established. This program must include mandatory training for all new employees during their onboarding process to instill security best practices from day one. Additionally, annual security awareness training should be provided to all employees to ensure continuous education on evolving threats, reinforce security policies, and maintain a strong security-conscious culture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has taken positive steps by implementing MFA for email and sensitive data systems and having an acceptable use policy, significant vulnerabilities exist due to the absence of MFA for computer logins and a complete lack of security awareness training. These gaps expose the organization to elevated risks of unauthorized access and human-error-induced security incidents. Addressing these areas is crucial for improving the overall security posture and readiness against cyber threats.</p>
