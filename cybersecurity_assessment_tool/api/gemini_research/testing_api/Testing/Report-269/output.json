            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network scan revealed an open Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) port (3389) exposed to the internet, indicating a critical external attack surface. Internally, the organization requires MFA for email and sensitive data systems, which is a positive security measure. However, there are significant gaps in internal security posture, including the lack of MFA for computer logins, the absence of an employee acceptable use policy, and infrequent security awareness training for all employees. These internal weaknesses, combined with the external RDP exposure, present a notable risk profile.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "RDP Exposure",
                        "Overview": "Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed directly to the internet via port 3389. This allows potential attackers to attempt brute-force attacks or exploit known RDP vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to internal systems. The impact could range from unauthorized access to data exfiltration or system compromise. This was identified through a network scan showing port 3389 open.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                    {
                        "Risk": "No MFA for Computer Login",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for employees to log into their computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised through phishing, keyloggers, or other means. Without a second factor, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's workstation and potentially the internal network. This was identified through the organizational security policy questionnaire.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                    {
                        "Risk": "No Acceptable Use Policy",
                        "Overview": "The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy (AUP). Without a clear AUP, employees may not understand their responsibilities regarding the use of company IT resources, data handling, and internet usage. This can lead to risky behaviors, data breaches, and non-compliance with regulations. The absence of this policy was identified through the organizational security policy questionnaire.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                    {
                        "Risk": "Infrequent Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual training for all employees. This means employees may not be kept up-to-date on the latest threats, best practices, and organizational policies, leading to a degradation of security awareness over time. This increases the risk of successful phishing attacks, social engineering, and other human-factor vulnerabilities. This was identified through the organizational security policy questionnaire.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "Organizational security posture"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately close the externally exposed RDP port 3389. If RDP access is required, it should be secured via a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or a secure gateway, ensuring only authenticated and authorized users can access it. Furthermore, the organization must implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised. A comprehensive employee acceptable use policy should be developed and enforced to clearly define appropriate use of company resources and data handling. Finally, regular, at least annual, security awareness training for all employees is crucial to maintain a strong security culture and educate staff on evolving threats and best practices.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces critical external exposure due to an open RDP port and significant internal vulnerabilities related to authentication, policy, and ongoing employee training. While some security measures like MFA for email and sensitive data are in place, the lack of MFA for computer logins, an acceptable use policy, and annual security awareness training for all employees leaves the organization susceptible to various attack vectors, including unauthorized access, data breaches, and social engineering. Addressing these identified risks is paramount to improving the overall cybersecurity readiness and reducing the attack surface."
