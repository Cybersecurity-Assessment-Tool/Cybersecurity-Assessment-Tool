        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently presents several significant security vulnerabilities. A critical finding from the network scan is an open FTP service (vsftpd 2.3.4) allowing anonymous login, which poses a direct risk of unauthorized data access or manipulation. Furthermore, the organization's internal policies reveal a lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and computer logins, significantly increasing the risk of account compromise. While MFA is used for sensitive data systems, this inconsistency leaves other critical access points exposed. Employee security awareness training is conducted annually for all staff, but new employees do not receive initial training, creating a potential gap in their understanding of security protocols during their onboarding period. Additionally, a substantial risk identified is the continued use of Windows 7 on workstations, an operating system that has reached end-of-life and no longer receives security updates, making these systems highly susceptible to exploitation.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Anonymous FTP Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The FTP service running on port 21 (vsftpd 2.3.4) is configured to allow anonymous login. This configuration permits unauthenticated users to access the FTP server, potentially leading to unauthorized viewing, modification, or uploading of files, which could compromise data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. This vulnerability was identified via an Nmap scan with the 'ftp-anon' script.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>FTP Server (port 21)</li><li>vsftpd 2.3.4</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of email account compromise through common attack vectors such as phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing, as a single compromised password would grant full access to an employee's email. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email System</li><li>Employee Accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This leaves workstations and potentially the internal network vulnerable to unauthorized access if user credentials are stolen, guessed, or compromised through other means, as a single factor (password) is the only barrier to entry. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations</li><li>Network Access Points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While the organization conducts annual security awareness training for all employees, new employees do not receive initial security awareness training upon joining. This gap means new hires may operate without a foundational understanding of the organization's security policies, common threats (e.g., phishing), and best practices during their critical initial employment period, making them more susceptible to social engineering and other attacks. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New Employees</li><li>Organizational Security Posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Windows Operating System - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Several computers within the organization are running Windows 7. Windows 7 has reached its end-of-life and no longer receives security updates or patches from Microsoft. This makes these systems highly vulnerable to known exploits and newly discovered security flaws, posing a critical risk to data and network integrity if compromised. This was identified through existing vulnerability reports.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations running Windows 7</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately disable anonymous FTP access and ensure all FTP services require strong authentication. Furthermore, the organization must implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, specifically for email access and computer logins, to significantly enhance credential security. A comprehensive security awareness training program should be established to include mandatory initial training for all new employees, in addition to the existing annual training. Most critically, all workstations running Windows 7 must be upgraded to a currently supported operating system, such as Windows 10 or 11, to ensure they receive vital security updates. Regular vulnerability scanning and patching cycles should be established for all network devices and software, and a robust incident response plan should be developed and tested.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The current cybersecurity posture of the organization indicates several critical and high-severity vulnerabilities, primarily stemming from outdated software, inadequate authentication mechanisms, and gaps in employee training. The presence of anonymous FTP access, the lack of MFA for email and computer logins, and the continued use of end-of-life Windows 7 operating systems collectively present a significant attack surface. While an acceptable use policy is in place and MFA is used for sensitive data systems, these measures are insufficient to counteract the identified weaknesses. Addressing these vulnerabilities promptly through system upgrades, policy enforcement, and enhanced training is crucial to improve the organization's overall security readiness and protect against potential cyber threats.</p>
