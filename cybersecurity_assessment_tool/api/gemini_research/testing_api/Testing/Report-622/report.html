        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a mixed approach to cybersecurity readiness. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is mandated for computer logins and annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees, there are significant gaps in critical areas. Specifically, MFA is not required for accessing email or sensitive data systems, and new employees do not receive security awareness training. An acceptable use policy is in place.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee inboxes if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or other means. Email often serves as a primary vector for further attacks and contains sensitive information. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on email access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not enforced for accessing systems containing sensitive data. This poses a critical risk, as a single compromised credential could grant an attacker full access to confidential information, leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and severe reputational damage. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on sensitive data systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>Cloud storage</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not provide security awareness training for new employees. This leaves new hires vulnerable to common social engineering tactics, phishing attempts, and other cyber threats from the outset of their employment. Untrained employees are more likely to make security mistakes, potentially introducing malware, facilitating unauthorized access, or exposing sensitive information. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for security awareness training for new employees.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational network</li><li>Data assets</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and, critically, for all sensitive data systems. This will provide a robust layer of defense against credential theft. Furthermore, a comprehensive security awareness training program should be established for all new employees, ensuring they are equipped with essential cybersecurity knowledge from day one. Regular, engaging training for all employees should continue to reinforce best practices and address emerging threats.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several notable vulnerabilities primarily stemming from gaps in its security policies and employee training. While some good practices are in place, the absence of MFA for email and sensitive data systems, coupled with a lack of initial security awareness training for new hires, leaves the organization susceptible to significant cyber risks. Addressing these areas is crucial for improving overall readiness and protecting critical assets.</p>
