        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a commendable commitment to security through its implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and sensitive data systems, as well as robust security awareness training programs for all employees. An acceptable use policy is also in place. However, a critical gap exists in the protection of email access, which currently does not mandate MFA.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks. If an attacker gains access to an employee's email, it can lead to further internal system compromise, data exfiltration, business email compromise (BEC) scams, and reputational damage. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on email access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>User accounts</li><li>Organizational data</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>It is strongly recommended to immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts across the organization. This critical security measure will significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and account compromise. Furthermore, while existing security awareness training is good, specific training modules on the importance of MFA and how to identify and report phishing attempts targeting email credentials should be reinforced. Regular reviews of access policies and security configurations are also advised to ensure continuous improvement.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization has a solid foundation in security practices, including MFA for critical systems and comprehensive security awareness training. However, the absence of MFA for email access represents a significant and high-severity vulnerability that could undermine other security controls. Addressing this gap is paramount to enhancing the overall security posture and readiness against prevalent cyber threats.</p>
