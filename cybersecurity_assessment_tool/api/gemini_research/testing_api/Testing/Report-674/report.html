        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization operates a network that includes an FTP server with an outdated version (vsftpd 2.3.4) allowing anonymous access. Several workstations are running Windows 7, an end-of-life operating system. Furthermore, the organization exhibits significant gaps in its security policies and practices, notably the complete absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. There is also a lack of an employee acceptable use policy and no security awareness training for new or existing employees. These factors collectively indicate a low level of security readiness and a high exposure to various cyber threats.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Operating System - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Computers are running Windows 7, which is an end-of-life operating system. This means it no longer receives security updates, making systems highly vulnerable to known and newly discovered exploits. The impact includes potential data breaches, system compromise, and non-compliance with security standards.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Anonymous FTP Access Allowed - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The FTP server (vsftpd 2.3.4) allows anonymous login, which means anyone can connect to the server without credentials. This can lead to unauthorized access to files, potential data exfiltration, or even the uploading of malicious content if write permissions are misconfigured. The service version (vsftpd 2.3.4) is also old and known to have vulnerabilities.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>FTP Server (port 21)</li><li>vsftpd 2.3.4</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No MFA for Critical Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email, logging into computers, or accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised through phishing or other attacks, as a single factor (password) is the only barrier.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email systems</li><li>User login systems</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This means there are no clear guidelines for employees on the proper and secure use of company IT resources, data, and internet access. This can lead to misuse of resources, increased risk of malware infections, data leakage, and legal liabilities.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>IT resources</li><li>Data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees, nor does it provide annual training for all employees. This leaves employees unprepared to identify and respond to common cyber threats like phishing, social engineering, and malware. A lack of training significantly increases the human element risk, making the organization more susceptible to breaches.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately disable anonymous FTP access and update the vsftpd server to a current, supported version, or replace it with a more secure file transfer solution. All workstations running Windows 7 must be upgraded to a supported operating system like Windows 10 or 11; a long-term strategy should include a hardware refresh cycle to support modern OS requirements. Implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points—email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems—is paramount to significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access. The organization must develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to guide secure behavior. Crucially, a robust security awareness training program should be established, including mandatory training for all new hires and annual refresher training for all employees, to educate them on identifying and responding to cyber threats.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces a high level of cybersecurity risk due to a combination of outdated software, critical configuration weaknesses (anonymous FTP), and significant deficiencies in fundamental security policies and employee training. The absence of MFA for critical systems, coupled with an end-of-life operating system on workstations, creates easily exploitable entry points for attackers. Without immediate and comprehensive remediation efforts, the organization remains highly vulnerable to data breaches, system compromises, and operational disruptions. Improving security readiness requires a multi-faceted approach addressing technical vulnerabilities, policy gaps, and human factors.</p>
