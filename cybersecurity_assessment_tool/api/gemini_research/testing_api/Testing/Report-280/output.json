            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network scan data provided minimal information, indicating no open ports were identified on the scanned host, which suggests a potentially hardened external perimeter or limited scope of the scan. Internally, the organization demonstrates a mixed security posture. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enforced for computer logins and sensitive data systems, it is notably absent for email access. Furthermore, while annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees, there is a critical gap in providing this training to new employees upon onboarding.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Email Access",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. If an attacker gains access to an employee's email, it can lead to further internal network access, data exfiltration, business email compromise (BEC) scams, and impersonation. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Email system",
                            "Employee accounts",
                            "Organizational data"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "No Security Awareness Training for New Employees",
                        "Overview": "New employees are not provided with security awareness training upon joining the organization. This leaves them vulnerable to common social engineering tactics, phishing attempts, and other cybersecurity threats from day one. Without proper training, new hires may inadvertently introduce risks to the organization by falling for scams, mishandling sensitive information, or failing to follow security protocols. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "New employees",
                            "Organizational data",
                            "Internal network"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "It is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access. This critical control will significantly reduce the risk of email account compromise. Additionally, a comprehensive security awareness training program must be established for all new employees, to be completed as part of their onboarding process. This training should cover essential topics such as phishing identification, password hygiene, data handling best practices, and incident reporting procedures. Regular, engaging, and updated security awareness training for all employees should also continue annually to reinforce good security practices.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization exhibits a foundational understanding of security by implementing MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, and conducting annual security awareness training. However, the absence of MFA for email access and the lack of security awareness training for new employees represent significant vulnerabilities that could lead to severe security incidents. Addressing these gaps is crucial for enhancing the overall security posture and readiness against evolving cyber threats."
