        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's current security posture, based on provided organizational data, indicates a mixed readiness level. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required for email access and annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees, significant gaps exist in other critical areas. Specifically, MFA is not mandated for computer logins or access to sensitive data systems. Furthermore, there is no established employee acceptable use policy, and new employees do not receive initial security awareness training. Due to broken network scan data and current risks information, a comprehensive technical vulnerability assessment of the network infrastructure could not be performed.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for employees to log into their computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if employee credentials are compromised through phishing, keyloggers, or other means. A single factor (password) is insufficient to protect against modern cyber threats, making endpoints vulnerable.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Access to systems containing sensitive data is not protected by Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). This poses a critical risk, as compromised credentials could grant attackers direct access to confidential information, leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and severe reputational damage. Sensitive data systems are prime targets for adversaries.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts with access to sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines, employees may inadvertently engage in activities that compromise security, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling company data. This absence creates ambiguity regarding expected behavior and accountability for IT resource usage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training upon joining the organization. This leaves them vulnerable to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) from day one, potentially making them an easy target for attackers seeking initial access to the company network or sensitive information. It also means they may be unaware of critical security protocols and best practices.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Company network</li><li>Data assets</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and, critically, for all sensitive data systems. Developing and enforcing a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy is essential to define clear guidelines for IT resource usage and employee responsibilities. Furthermore, mandatory security awareness training should be introduced for all new employees as part of their onboarding process, in addition to the existing annual training for all staff. These measures will collectively reduce the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and human-factor vulnerabilities.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Based on the available organizational data, the organization exhibits a foundational understanding of security with MFA for email and annual security training. However, critical vulnerabilities exist due to the absence of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, a lack of an acceptable use policy, and no initial security awareness training for new hires. These gaps indicate a moderate to high readiness risk, particularly concerning unauthorized access and insider threats. Addressing these identified areas is paramount to bolstering the overall cybersecurity resilience and protecting sensitive assets, especially given the inability to assess technical network vulnerabilities from the provided broken data.</p>
