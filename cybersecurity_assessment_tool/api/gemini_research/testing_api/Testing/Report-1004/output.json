                "Summary": "The organization's network scan identified one host with an open HTTP port (port 80). Regarding organizational security practices, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for email and sensitive data systems, but not for computer logins. The organization conducts security awareness training for both new and existing employees annually. However, a notable gap is the absence of an employee acceptable use policy.",

                        "Risk": "Open HTTP Port (Port 80)",
                        "Overview": "An open HTTP port (port 80) was detected on a host within the network. This port is commonly used for unencrypted web traffic. If not properly secured or if an outdated web server is running, it could expose the organization to various web-based attacks, including information disclosure, cross-site scripting (XSS), or SQL injection. The presence of an open HTTP port was identified via an Nmap scan.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Computer Logins",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or malware. Without a second factor, a stolen password is often sufficient for an attacker to gain access to an employee's workstation and potentially the internal network. This was identified through the organizational data provided.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                            "Internal network access points"
                        ]

                    {
                        "Risk": "Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy",
                        "Overview": "The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This policy is crucial for setting clear expectations for employees regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, data, and internet access. Without it, employees may inadvertently engage in risky behaviors, such as visiting malicious websites, downloading unauthorized software, or mishandling sensitive data, leading to security incidents. This was identified through the organizational data provided.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Organizational IT resources",
                            "Employee behavior"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to significantly enhance protection against credential theft. The open HTTP port (port 80) should be securely configured or disabled; if a web service is required, ensure it uses HTTPS (port 443) with valid certificates and that the underlying web server and applications are patched and up-to-date. Furthermore, the organization must develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy, clearly outlining guidelines for IT resource usage, data handling, internet browsing, and software installation, with regular training on this policy. Continuing with regular security awareness training for all employees, emphasizing strong passwords, phishing recognition, and secure computing practices, will also contribute to a stronger security posture.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization exhibits a mixed security posture. While positive steps like MFA for email and sensitive data systems, along with consistent security awareness training, are in place, critical vulnerabilities remain. The absence of MFA for computer logins and a formal acceptable use policy, coupled with an open HTTP port, represent significant attack vectors that could be exploited. Addressing these areas is paramount to strengthening overall security readiness and reducing the organization's attack surface."
