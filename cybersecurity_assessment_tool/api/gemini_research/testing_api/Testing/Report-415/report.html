        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, alongside robust security awareness training programs for all employees and an acceptable use policy. However, a network scan revealed an open SSH port (22), indicating a potential entry point that requires scrutiny. Furthermore, a critical gap exists in access control for sensitive data systems, as MFA is not mandated for these crucial resources.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unsecured SSH Access - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The network scan identified an open SSH port (22). While SSH is a secure protocol, an open port without proper hardening (e.g., strong passwords, key-based authentication, rate limiting, IP whitelisting, disabling root login) can be a target for brute-force attacks or unauthorized access attempts. This could lead to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further network penetration.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 22</li><li>Network perimeter</li><li>SSH server</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Access Control for Sensitive Data - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information. If an attacker compromises a single set of credentials (e.g., via phishing or malware), they could gain direct access to sensitive data without an additional layer of authentication, leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li><li>Data integrity and confidentiality</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access. For the identified open SSH port (22), a thorough review of its configuration is necessary. This includes ensuring strong, unique passwords or, preferably, key-based authentication, disabling root login, implementing IP whitelisting, and configuring rate limiting to mitigate brute-force attacks. Regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing should also be conducted to proactively identify and address potential weaknesses.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization has established a good baseline for security with MFA for email and computer logins, along with consistent security awareness training. However, the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems and the presence of an open SSH port represent significant vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors. Addressing these critical areas will substantially improve the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and reduce the risk of a data breach.</p>
