            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to cybersecurity through the implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems, alongside robust security awareness training programs for all employees and an acceptable use policy. However, a critical vulnerability exists with the use of an End-of-Life web server and a significant gap in authentication controls due to the lack of MFA for computer logins. The network scan identified an Nginx web server running version 1.18.0 on port 443, indicating an active web presence.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Use of End-of-Life (EOL) Software",
                        "Overview": "Nginx version 1.18.0 is part of the 1.18.x stable branch, which has reached its End-of-Life (EOL) status. EOL software no longer receives security updates, bug fixes, or technical support from the vendor. This exposes the organization to known and future vulnerabilities that will not be patched, significantly increasing the risk of compromise. The impact could range from data breaches to service disruption. This was identified via network scanning revealing the Nginx version.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Web server (nginx 1.18.0 on port 443)"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Insufficient Authentication Controls for Workstations",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if an employee's credentials are stolen or compromised through phishing, malware, or brute-force attacks. Without MFA, a single factor (username/password) is sufficient for authentication, making it easier for attackers to gain initial access to internal systems. The impact could include lateral movement, data exfiltration, and system compromise. This was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Employee workstations",
                            "Internal network access points"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately upgrade the Nginx web server to a currently supported and patched version to ensure ongoing security updates and vendor support. Concurrently, the organization must implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to significantly enhance workstation security and prevent unauthorized access even if primary credentials are compromised. Regular vulnerability scanning and patch management processes should be established or reinforced for all network-facing services and internal systems.",
            "Conclusion": "While the organization has established a good foundation with MFA for sensitive systems and comprehensive security awareness training, the presence of an End-of-Life web server and the absence of MFA for computer logins represent critical vulnerabilities. Addressing these high-severity risks is paramount to improving the organization's overall security posture and readiness against modern cyber threats. Proactive measures in software lifecycle management and robust authentication are essential for maintaining a secure operational environment."
