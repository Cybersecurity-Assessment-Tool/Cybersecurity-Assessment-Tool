        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Based on the provided network scan data, the external network perimeter appears to be well-secured with no open ports identified by Nmap. This suggests a minimal external attack surface. However, an internal review of organizational security practices reveals significant vulnerabilities related to authentication mechanisms.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. Compromised email accounts can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and further internal network penetration. This was identified from the organizational data indicating 'Do you require MFA to access email?':'No'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email accounts</li><li>Email servers</li><li>Employee workstations</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This leaves employee workstations vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials (username/password) are compromised. An attacker gaining access to a computer can then move laterally within the network, access sensitive data, or deploy malware. This was identified from the organizational data indicating 'Do you require MFA to log into computers?':'No'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network endpoints</li><li>Active Directory/Identity Management Systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk as it means that a single compromised credential could grant an attacker direct access to confidential or proprietary information. The impact could include data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, reputational damage, and significant financial loss. This was identified from the organizational data indicating 'Do you require MFA to access sensitive data systems?':'No'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>File shares</li><li>Cloud storage</li><li>Identity Management Systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>The primary recommendation is to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points. Specifically, MFA should be mandated for email access, computer logins, and access to all sensitive data systems. This will significantly enhance the security posture by adding an essential layer of defense against credential-based attacks. Furthermore, while the organization has good practices for acceptable use policies and security awareness training, these should be continuously reinforced, especially regarding the importance of MFA and reporting suspicious activities. Regular internal vulnerability assessments and penetration testing are also recommended to identify and address any internal weaknesses.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently demonstrates a strong external network posture with no immediately apparent open ports. However, its readiness is significantly hampered by the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. This lack of MFA represents a critical internal vulnerability that could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and significant operational disruption if credentials are compromised. While security awareness training and acceptable use policies are in place, the fundamental security control of MFA is missing, leaving the organization exposed to common and impactful cyber threats. Addressing these MFA gaps is paramount to improving the overall cybersecurity readiness.</p>
