        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan indicates an open SSH port (22), which could be a potential entry point if not properly secured. A review of organizational data reveals significant gaps in security controls, particularly concerning multi-factor authentication (MFA). MFA is not required for email access, computer logins, or access to sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization lacks a comprehensive security awareness training program for both new and existing employees, increasing the risk of social engineering attacks and human error. While an acceptable use policy is in place, its effectiveness is diminished without accompanying training and robust technical controls.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce MFA for email access. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks. Compromised email accounts can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and further lateral movement within the network. This was identified through the organizational data review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email systems</li><li>Employee accounts</li><li>Sensitive communications</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MFA is not required for logging into organizational computers. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or guessed. An attacker gaining access to a computer can potentially access internal resources, install malware, or escalate privileges. This was identified through the organizational data review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All organizational computers</li><li>User accounts</li><li>Internal network resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce MFA for access to sensitive data systems. This is a critical vulnerability as it provides a single point of failure for protecting the most valuable organizational assets. If an attacker obtains credentials for these systems, they can directly access, modify, or exfiltrate sensitive data without an additional layer of authentication. This was identified through the organizational data review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>Confidential information</li><li>Intellectual property</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or annual training for all employees. This leaves the workforce susceptible to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, vishing, pretexting), malware infections via malicious links or attachments, and poor security hygiene practices. Human error is a leading cause of security incidents, and a lack of training exacerbates this risk. This was identified through the organizational data review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li><li>Email systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port (22) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A network scan revealed that SSH port 22 is open. While SSH is a legitimate service, an open port represents a potential attack surface. If not properly secured with strong passwords, key-based authentication, rate limiting, and regular patching, it can be exploited via brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or known vulnerabilities in the SSH daemon. This was identified through the network scan data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Server(s) with open port 22</li><li>Network perimeter</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Implement a comprehensive multi-factor authentication (MFA) strategy across the organization, prioritizing sensitive data systems, followed by computer logins and email access. Deploy an enterprise-grade MFA solution and enforce its use for all relevant access points. Establish and regularly conduct mandatory security awareness training for all employees, including new hires, covering topics such as phishing recognition, password hygiene, and data handling best practices. Review and harden the configuration of any systems exposing SSH port 22, ensuring strong authentication methods (e.g., SSH keys only), disabling root login, implementing IP-based access restrictions, and regularly patching the SSH daemon. Conduct regular vulnerability scans and penetration tests to identify and remediate further weaknesses.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to a lack of multi-factor authentication across critical access points and an absence of a robust security awareness training program. These deficiencies create substantial opportunities for attackers to gain unauthorized access to systems, data, and employee accounts. While an acceptable use policy is present, its effectiveness is undermined by the absence of foundational technical controls and human-factor training. The open SSH port also presents a potential entry point if not adequately secured. The organization's current readiness against common cyber threats is low, necessitating immediate action to implement MFA and comprehensive security training to improve its overall security posture.</p>
