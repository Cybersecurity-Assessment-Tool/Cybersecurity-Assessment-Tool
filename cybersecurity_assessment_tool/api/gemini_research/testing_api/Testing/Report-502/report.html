        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to foundational security controls, including comprehensive Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. An acceptable use policy is in place, and annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees. However, a gap exists in the onboarding process regarding security awareness training for new employees, which could expose the organization to initial risks.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees are not provided with dedicated security awareness training upon joining the organization. This oversight can lead to new hires being unaware of critical security policies, common threat vectors (e.g., phishing, social engineering), and best practices for data handling. The impact could range from accidental data breaches and malware infections to successful social engineering attacks, as new employees might be more susceptible due to lack of immediate education. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' to security awareness training for new employees.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li><li>Email systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Implement mandatory security awareness training as part of the onboarding process for all new employees. This training should cover essential topics such as phishing recognition, password hygiene, data classification, acceptable use policies, and incident reporting procedures. Consider making this a prerequisite for system access. Regularly update training materials to reflect current threat landscapes and ensure new hires are equipped with the necessary knowledge to protect organizational assets from their first day.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization has established a robust security posture with widespread MFA implementation and an existing annual security awareness program. These measures significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and common human-factor vulnerabilities. However, the absence of dedicated security awareness training for new employees represents a notable gap. Addressing this by integrating security training into the new hire onboarding process is crucial to ensure a consistent and strong security culture from day one, thereby enhancing overall organizational readiness against evolving cyber threats.</p>
