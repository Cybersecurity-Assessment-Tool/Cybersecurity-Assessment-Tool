        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan did not reveal any immediately exploitable open ports, indicating a basic level of perimeter security. However, a review of organizational data highlights significant internal security policy and training deficiencies. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is used for email and sensitive data systems, it is notably absent for computer logins. Furthermore, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or on an annual basis for all staff. These policy gaps represent substantial risks that could undermine the technical security measures in place.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for employees to log into their computers. This means that if an attacker compromises an employee's username and password, they can gain unauthorized access to the computer and potentially the internal network without an additional layer of verification. This significantly increases the risk of credential theft leading to broader system compromise, data breaches, and ransomware attacks.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers</li><li>Internal network access</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not have an employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines on the appropriate use of company IT resources, employees may unknowingly engage in risky behaviors such as visiting malicious websites, downloading unauthorized software, or mishandling sensitive data. This lack of policy creates an environment where security best practices are not consistently followed, increasing the organization's exposure to malware, data loss, and compliance violations.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network resources</li><li>IT systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often targets for social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) as they may be less familiar with company policies, systems, and typical communication patterns. Without initial training, new employees are more susceptible to falling victim to these attacks, which can lead to credential compromise, malware infection, and unauthorized access to internal systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Email systems</li><li>Internal network</li><li>Sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Annual Security Awareness Training for All Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. Cybersecurity threats are constantly evolving, and without regular, updated training, employees may forget best practices or not be aware of new attack vectors. This ongoing lack of training leaves the entire workforce vulnerable to sophisticated phishing campaigns, social engineering tactics, and other human-centric attacks, making them a potential weak link in the organization's security posture.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Email systems</li><li>Internal network</li><li>Sensitive data</li><li>Organizational reputation</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to protect against credential theft. A comprehensive employee acceptable use policy should be developed, communicated, and enforced to establish clear guidelines for IT resource usage. Furthermore, mandatory security awareness training must be introduced for all new employees as part of their onboarding process. This training should be reinforced with mandatory annual security awareness training for all existing employees to ensure they remain informed about evolving threats and best practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the initial network scan did not reveal immediate external vulnerabilities, the organization's current cybersecurity readiness is significantly hampered by critical gaps in its internal policies and employee training programs. The absence of MFA for computer logins, an acceptable use policy, and regular security awareness training for both new and existing employees creates substantial exposure to social engineering, credential compromise, and insider threats. Addressing these foundational weaknesses is paramount to establishing a robust security posture and protecting organizational assets from a wide range of cyber threats.</p>
