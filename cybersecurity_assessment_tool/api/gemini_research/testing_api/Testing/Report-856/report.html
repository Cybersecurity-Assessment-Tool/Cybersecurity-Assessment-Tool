        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational level of security posture, utilizing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems, and providing initial security awareness training for new employees. However, critical gaps exist in internal security controls and ongoing employee education. A network scan indicated no open ports, suggesting a potentially hardened external perimeter or limited scan scope. Despite this, the absence of MFA for computer logins, a formal acceptable use policy, and annual security awareness training for all employees introduces significant internal vulnerabilities.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Employees are not required to use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) when logging into their computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication. An attacker gaining access to a workstation could potentially pivot to other internal systems, leading to data breaches or system compromise.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Internal network access</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) for employees. Without an AUP, there are no clear guidelines defining appropriate and inappropriate use of company IT resources, data, and internet access. This can lead to misuse of company assets, increased exposure to malware, data breaches, and potential legal liabilities due to employees engaging in prohibited activities without clear understanding or consequences.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All IT systems</li><li>Employee devices</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Legal compliance</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This means that existing employees may not be updated on the latest threats, best practices, or changes in company policy, leading to a degradation of security posture over time. Employees are often the first line of defense against social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing), and lack of ongoing training increases susceptibility.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Susceptibility to social engineering attacks</li><li>Phishing defense</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins across the organization to enhance workstation security. Furthermore, develop and enforce a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), ensuring all employees acknowledge and understand its terms to establish clear guidelines for IT resource usage. Finally, establish and regularly conduct annual security awareness training for all employees, covering current threats, best practices, and policy updates to maintain a vigilant and informed workforce. While the external network scan showed no open ports, regular and comprehensive vulnerability assessments and penetration tests of both external and internal networks should be conducted to proactively identify and address any technical weaknesses.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently exhibits a mixed state of cybersecurity readiness. While some critical security measures like MFA for sensitive systems and initial employee training are in place, significant vulnerabilities stem from the lack of MFA for computer logins, the absence of a formal acceptable use policy, and the omission of annual security awareness training for all staff. These policy and human factor deficiencies represent considerable risks that could lead to unauthorized access, data compromise, or operational disruption. Addressing these internal process and training gaps is crucial for elevating the overall security posture and reducing the organization's attack surface.</p>
