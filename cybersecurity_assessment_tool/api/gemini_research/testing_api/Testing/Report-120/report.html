        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network readiness assessment reveals several critical gaps, primarily in multi-factor authentication (MFA) implementation and foundational security policies and training. While MFA is utilized for computer logins, its absence for email and sensitive data systems significantly increases the attack surface. Furthermore, the lack of an acceptable use policy and security awareness training for new employees indicates a potential for human-factor vulnerabilities and inconsistent security practices across the workforce.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks. If an attacker gains access to an employee's email, it can lead to further internal system access, data exfiltration, or business email compromise (BEC) scams. This vulnerability was identified directly from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email accounts</li><li>User credentials</li><li>Communication systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not mandated for accessing systems containing sensitive data. This poses a critical risk, as compromised credentials (e.g., through phishing or malware) could grant unauthorized users direct access to confidential information, leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and severe reputational damage. This vulnerability was identified directly from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>Confidential information repositories</li><li>User access controls</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy (AUP). Without an AUP, there are no clear guidelines for employees regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, internet, email, and data. This can lead to increased risks such as malware infections from unauthorized software installations, data leakage through improper data handling, and legal liabilities due to misuse of company assets. This vulnerability was identified directly from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network resources</li><li>Data handling practices</li><li>Organizational compliance</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training upon joining the organization. This creates a significant vulnerability as new hires may not be aware of current threats, company security policies, or best practices for protecting sensitive information. This oversight can lead to new employees inadvertently falling victim to social engineering attacks, mishandling data, or introducing malware into the network during their initial period. This vulnerability was identified directly from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employee onboarding process</li><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Organizational security culture</li><li>Human factor vulnerabilities</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and sensitive data systems. This critical step will significantly enhance protection against unauthorized access even if primary credentials are compromised. Concurrently, develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy (AUP) to clearly define expectations for IT resource usage and data handling. Furthermore, establish mandatory security awareness training for all new employees as part of their onboarding process, in addition to the existing annual training for all staff, to ensure a consistent baseline understanding of cybersecurity best practices from day one. Regularly review and update these policies and training modules to adapt to evolving threat landscapes.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to incomplete MFA implementation and foundational gaps in security policies and new employee training. While some security measures are in place, the absence of MFA for critical systems like email and sensitive data, coupled with the lack of an acceptable use policy and initial security training for new hires, leaves the organization vulnerable to various attack vectors. Addressing these areas with urgency is crucial for enhancing the overall security posture and readiness against modern cyber threats.</p>
