        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization operates a web server running Nginx version 1.18.0 on port 443 (HTTPS). While email access is protected by Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), MFA is not enforced for computer logins or access to sensitive data systems. The organization has an acceptable use policy and conducts annual security awareness training for all employees, but new employees do not receive initial security awareness training.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Nginx Server - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nginx web server identified as version 1.18.0 is End-of-Life (EOL) and no longer receives security updates. Running EOL software exposes the organization to numerous known vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers, potentially leading to data breaches, denial of service, or complete system compromise. This significantly increases the attack surface and risk of exploitation.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Nginx 1.18.0 on port 443</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or malware. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's workstation and potentially the internal network.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Internal network access</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This poses a severe risk to the confidentiality and integrity of critical information. If an attacker gains access to credentials for these systems, they can access, exfiltrate, or tamper with sensitive data without an additional layer of authentication, leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Confidential information</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training upon joining the organization. This means new hires may not be immediately aware of the organization's security policies, common threats (like phishing), and best practices, making them more susceptible to social engineering attacks and potentially introducing vulnerabilities from day one. This oversight can weaken the overall human firewall.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>It is critically important to immediately upgrade the Nginx web server to a currently supported and patched version to mitigate known vulnerabilities. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and access to sensitive data systems to significantly enhance protection against credential theft. Furthermore, establish a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees as part of their onboarding process to ensure they are equipped with essential security knowledge from day one. Regularly review and update security policies and conduct penetration testing to identify and address further weaknesses.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization faces significant security risks primarily due to an outdated web server and a lack of comprehensive Multi-Factor Authentication implementation across critical access points. While annual security training is in place, the absence of initial training for new hires presents a gap in the human element of security. Addressing these vulnerabilities is crucial for improving the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and protecting its assets from potential threats.</p>
