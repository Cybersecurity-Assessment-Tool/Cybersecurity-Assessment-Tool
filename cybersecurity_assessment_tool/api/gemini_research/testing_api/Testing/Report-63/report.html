        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to security through widespread Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, alongside an established acceptable use policy. However, a critical vulnerability was identified with an open MySQL port (3306) on the network, exposing the database. While annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees, there is a notable gap in providing this training to new employees upon onboarding.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The MySQL port 3306 is openly accessible on the network, exposing the database. This allows potential unauthorized access to sensitive data stored within the MySQL database, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service. This was identified through a network port scan revealing the open port and the running MySQL service.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted IP addresses or internal networks. For a more robust long-term solution, consider implementing a Virtual Private Network (VPN) for all database access, ensuring encrypted and authenticated connections. Additionally, to enhance the overall security posture, the organization should establish a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees as part of their onboarding process, complementing the existing annual training for all staff. This will ensure that all personnel are equipped with the necessary knowledge to identify and avoid common cyber threats from day one.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In conclusion, while the organization has implemented robust controls such as Multi-Factor Authentication across critical access points and maintains an acceptable use policy, a significant vulnerability exists with an exposed MySQL database port. This poses a high risk of unauthorized data access and potential breach. Furthermore, the absence of security awareness training for new employees represents a gap in the organization's human firewall. Addressing the database exposure with immediate firewall restrictions and long-term VPN implementation, alongside instituting new employee security training, is crucial to elevate the organization's cybersecurity readiness and protect its valuable assets.</p>
