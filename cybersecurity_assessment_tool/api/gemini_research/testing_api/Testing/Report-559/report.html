        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open SSH port (22), indicating potential remote access capabilities. A review of organizational data indicates a significant lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA) implementation across critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization does not conduct security awareness training for new or existing employees, despite having an acceptable use policy in place. This combination of factors suggests a low security readiness posture with several critical vulnerabilities.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks. Compromised email accounts can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and further lateral movement within the network. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>All employee email accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for logging into computers within the organization. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are stolen or guessed. An attacker gaining access to a computer can potentially access internal resources, install malware, or escalate privileges. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All organizational computers</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive data systems. This is a critical vulnerability as it allows single-factor authentication to protect the most valuable assets. A breach of these systems could lead to severe data loss, regulatory fines, reputational damage, and significant operational disruption. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All sensitive data systems</li><li>Associated databases</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or annually for all employees. This leaves the workforce susceptible to social engineering attacks, phishing attempts, and other human-factor vulnerabilities. Employees who are not trained on security best practices are more likely to fall victim to scams, inadvertently click malicious links, or mishandle sensitive information, thereby increasing the overall risk of a security incident. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port (22) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH port (22) was detected on the network. While SSH is a legitimate service for secure remote access, an open port presents a potential attack vector if not properly secured. Without strong authentication (e.g., MFA, key-based authentication) and strict access controls (e.g., IP whitelisting), this port can be targeted by brute-force attacks or exploited if the SSH server software has known vulnerabilities. This was identified through the network scan data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Network perimeter</li><li>SSH server</li><li>Associated systems accessible via SSH</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, immediate implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is strongly recommended across all critical access points: email systems, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. This single measure will drastically reduce the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials. Concurrently, a comprehensive security awareness training program should be established for all employees, including mandatory training for new hires and annual refreshers for existing staff, to educate them on common threats like phishing and social engineering. For the identified open SSH port (22), it is crucial to review and harden its configuration by enforcing strong authentication methods (e.g., SSH keys, MFA), restricting access to only necessary IP addresses, and ensuring the SSH server software is regularly patched and updated.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to a widespread lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, coupled with the complete absence of security awareness training for its employees. While an acceptable use policy is in place, the human element remains a critical vulnerability. The presence of an open SSH port further necessitates immediate attention to prevent potential unauthorized remote access. Without addressing these fundamental security gaps, the organization remains highly susceptible to credential-based attacks, data breaches, and social engineering exploits, indicating a low state of security readiness.</p>
