        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan data provided minimal information, indicating no open ports, which is a positive baseline but offers limited insight into internal configurations. From an organizational policy perspective, the company has an acceptable use policy in place and conducts security awareness training for new employees. However, critical gaps exist in the implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, security awareness training is not conducted annually for all employees, which can lead to a degradation of security posture over time.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unauthorized Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts through credential stuffing, phishing, or brute-force attacks. A compromised email account can serve as a gateway for further network intrusion, business email compromise (BEC) scams, and data exfiltration. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' to 'Do you require MFA to access email?'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li><li>Identity and Access Management (IAM)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access sensitive data systems. This exposes critical organizational data to a higher risk of unauthorized access if primary credentials are compromised. Attackers gaining access to these systems could lead to severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, financial losses, and significant reputational damage. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' to 'Do you require MFA to access sensitive data systems?'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>File shares</li><li>Cloud storage (if applicable)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Elevated Human-Centric Attack Surface - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. This lack of ongoing education means employees may not be updated on the latest threats, phishing techniques, or evolving company policies, increasing the likelihood of successful social engineering attacks, malware infections, and policy violations due to human error. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' to 'Does your organization do security awareness training for all employees at least once per year?'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational endpoints</li><li>Network infrastructure</li><li>Data integrity</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and sensitive data systems immediately. This single measure will drastically reduce the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials. Furthermore, a comprehensive and mandatory annual security awareness training program should be established for all employees. This training should cover current threat landscapes, phishing recognition, secure browsing habits, and company security policies to foster a strong security culture and reduce human-centric vulnerabilities. Regular reviews of access controls and data classification policies should also be conducted.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant security risks primarily due to the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for critical access points like email and sensitive data systems, alongside an infrequent security awareness training schedule for its entire workforce. While basic network hygiene appears to be maintained with no open ports identified in the scan, the human and identity layers present substantial vulnerabilities. Addressing these gaps through the immediate implementation of MFA and a robust, recurring security awareness training program is crucial for improving the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and protecting against prevalent cyber threats.</p>
