        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security by implementing MFA for email access, maintaining an employee acceptable use policy, and conducting regular security awareness training for all employees, including new hires. However, critical gaps exist in the application of multi-factor authentication for computer logins and access to sensitive data systems, which significantly increases the attack surface and potential for unauthorized access.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This means that if an attacker obtains a user's credentials (username and password), they can gain unauthorized access to the computer without needing a second form of verification. This significantly increases the risk of credential stuffing, brute-force attacks, and lateral movement within the network, potentially leading to data breaches or system compromise. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This critical oversight means that systems containing confidential or proprietary information are protected solely by a single factor (e.g., password). Should an attacker compromise a user's credentials, they would have direct, unfettered access to sensitive data, leading to potential data exfiltration, compliance violations, and severe reputational and financial damage. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>Cloud storage containing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins across the organization. Furthermore, MFA must be enforced for access to all sensitive data systems to provide an additional layer of security beyond passwords. Review and update access control policies to ensure MFA is a mandatory requirement for these critical access points. Consider a phased rollout for MFA implementation, starting with high-privilege accounts and sensitive systems, followed by a broader deployment across all user accounts and devices. Regular audits of MFA enforcement and user training on its importance should also be conducted.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has established a good baseline with MFA for email and consistent security awareness training, the absence of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems represents significant vulnerabilities. These gaps expose the organization to a high risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. Addressing these critical MFA deficiencies is paramount to enhancing the overall security posture and readiness against modern cyber threats.</p>
