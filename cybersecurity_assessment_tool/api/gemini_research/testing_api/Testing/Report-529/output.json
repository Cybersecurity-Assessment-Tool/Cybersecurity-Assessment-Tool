            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network currently exposes an Nginx web server (version 1.18.0) on port 443 (HTTPS). While sensitive data systems are protected by Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), critical access points such as email and computer logins lack MFA. Furthermore, the organization does not have an employee acceptable use policy, and security awareness training is not provided to new employees upon onboarding, although annual training is conducted for all employees.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email and Computer Login",
                        "Overview": "The absence of MFA for email accounts and computer logins significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access. If an attacker compromises employee credentials through phishing or other means, they can gain full access to email communications and internal systems without an additional layer of security. This could lead to data breaches, ransomware infections, or lateral movement within the network. This vulnerability was identified through the organization's self-reported security practices.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Email systems",
                            "Employee workstations/laptops"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Outdated/End-of-Life Web Server Software (Nginx 1.18.0)",
                        "Overview": "The Nginx web server running on port 443 is version 1.18.0, which is an End-of-Life (EOL) version. EOL software no longer receives security updates or patches for newly discovered vulnerabilities. This exposes the organization to known and potential future exploits, increasing the risk of remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure through the public-facing web server. This was identified during the network scan.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Web server (nginx 1.18.0 on port 443)"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)",
                        "Overview": "The organization lacks a formal Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). Without clear guidelines, employees may be unaware of their responsibilities regarding the use of company assets, data handling, internet usage, and security protocols. This increases the risk of accidental data leaks, introduction of malware, or inappropriate use of company resources, potentially leading to security incidents or compliance issues. This was identified through the organization's self-reported policies.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "Organizational data",
                            "Network resources"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of Security Awareness Training for New Employees",
                        "Overview": "While annual security awareness training is conducted, new employees do not receive specific training upon onboarding. This leaves new hires vulnerable to social engineering attacks, such as phishing and pretexting, during their initial period with the organization. Without immediate training on security best practices, they are more likely to inadvertently introduce malware, compromise credentials, or fall victim to scams, posing a risk to the organization's security posture. This was identified through the organization's self-reported training practices.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "New employees",
                            "Email systems",
                            "Internal network"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and computer logins to significantly enhance protection against credential compromise. The Nginx web server should be immediately upgraded to the latest stable or a currently supported Long-Term Support (LTS) version to ensure it receives critical security updates and patches. Furthermore, the organization must develop and enforce a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) to clearly define employee responsibilities regarding IT assets and data. Finally, mandatory security awareness training should be established for all new hires as part of their onboarding process, in addition to the existing annual training, to ensure immediate awareness of security best practices.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to critical gaps in access control mechanisms (lack of MFA for email and computer login), the use of outdated and unsupported public-facing software (Nginx 1.18.0), and deficiencies in foundational security policies and training (absence of AUP and new employee security training). While MFA is used for sensitive data systems, the broader lack of it for common access points, combined with an exposed EOL web server, creates a substantial attack surface. Addressing these vulnerabilities promptly is crucial to improving the organization's overall security posture and reducing the likelihood of a successful cyberattack."
