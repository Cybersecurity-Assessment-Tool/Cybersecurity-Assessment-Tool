        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes a MySQL database (version 5.7.33) on port 3306, indicating a potential direct access vulnerability. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required for computer logins, it is notably absent for email access and sensitive data systems, creating significant authentication weaknesses. Furthermore, the organization has an acceptable use policy in place, but lacks crucial security awareness training for both new hires and existing employees on an annual basis, which could lead to increased susceptibility to social engineering and human error.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network, allowing direct access to the database. This exposes the MySQL 5.7.33 instance to potential unauthorized access, brute-force attacks, or exploitation of known vulnerabilities in this specific version, leading to data compromise or service disruption. This was identified through network scanning.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive communications, business email compromise (BEC), and further lateral movement within the network. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email accounts</li><li>User credentials</li><li>Communication systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are compromised, increasing the risk of data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and significant financial and reputational damage. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Critical databases</li><li>User accounts with access to sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks security awareness training for new employees and does not conduct annual training for all employees. This leaves the workforce susceptible to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) and unaware of best practices for data protection, increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents, malware infections, and data loss. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network security</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted internal IP addresses or via a secure VPN. Furthermore, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be mandated for all email access and sensitive data systems to significantly enhance credential security. The organization should also establish a comprehensive security awareness training program, including mandatory training for all new hires and annual refresher courses for all employees, to educate staff on common threats and best security practices. Leveraging the existing acceptable use policy to reinforce these security measures is also advised.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several significant cybersecurity vulnerabilities, including an exposed database service, critical gaps in Multi-Factor Authentication implementation for email and sensitive data systems, and a complete absence of security awareness training for its workforce. While an acceptable use policy is in place, these unaddressed technical and human-factor risks indicate a moderate to high overall risk posture, requiring immediate attention to prevent potential data breaches, unauthorized access, and operational disruptions.</p>
