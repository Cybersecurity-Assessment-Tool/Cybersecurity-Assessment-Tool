        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open RDP port (3389), indicating potential exposure for remote desktop services. While the organization implements MFA for computer logins and has an acceptable use policy and new employee security training, there are gaps in MFA adoption for email and sensitive data systems. Additionally, annual security awareness training for all employees is not consistently performed.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>RDP Exposure - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed to the internet via an open port (3389). This allows external entities to attempt to connect to internal systems, increasing the risk of brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, and unauthorized access. This was identified through a network scan showing port 3389 as open.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, credential theft, or brute-force attacks, as a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to an employee's email. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access sensitive data systems. This poses a significant risk, as unauthorized access to these systems, even with a compromised password, could lead to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and severe reputational damage. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inconsistent Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. This leaves employees vulnerable to evolving social engineering tactics, phishing attempts, and other cyber threats, as their knowledge of best security practices may become outdated. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately close the exposed RDP port (3389) and implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) for secure remote access. Furthermore, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) should be mandated for all email access and sensitive data systems to significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and account compromise. The organization should also establish and enforce a policy for mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees to ensure up-to-date knowledge of cybersecurity best practices and threat landscapes.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces critical and high-severity risks primarily due to an exposed RDP service and significant gaps in Multi-Factor Authentication implementation for email and sensitive data systems. While some foundational security controls are in place, the lack of comprehensive MFA and consistent annual security awareness training leaves the organization vulnerable to sophisticated cyberattacks. Addressing these critical areas is paramount to improving the overall cybersecurity posture and readiness.</p>
