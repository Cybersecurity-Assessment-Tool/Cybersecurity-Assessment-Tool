        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security awareness training for both new and existing employees, along with an acceptable use policy. However, significant vulnerabilities exist regarding authentication mechanisms and potential exposure of sensitive internal systems. Specifically, while Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for email access, it is notably absent for computer logins and access to sensitive data systems, creating substantial attack vectors. Furthermore, a network scan revealed an open port 8080 hosting a service titled 'TOP SECRET DB,' indicating a critical exposure of potentially sensitive internal resources.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed Sensitive Database - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An Nmap scan identified an open port 8080 with the HTTP title 'TOP SECRET DB'. This indicates a potentially sensitive database or application accessible from the network, possibly without proper authentication or authorization. This poses a critical risk of data breach, unauthorized access, and compromise of confidential information.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li><li>Service 'TOP SECRET DB'</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Weak Authentication for Computer Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if user credentials are stolen or compromised, as a single factor (password) is insufficient to protect against modern attack vectors like phishing and brute-force attacks. A successful compromise could lead to lateral movement within the network.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers</li><li>Network login systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Weak Authentication for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if user credentials are compromised. A breach of these systems could lead to severe data loss, regulatory non-compliance, financial penalties, and significant reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts with access to sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediate action is required to address the critical exposure on port 8080 by securing or removing the 'TOP SECRET DB' service from public or internal network access, implementing strong authentication, and ensuring proper access controls. Furthermore, the organization must prioritize the implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and access to sensitive data systems to significantly enhance account security and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials. Regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing should be conducted to identify and remediate similar exposures proactively. Additionally, a review of access controls for sensitive systems should be performed.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces critical and high-severity risks primarily due to inadequate authentication controls for core systems and the potential exposure of a sensitive internal database. While security awareness training and acceptable use policies provide a foundational layer, the absence of MFA for computer and sensitive data access, coupled with the identified 'TOP SECRET DB' exposure, indicates a significant gap in the organization's overall security posture and readiness against sophisticated cyber threats. Addressing these vulnerabilities is paramount to protecting sensitive information and maintaining operational integrity.</p>
