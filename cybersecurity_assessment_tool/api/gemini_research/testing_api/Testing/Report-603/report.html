        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, and maintaining an employee acceptable use policy. Annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees. However, a critical gap exists in the onboarding process, as new employees do not receive initial security awareness training. Network scanning identified an open MySQL port (3306) running version 5.7.33, which presents a direct exposure risk.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network. This exposes the database service (MySQL 5.7.33) to potential unauthorized access or exploitation, especially if not properly secured with strong authentication and access controls. An open database port significantly increases the attack surface for external and internal threats.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li><li>MySQL Database Server</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of New Employee Security Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees are not receiving security awareness training as part of their onboarding process. This oversight creates a significant vulnerability, as new hires may inadvertently introduce risks through phishing susceptibility, poor password practices, or a lack of understanding of organizational security policies and best practices from day one. This gap can lead to accidental data breaches or system compromise.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement strict firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted IP addresses or via a secure VPN. Additionally, ensure the MySQL database itself is configured with strong authentication, least privilege access controls, and is regularly patched. For the human-factor vulnerability, a mandatory security awareness training program must be integrated into the onboarding process for all new employees. This training should cover essential topics such as phishing, social engineering, password hygiene, and the organization's acceptable use policy, ensuring all personnel are equipped with foundational security knowledge from their first day.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has robust controls in place for MFA and annual security training, the open MySQL port and the absence of initial security awareness training for new employees represent significant vulnerabilities. Addressing these specific gaps is crucial to enhancing the overall security posture, reducing the attack surface, and minimizing the risk of data breaches or system compromise. Proactive measures in these areas will significantly improve the organization's readiness against evolving cyber threats.</p>
