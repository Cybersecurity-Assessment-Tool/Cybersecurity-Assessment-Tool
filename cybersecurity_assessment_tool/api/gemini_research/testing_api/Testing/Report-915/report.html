        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open MySQL port (3306) running version 5.7.33. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required for email access, it is not enforced for computer logins or access to sensitive data systems. The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct security awareness training for new employees, although annual training is provided for all employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The MySQL database port 3306 is openly accessible on the network. This exposure allows potential attackers to attempt unauthorized access to the database, which could lead to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service if vulnerabilities in MySQL are exploited. The presence of an open database port without adequate network segmentation or access controls significantly increases the attack surface.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for employees to log into their computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised through phishing, keylogging, or brute-force attacks. Without a second factor, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's workstation and potentially the internal network.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee computer logins</li><li>Internal network access</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk, as compromised credentials could allow unauthorized individuals direct access to confidential information, leading to severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and significant reputational damage. Sensitive data systems are prime targets for attackers, and the absence of MFA makes them highly vulnerable.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Confidential information</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not have an employee acceptable use policy (AUP) in place. Without a clear AUP, employees may be unaware of their responsibilities regarding the use of company IT resources, data handling, and internet usage. This lack of guidance can lead to risky behaviors, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive data, increasing the likelihood of security incidents and legal liabilities.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee behavior</li><li>IT resource usage</li><li>Data handling practices</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often the most vulnerable to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) and may not be familiar with the organization's specific security protocols and best practices. This oversight leaves the organization exposed to risks introduced by new employees who may inadvertently fall victim to attacks or violate security policies due to a lack of initial education.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Phishing susceptibility</li><li>Internal security protocols</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement robust firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted internal IP addresses or specific application servers. For long-term security, consider placing the database behind a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or implementing a secure bastion host for administrative access. Immediately enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and, critically, for access to all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access even if passwords are compromised. Develop and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy (AUP) that clearly outlines expectations for IT resource usage and data handling. Furthermore, establish mandatory security awareness training for all new employees as part of their onboarding process, in addition to the existing annual training, to ensure a consistent baseline of security knowledge across the entire workforce.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant security vulnerabilities, particularly concerning database exposure and the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for critical access points like computer logins and sensitive data systems. The absence of an acceptable use policy and initial security training for new employees further exacerbates the risk posture. While annual security training is a positive step, these gaps indicate a need for immediate and comprehensive improvements in network security, access controls, and employee security education to enhance overall readiness against cyber threats.</p>
