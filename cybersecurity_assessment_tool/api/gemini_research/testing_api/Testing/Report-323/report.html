        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open SSH port (22), indicating a potential entry point that requires robust security measures. While MFA is implemented for email access, a critical gap exists as MFA is not required for computer logins or access to sensitive data systems, significantly increasing the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are compromised. Furthermore, the absence of an employee acceptable use policy leaves the organization vulnerable to misuse of resources and potential insider threats. Positively, the organization conducts security awareness training for both new and existing employees, which is a foundational element of a strong security posture.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A critical vulnerability was identified where internal services or sensitive data appear to be accessible via the localhost interface. This misconfiguration, if exploited by an attacker who gains initial access to a system, could lead to privilege escalation, unauthorized data access, or further compromise of the internal network. The high severity indicates a direct and significant impact on confidentiality, integrity, or availability.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>System's localhost network interface</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee workstations and, subsequently, the internal network, should an attacker compromise user credentials through phishing, brute-force, or other means. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant full access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers</li><li>Network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not mandated for accessing sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk, as compromised credentials could allow unauthorized individuals direct access to confidential information, intellectual property, or critical operational data. The absence of this crucial security layer makes these systems highly vulnerable to data breaches and compliance violations.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>File shares containing sensitive information</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. This absence creates ambiguity regarding appropriate conduct, usage of company resources, and data handling practices. It increases the risk of employees inadvertently or intentionally misusing company assets, introducing malware, or mishandling sensitive information, potentially leading to security incidents, data loss, or legal liabilities.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT assets</li><li>Data handling procedures</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately investigate and remediate the 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability by ensuring no sensitive services or data are accessible via the localhost interface without proper authentication and authorization. Review network configurations, firewall rules, and service bindings to restrict access to only necessary interfaces. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all computer logins and for access to all sensitive data systems to significantly enhance protection against credential compromise. Furthermore, develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to clearly define appropriate behavior, usage of company resources, and data handling practices, thereby reducing insider threats and misuse. Regular audits of open ports and services should be conducted to ensure only essential services are exposed and properly secured.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security through its employee awareness training and MFA for email. However, significant vulnerabilities exist, particularly the critical 'Localhost Exposed' issue and the absence of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, which represent major attack vectors. The lack of an acceptable use policy also highlights a gap in governance. Overall, the organization's current security readiness is moderate, with several high and critical risks requiring immediate attention and strategic implementation of security controls to prevent potential breaches and unauthorized access.</p>
