        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an Nginx web server (version 1.18.0) running on port 443 (HTTPS). Organizational data indicates that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required for email and sensitive data systems, which is a positive security measure. However, MFA is not required for computer logins. Furthermore, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct security awareness training for either new or existing employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The absence of MFA for computer logins significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to internal systems. If an employee's credentials are compromised through phishing or other means, an attacker could easily gain access to their workstation and potentially move laterally within the network without an additional layer of authentication. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'Do you require MFA to log into computers?': 'No'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Internal network access</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Without an established Employee Acceptable Use Policy, employees may not be fully aware of their responsibilities regarding the use of company IT assets, data, and network resources. This lack of clear guidelines can lead to misuse of company resources, increased risk of data breaches due to improper handling of sensitive information, and potential legal or compliance issues. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'Does your organization have an employee acceptable use policy?': 'No'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT assets</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or annual refresher training for all employees. This leaves the workforce highly susceptible to social engineering attacks such as phishing, pretexting, and malware delivery, as employees may not recognize common threats or understand best practices for protecting sensitive information. Human error is a leading cause of security incidents, and lack of training exacerbates this risk. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'Does your organization do security awareness training for new employees?': 'No' and 'Does your organization do security awareness training for all employees at least once per year?': 'No'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li><li>Email systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Web Server Software (Nginx 1.18.0) - <span class="severity-Low">Low</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nginx web server running on port 443 is version 1.18.0. While this version is a stable release, it is not the latest available. Running older software versions, even stable ones, can expose the organization to known vulnerabilities that have been patched in newer releases. Without a clear patching strategy, the web server could become a target for attackers exploiting publicly known CVEs. This was identified via the network scan data showing 'nginx' version '1.18.0' on port '443'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Web server (Nginx 1.18.0)</li><li>Port 443 (HTTPS)</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to enhance endpoint security and prevent unauthorized access from compromised credentials. A comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) should be developed, communicated, and enforced to ensure all employees understand their responsibilities regarding company IT assets and data. Furthermore, mandatory security awareness training for all new hires and annual refresher training for all employees must be established to educate the workforce on common cyber threats and best security practices. Finally, a regular patching and update schedule should be implemented for all software, including the Nginx web server, to ensure all systems are running the latest secure versions and are protected against known vulnerabilities.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has implemented MFA for email and sensitive data systems, significant vulnerabilities exist in endpoint security, employee policy, and human element training. The lack of MFA for computer logins, absence of an AUP, and insufficient security awareness training represent critical gaps that could be exploited by attackers. Additionally, the use of an older web server version highlights a need for improved software update practices. Addressing these areas is crucial for enhancing the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and readiness against evolving threats.</p>
