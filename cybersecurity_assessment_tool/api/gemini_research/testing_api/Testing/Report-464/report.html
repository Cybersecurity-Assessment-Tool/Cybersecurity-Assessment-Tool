        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and computer logins, and conducting annual security awareness training for all employees. However, significant gaps exist in critical areas. There is no MFA requirement for accessing sensitive data systems, a lack of an employee acceptable use policy, and no security awareness training for new employees. Network scanning identified an open HTTP port (80) on a host, which, while not a direct vulnerability, warrants further investigation and hardening to prevent potential exposure.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Multi-Factor Authentication for Sensitive Data - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if credentials are compromised, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication. This gap leaves sensitive data vulnerable to breaches from phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without a formal AUP, there are no clear guidelines or rules for how employees should use company IT resources, including internet, email, and software. This can lead to misuse of company assets, increased exposure to cyber threats (e.g., malware downloads, unauthorized software installations), and potential legal or compliance issues due to undefined boundaries of acceptable behavior.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee workstations</li><li>Network resources</li><li>Company data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient New Employee Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. This leaves new hires vulnerable to common social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) and unaware of critical security protocols, data handling best practices, and incident reporting procedures from the start of their employment. This significantly increases the overall human risk factor and the likelihood of a security incident caused by a new employee.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Email systems</li><li>Internal network</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open HTTP Port (80) - <span class="severity-Low">Low</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An Nmap scan identified an open HTTP port (80) on a host within the network. While an open port 80 is not inherently a vulnerability, it indicates a web server or service is running without explicit encryption. If this service is not properly secured, configured for HTTPS redirection, or patched, it could expose the organization to various web-based attacks, including unencrypted data transmission, web application vulnerabilities, and server exploits. Without further context, the specific risk level is moderate, but it warrants immediate investigation.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with open port 80</li><li>Web server software</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to protect critical information from unauthorized access. Concurrently, develop and enforce a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) to establish clear guidelines for IT resource usage and mitigate misuse. Furthermore, establish mandatory security awareness training for all new employees to ensure they are equipped with essential cybersecurity knowledge from day one. Finally, thoroughly review and secure the service running on the identified open HTTP port (80), ensuring HTTPS is enforced for all web traffic and that the underlying web application and server software are fully patched and hardened.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently possesses a mixed security posture, with commendable efforts in implementing MFA for email and computer logins, and regular security awareness training for existing staff. However, critical vulnerabilities exist, particularly the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems, a lack of an acceptable use policy, and no security training for new hires. These gaps represent significant risks that could lead to data breaches, operational disruptions, and compliance failures. Addressing these identified vulnerabilities with the recommended actions is crucial for improving overall readiness and protecting the organization's assets.</p>
