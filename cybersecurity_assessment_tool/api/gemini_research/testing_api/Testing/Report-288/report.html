        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>A comprehensive network summary could not be generated as the provided network scan data was broken. However, an assessment of the organization's security posture based on available organizational data indicates several key areas. The organization currently does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access or computer logins, which represents a significant security gap. Furthermore, there is no employee acceptable use policy in place. On a positive note, the organization does require MFA for sensitive data systems and conducts security awareness training for both new and all employees annually.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee inboxes if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. A single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to an employee's communications, potentially leading to further internal network penetration or data exfiltration. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on email access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email accounts</li><li>Employee credentials</li><li>Organizational communication systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for logging into computers. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if login credentials are stolen or guessed. An attacker gaining access to a computer could potentially move laterally within the network, access sensitive data, or deploy malware. This risk was identified from the organizational data stating 'No' for MFA on computer logins.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network access points</li><li>Internal systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without a formal AUP, employees may be unaware of their responsibilities regarding the use of company IT resources, data handling, and internet usage. This can lead to increased risks such as accidental data breaches, introduction of malware, non-compliance with regulations, and misuse of company assets. The absence of this policy was identified directly from the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee behavior</li><li>IT resource usage</li><li>Data handling practices</li><li>Regulatory compliance</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and computer logins. This will significantly enhance protection against credential theft and unauthorized access. Furthermore, the organization should develop and enforce a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) to clearly define expectations for employee conduct regarding IT resources, data handling, and internet usage. Regular training on the AUP should be integrated into the existing security awareness program. While MFA is already in place for sensitive data systems, continuous monitoring and review of these controls are advised.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Based on the available organizational data, the organization demonstrates a mixed security posture. Strengths include the implementation of MFA for sensitive data systems and consistent security awareness training. However, critical vulnerabilities exist due to the absence of MFA for email and computer logins, and the lack of an acceptable use policy. These weaknesses significantly increase the organization's exposure to common cyber threats such as phishing and unauthorized access. Addressing these gaps is crucial for improving overall cybersecurity readiness and reducing the likelihood of a successful cyberattack.</p>
