        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>A comprehensive network overview could not be generated due to broken network scan data. However, based on the provided organizational data, the organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and sensitive data systems, and conducts regular security awareness training for all employees. Despite these positive measures, critical security gaps were identified, particularly concerning email access security and the absence of foundational policy documents.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. Compromised email accounts can lead to further attacks, data breaches, and business email compromise (BEC) scams, potentially resulting in financial loss and reputational damage. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA requirement for email access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee email accounts</li><li>Organizational data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines, employees may engage in activities that inadvertently introduce security risks, such as using unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling company data. This can lead to malware infections, data leakage, compliance issues, and a general lack of accountability regarding IT resource usage. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for having an employee acceptable use policy.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network resources</li><li>IT systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implements Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access. This critical step will significantly enhance protection against credential theft and unauthorized access to sensitive communications. Additionally, the organization must develop, disseminate, and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy. This policy should clearly define expectations for appropriate use of company IT resources, data handling, and internet usage, ensuring all employees understand their responsibilities in maintaining a secure environment. Regular reviews and updates of this policy, along with ongoing training, are also advised.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing MFA for computer and sensitive data access, and by conducting regular security awareness training. However, the absence of MFA for email access and a formal employee acceptable use policy represents significant vulnerabilities that could be exploited, leading to data breaches or operational disruptions. Addressing these gaps is crucial for enhancing the organization's overall security posture and readiness against evolving cyber threats.</p>
