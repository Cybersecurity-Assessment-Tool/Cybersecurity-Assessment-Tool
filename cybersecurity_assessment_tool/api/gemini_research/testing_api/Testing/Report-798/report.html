        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and sensitive data systems, and conducts regular security awareness training for all employees. However, a critical gap exists in email security, as MFA is not required for email access. Additionally, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy, which is crucial for defining appropriate conduct regarding IT resources. A network scan indicated that port 80 is closed, suggesting no immediate risk from an unencrypted web server on that specific port.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts through phishing, brute-force attacks, or compromised credentials. A successful compromise could lead to data breaches, business email compromise (BEC) scams, and further network infiltration. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). An AUP defines the proper and acceptable use of organizational IT resources, including networks, systems, and data. Without an AUP, employees may inadvertently or intentionally engage in activities that pose security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive data, leading to potential data breaches, malware infections, and compliance issues. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational IT resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication for all email accounts. This will significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials. Furthermore, developing and enforcing a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy is essential. This policy should clearly outline the acceptable use of all IT resources, including internet, email, and software, to guide employee behavior and mitigate risks associated with misuse or negligence. Regular review and updates of security policies should also be conducted.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security through MFA for critical systems and ongoing security awareness training. However, the absence of MFA for email access and a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy represents significant vulnerabilities that could expose the organization to various cyber threats, including data breaches and compliance issues. Addressing these gaps is paramount to achieving a more robust and resilient cybersecurity posture.</p>
