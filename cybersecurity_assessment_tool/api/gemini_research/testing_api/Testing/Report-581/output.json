                "Summary": "The organization's network scan revealed an open port 3389 (ms-wbt-server), indicating direct exposure of Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to the internet. From an organizational policy standpoint, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not mandated for email access or computer logins, although it is required for sensitive data systems. While an employee acceptable use policy is in place and security awareness training is provided to new employees, there is no annual security awareness training for all staff. These findings suggest a mixed security posture with critical vulnerabilities in network exposure and authentication controls, alongside some positive foundational policies.",

                        "Risk": "RDP Exposure",
                        "Overview": "Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is directly exposed to the internet via an open port 3389 (ms-wbt-server), identified during a network scan. This exposure creates a critical attack vector, allowing threat actors to attempt brute-force attacks, exploit known RDP vulnerabilities, or gain unauthorized access to internal systems. The high CVSS score of 9.0 reflects the severe potential impact, including data compromise, system control, and network lateral movement.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Public-facing IP addresses",
                            "Systems with RDP enabled"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately close port 3389 (ms-wbt-server) on all public-facing interfaces. For secure remote access, implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution and ensure RDP is only accessible through the VPN. Furthermore, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) should be implemented and enforced for all email access and computer logins to significantly enhance credential security. The organization should also establish and conduct mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees to continuously educate them on current threats and best practices, building a stronger human firewall.",
            "Conclusion": "In conclusion, the organization currently faces critical cybersecurity risks primarily due to the direct exposure of Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to the internet and significant gaps in Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) implementation for email and computer logins. While positive steps have been taken with MFA for sensitive data systems, an acceptable use policy, and new employee training, the absence of comprehensive MFA and annual security awareness training leaves the organization vulnerable to common attack vectors. Addressing these critical vulnerabilities and enhancing employee education are paramount to improving the overall security posture and readiness against cyber threats."
