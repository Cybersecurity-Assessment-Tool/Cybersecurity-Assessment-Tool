        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a mixed security posture based on the provided data. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required for accessing sensitive data systems, it is notably absent for email access and computer logins, which are critical entry points for attackers. Furthermore, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy (AUP) and does not provide security awareness training for new employees, leaving them vulnerable during their initial onboarding period. Positively, annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Email accounts are a primary target for phishing and credential stuffing attacks. Without MFA, compromised credentials can grant attackers full access to an employee's inbox, potentially leading to further internal network access, data exfiltration, or business email compromise (BEC) scams. This vulnerability was identified by the organization stating 'No' to requiring MFA for email access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee email accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Local computer logins without MFA significantly increase the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or guessed. This can lead to lateral movement within the network, data access, and malware deployment. This vulnerability was identified by the organization stating 'No' to requiring MFA for computer logins.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers/workstations</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of an Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Without a clear AUP, employees may unknowingly engage in activities that pose security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling company data. This lack of policy creates ambiguity regarding expected behavior and makes it difficult to enforce security standards. This vulnerability was identified by the organization stating 'No' to having an AUP.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees are often targets for social engineering attacks as they may be less familiar with organizational security protocols and common threats. Without initial security awareness training, they are more susceptible to phishing, malware, and other social engineering tactics, posing an immediate risk to the organization upon joining. This vulnerability was identified by the organization stating 'No' to security awareness training for new employees.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and computer logins. Furthermore, the organization should develop and enforce a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) to clearly define expected employee behavior regarding IT resource usage. Mandatory security awareness training for all new employees should be established as part of the onboarding process to mitigate initial risks. The existing annual security awareness training for all employees should be continued and regularly updated to address emerging threats.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several critical and medium-severity vulnerabilities primarily stemming from gaps in foundational security practices. The absence of MFA for email and computer logins, coupled with the lack of an AUP and initial security awareness training for new hires, creates significant exposure to common cyber threats. While MFA for sensitive data systems and annual security training are positive steps, addressing the identified weaknesses is crucial for building a robust and resilient cybersecurity defense.</p>
