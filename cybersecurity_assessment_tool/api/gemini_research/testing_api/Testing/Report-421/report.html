        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The network assessment revealed a single publicly accessible web server running Nginx version 1.18.0 on port 443 (HTTPS). While the organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, a critical gap exists in securing sensitive data systems, which currently lack MFA. Furthermore, the organization's human firewall is weakened by the absence of comprehensive security awareness training for both new and existing employees, leaving it susceptible to social engineering and other human-factor attacks.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Nginx Server - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nginx web server identified on port 443 is running version 1.18.0. This version is no longer actively maintained and is known to have several publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (e.g., CVE-2021-23017, CVE-2022-41741, CVE-2022-41742) that could lead to buffer overflows, request smuggling, or other forms of remote code execution or denial-of-service. Operating outdated software significantly increases the attack surface and risk of compromise.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Nginx 1.18.0 server</li><li>Port 443</li><li>Web application hosted on Nginx</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to systems containing sensitive data. This means that a single compromised password, obtained through phishing, malware, or other means, could grant an attacker full unauthorized access to critical information. This significantly elevates the risk of data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and severe reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User authentication mechanisms</li><li>Confidential data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks a structured program for security awareness training, neither for new employees nor on an annual basis for all staff. This deficiency leaves employees as a primary vulnerability, making them more susceptible to social engineering attacks such as phishing, malware distribution, and pretexting. A lack of understanding of common cyber threats can lead to inadvertent security breaches, data leakage, and a weakened overall security posture.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li><li>Data handling practices</li><li>Email systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's cybersecurity posture, several key recommendations are provided. Firstly, the Nginx web server should be immediately upgraded to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities and ensure ongoing security support. Concurrently, a thorough security review of the Nginx configuration should be performed. Secondly, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be implemented and enforced for all access to sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access even if primary credentials are compromised. Finally, a comprehensive security awareness training program should be established. This program should include mandatory training for all new hires and annual refresher training for all employees, covering topics such as phishing recognition, password hygiene, and secure data handling practices, to build a robust human firewall.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In conclusion, while the organization has some foundational security measures in place, such as MFA for email and computer logins, critical vulnerabilities exist. The presence of an outdated Nginx server and the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems pose immediate and high-impact risks. Furthermore, the lack of a robust security awareness training program leaves the organization vulnerable to human-factor exploits. Addressing these identified risks through software updates, MFA implementation for sensitive systems, and comprehensive employee training is paramount to achieving a mature and resilient cybersecurity readiness.</p>
