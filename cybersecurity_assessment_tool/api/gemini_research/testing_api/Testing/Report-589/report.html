        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization currently employs Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and access to sensitive data systems, which is a positive security measure. However, a significant gap exists as MFA is not required for email access, leaving a critical communication channel vulnerable. Furthermore, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy, which can lead to inconsistent security practices and increased risk from employee actions. While new employees receive security awareness training, there is no annual training for all employees, potentially leaving the workforce unprepared for evolving threats. The network scan identified an Nginx web server version 1.18.0 running on port 443, which is an outdated version and may contain known vulnerabilities.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Email accounts are a primary target for phishing and credential stuffing attacks. Without Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), compromised credentials can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive communications, data, and potentially other linked systems. This was identified from the organization's self-reported data indicating no MFA requirement for email.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) defines the proper use of organizational assets, data, and networks. Without one, employees may unknowingly engage in risky behaviors (e.g., installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, sharing sensitive data inappropriately), increasing the risk of data breaches, malware infections, and compliance violations. This was identified from the organization's self-reported data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational network</li><li>Organizational data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Regular security awareness training is crucial to keep employees informed about evolving threats (e.g., phishing, social engineering) and best practices. The absence of annual training means employees may become complacent or unaware of new risks, making them more susceptible to attacks and increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents. This was identified from the organization's self-reported data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Organizational network</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Nginx Web Server - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nginx web server version 1.18.0 was identified as running on port 443. This version is not the latest stable release and may contain known vulnerabilities that have been patched in newer versions. Running an outdated server exposes the organization to potential exploits, including remote code execution, denial-of-service, or information disclosure, which could compromise the web service or the underlying server.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Web server (nginx 1.18.0)</li><li>Port 443</li><li>Hosted web applications</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts to protect against unauthorized access. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to clearly define expected behavior and minimize risky actions. Establish and conduct mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees to ensure they are continuously informed about current threats and best practices. Furthermore, the Nginx web server should be updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities and improve overall web service security.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security by implementing MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, and providing initial security training for new hires. However, critical vulnerabilities exist due to the lack of MFA for email, the absence of an acceptable use policy, and insufficient annual security awareness training. The presence of an outdated Nginx web server also poses a significant technical risk. Addressing these areas will substantially improve the organization's readiness against common cyber threats and strengthen its overall security posture.</p>
