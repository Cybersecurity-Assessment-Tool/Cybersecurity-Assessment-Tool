        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, and maintaining an acceptable use policy. Regular security awareness training is conducted for all employees annually. However, there are notable gaps in security posture related to MFA for sensitive data systems and initial security awareness training for new hires, which could expose the organization to unnecessary risks.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if primary credentials are compromised. Without MFA, a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to sensitive data, leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and reputational damage. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational security policy questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not provide security awareness training specifically for new employees upon onboarding. While annual training is conducted for all employees, new hires are left vulnerable to common social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) and may not be aware of organizational security policies and best practices during their initial, critical period. This increases the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational security policy questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems. This critical control will significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access even if primary credentials are compromised. Additionally, a comprehensive security awareness training program should be established for all new employees as part of their onboarding process. This training should cover essential security policies, common threat vectors like phishing, and best practices to ensure new hires are immediately equipped to identify and mitigate security risks. Regular reviews of access controls and training effectiveness are also advised.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization has a mixed security readiness posture. While strong controls like MFA for email and computer logins, along with annual security awareness training, are in place, critical gaps exist. The absence of MFA for sensitive data systems and the lack of initial security awareness training for new employees represent significant vulnerabilities that could be exploited, leading to data breaches or other security incidents. Addressing these specific areas is crucial for improving overall resilience against cyber threats.</p>
