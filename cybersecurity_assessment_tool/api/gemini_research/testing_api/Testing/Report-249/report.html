        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan identified an open port 8080, exposing a service with the title 'TOP SECRET DB'. This indicates a potential direct exposure of sensitive data. While the organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, it currently does not require MFA for accessing sensitive data systems. Positive security practices include having an employee acceptable use policy and conducting regular security awareness training for all employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unsecured Sensitive Database Access - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open port 8080 was identified, exposing a service with the title 'TOP SECRET DB'. This indicates a potentially sensitive database or application is accessible from the network, possibly without adequate authentication or encryption. The presence of 'TOP SECRET DB' in the title suggests critical data could be at risk of unauthorized access or exposure. This vulnerability was identified via Nmap's HTTP title script.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li><li>Service with title 'TOP SECRET DB'</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Authentication for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or other means. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to critical data, leading to potential data breaches and compliance violations. This was identified from the organizational security policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Authentication mechanisms</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediate action is required to secure the service exposed on port 8080. This includes verifying the purpose of the 'TOP SECRET DB' service, implementing strong authentication (preferably with MFA), ensuring data encryption in transit and at rest, and restricting network access to only authorized personnel and IP addresses. Furthermore, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to significantly enhance access control and mitigate the risk of credential compromise. Regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing should be conducted to identify and address other potential weaknesses.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization demonstrates good practices in employee security awareness training and acceptable use policies, and utilizes MFA for email and computer logins, significant vulnerabilities exist regarding sensitive data access. The exposure of a 'TOP SECRET DB' service on an open port and the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems pose critical and high risks, respectively. Addressing these issues promptly is crucial to prevent unauthorized access and potential data breaches, thereby improving the overall security posture and readiness against cyber threats.</p>
