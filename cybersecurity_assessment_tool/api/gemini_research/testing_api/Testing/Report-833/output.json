            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The network scan identified an active host with an open Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) port (3389). This organization currently uses MFA for email access but not for computer logins or sensitive data systems. Furthermore, there is no employee acceptable use policy, and security awareness training is not conducted for new employees or annually for all employees.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "RDP Exposure",
                        "Overview": "Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed directly to the internet. This allows potential attackers to attempt brute-force attacks or exploit vulnerabilities in the RDP service to gain unauthorized access to the system. The impact could range from unauthorized access to data exfiltration or system compromise. This was identified by an Nmap scan showing port 3389 open.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Host with open RDP port"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "Immediate action should be taken to mitigate the exposed RDP service by closing port 3389 to the internet. For long-term secure access, implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution to restrict RDP access to authorized users only through a secure tunnel. Additionally, it is strongly recommended to implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and access to sensitive data systems to significantly enhance access security. Develop and enforce an employee acceptable use policy and establish regular security awareness training for all employees, including new hires, to foster a security-conscious culture and reduce human-factor risks.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization faces significant security risks due to an exposed RDP service, which presents a critical entry point for attackers. Compounding these technical vulnerabilities is a lack of fundamental security practices, including insufficient MFA implementation, absence of an acceptable use policy, and no regular security awareness training. These deficiencies indicate a low state of readiness against common cyber threats, making the organization highly susceptible to various attacks, including unauthorized access, data breaches, and ransomware."
