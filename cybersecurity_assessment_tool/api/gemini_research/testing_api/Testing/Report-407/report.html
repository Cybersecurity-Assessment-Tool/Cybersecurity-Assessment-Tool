        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently presents a low security posture, primarily due to critical misconfigurations and a significant lack of fundamental security controls. A network scan identified at least one active host with an open SSH port, and an internal service appears to be exposed externally. Crucially, the organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email, logging into computers, or accessing sensitive data systems. Furthermore, there is no established security awareness training for new employees, nor is there annual training for all staff. While an employee acceptable use policy is in place, the absence of these critical technical and human-centric controls leaves the organization highly vulnerable to various cyber threats.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An internal service, typically intended for local access only, has been found to be exposed externally. This critical misconfiguration allows potential attackers to directly interact with internal services, bypassing perimeter defenses and potentially leading to unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or system compromise. This was identified through network scanning revealing an exposed internal IP or service.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No MFA for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing, as a single compromised password can grant full access to an employee's email, leading to business email compromise and data leakage. This was identified via organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for logging into organizational computers. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if passwords are stolen or guessed, potentially leading to lateral movement within the network, installation of malware, and data exfiltration. This was identified via organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations</li><li>Servers</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Access to systems containing sensitive data does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). This poses a critical risk, as a compromised single factor (e.g., password) could grant an attacker direct access to confidential information, leading to severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and significant reputational damage. This was identified via organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>Cloud storage</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees, nor does it provide annual refresher training for all employees. This leaves the workforce susceptible to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting), malware, and poor security practices, significantly increasing the human element risk and making the organization more vulnerable to various cyber threats. This was identified via organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational culture</li><li>Information systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediate action is required to address the identified critical vulnerabilities. For the exposed localhost service, it is imperative to identify the service and immediately restrict external access through firewall rules and network configuration adjustments. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, prioritizing sensitive data systems, followed by email and computer logins, utilizing strong MFA methods. Establish a comprehensive security awareness training program, including mandatory onboarding training for new employees and annual refresher courses for all staff, covering topics such as phishing, password hygiene, data handling, and incident reporting. Regularly review network configurations, conduct vulnerability scans, and enforce a strong password policy across all systems to enhance overall security posture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant and critical security risks stemming from both technical misconfigurations and a fundamental lack of essential security controls. The presence of an exposed internal service, coupled with the complete absence of Multi-Factor Authentication across all critical access points (email, computer login, sensitive data systems), creates a highly exploitable environment. Furthermore, the lack of comprehensive security awareness training leaves the organization highly susceptible to human-factor attacks. While an acceptable use policy is in place, its effectiveness is severely diminished without accompanying technical controls and employee education. The current security readiness is low, necessitating immediate and substantial security enhancements to mitigate these severe risks and protect organizational assets.</p>
