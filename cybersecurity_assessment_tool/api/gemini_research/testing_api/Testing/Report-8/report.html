        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>An Nmap scan identified a host with port 80 open. The organization demonstrates strong security practices by requiring MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, and conducting regular security awareness training. However, MFA is not enforced for email access, and an employee acceptable use policy is currently absent.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2><p>No specific vulnerabilities were identified.</p><h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To further enhance the organization's security posture, it is recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access. Additionally, developing and enforcing a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy is crucial for establishing clear guidelines and expectations regarding the use of organizational assets and information.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Based on the assessment, the network infrastructure is deemed secure. While the organization has robust security measures in place for computer logins, sensitive data, and employee training, the absence of MFA for email and an acceptable use policy represents areas for improvement in overall organizational readiness. Addressing these points will further strengthen the security posture.</p>
