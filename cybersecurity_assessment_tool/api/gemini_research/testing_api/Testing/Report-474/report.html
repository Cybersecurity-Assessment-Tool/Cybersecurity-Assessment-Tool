        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a good foundational security posture with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) implemented for email and sensitive data systems. Robust security awareness training programs are in place for both new and existing employees, complemented by an employee acceptable use policy. However, a critical gap exists in the absence of MFA for computer logins. A network vulnerability assessment identified a potential unencrypted web server, indicating an area for immediate security enhancement.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unencrypted Web Server - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An unencrypted web server was identified, indicated by an open Port 80. This exposes any data transmitted over this port to potential eavesdropping and interception, compromising data confidentiality and integrity. The presence of an open, unencrypted port was identified during the network vulnerability assessment.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is recommended to immediately close Port 80 if the unencrypted web server is not essential, or implement SSL/TLS encryption for all web traffic if the service is required. Furthermore, a critical recommendation is to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins across the organization to significantly enhance endpoint security and prevent unauthorized access, aligning with the existing MFA policies for email and sensitive data systems.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization has established a strong foundation in security awareness and policy enforcement, with MFA in place for critical systems like email and sensitive data. However, the absence of MFA for computer logins represents a significant vulnerability. The presence of an unencrypted web server further highlights areas requiring immediate attention to prevent data exposure. Addressing these specific vulnerabilities will significantly enhance the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness.</p>
