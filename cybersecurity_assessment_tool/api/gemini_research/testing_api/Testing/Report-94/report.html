        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization has implemented multi-factor authentication (MFA) for email access, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, which is a strong security measure. An employee acceptable use policy is also in place. However, a significant gap exists in the area of security awareness training, as the organization does not conduct training for new employees nor does it provide annual training for all employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or annually for all employees. This critical oversight significantly increases the risk of successful social engineering attacks, phishing attempts, and other human-factor exploits. Employees who are not regularly educated on cybersecurity best practices, threat identification, and incident reporting are more susceptible to falling victim to cyberattacks, which can lead to data breaches, malware infections, and unauthorized access to systems. This vulnerability was identified through the organization's self-reported data indicating no security awareness training programs.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network systems</li><li>Email infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>It is strongly recommended that the organization implement a comprehensive and mandatory security awareness training program. This program should include initial training for all new hires, covering topics such as phishing recognition, password hygiene, data handling policies, and incident reporting procedures. Furthermore, annual refresher training should be conducted for all employees, incorporating current threat landscapes, simulated phishing exercises, and updates to organizational security policies. Regular training will significantly enhance the 'human firewall' and reduce the likelihood of successful cyberattacks exploiting human vulnerabilities.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has established a solid baseline with MFA implementation across critical access points and an acceptable use policy, the absence of a robust security awareness training program represents a significant and high-severity vulnerability. This gap leaves the organization susceptible to human-centric cyberattacks. Addressing this lack of training is paramount to improving the overall security posture and readiness against evolving cyber threats.</p>
