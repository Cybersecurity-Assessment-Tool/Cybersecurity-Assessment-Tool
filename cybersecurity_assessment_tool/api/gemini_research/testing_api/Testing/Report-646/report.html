        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Based on the provided organizational data, specific network details were not available for assessment. However, the organization demonstrates positive security practices by having an employee acceptable use policy and conducting security awareness training for both new and existing employees annually. Despite these strengths, critical gaps exist in the implementation of multi-factor authentication (MFA) for key access points.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee inboxes if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. A successful breach could lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and further lateral movement within the network. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on email access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee email accounts</li><li>Email server/service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive information. If an attacker gains access to credentials for these systems, they can directly access or exfiltrate sensitive data without an additional layer of security. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on sensitive data systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases containing sensitive information</li><li>File shares with sensitive data</li><li>Applications handling sensitive information</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>It is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and all sensitive data systems. For email, this will significantly reduce the risk of account compromise and subsequent phishing or BEC attacks. For sensitive data systems, MFA will provide a crucial additional layer of security, protecting critical information from unauthorized access even if primary credentials are stolen. Furthermore, while not explicitly identified as a vulnerability, regularly reviewing and updating the acceptable use policy and security awareness training content to reflect current threat landscapes is advisable.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization exhibits a foundational commitment to security through its employee acceptable use policy and consistent security awareness training. However, a critical gap in its security posture is the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for both email access and sensitive data systems. This leaves the organization highly vulnerable to credential-based attacks and unauthorized data access. Addressing these MFA deficiencies is paramount to enhancing overall readiness and protecting against significant cybersecurity threats.</p>
