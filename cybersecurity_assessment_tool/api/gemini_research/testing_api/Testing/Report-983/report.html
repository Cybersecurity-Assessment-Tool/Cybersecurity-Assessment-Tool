        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and computer logins, and by providing security awareness training for new employees. However, significant security gaps were identified. MFA is not required for accessing sensitive data systems, which poses a critical risk for data breaches. Furthermore, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees, leaving the workforce susceptible to social engineering and policy violations. A network scan revealed an open SSH port (22), which, while common, requires stringent security measures. A critical vulnerability, 'Localhost Exposed', was also identified, indicating a severe exposure within the network.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A critical vulnerability was identified where internal services or an internal IP address appears to be exposed, potentially allowing unauthorized external access or information disclosure. Given its critical severity, this exposure could lead to severe impact, including full system compromise, data exfiltration, or unauthorized control over internal resources. The vulnerability was identified through a security assessment, indicating a misconfiguration or lack of proper network segmentation.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information should primary credentials be compromised through phishing, malware, or brute-force attacks. The absence of this crucial security layer makes sensitive data highly vulnerable.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive Data Systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks an employee acceptable use policy (AUP). Without a clear AUP, employees may inadvertently or intentionally engage in activities that pose security risks, such as improper use of company resources, unauthorized software installations, or unsafe browsing habits. This absence creates ambiguity regarding expected behavior and makes it difficult to enforce security best practices.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All Employees</li><li>Company Resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This oversight means that employees may not be updated on the latest threats, evolving attack techniques, or changes in company security policies. Over time, security knowledge degrades, increasing susceptibility to phishing, social engineering, and other cyber threats.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All Employees</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port (22) - <span class="severity-Low">Low</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A network scan identified an open SSH (Secure Shell) port (22). While SSH is a legitimate service for remote access, an open port without proper hardening and monitoring can be a target for brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or exploitation of SSH vulnerabilities. If not securely configured, it could provide an entry point for unauthorized access to the network.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Network Perimeter</li><li>SSH Service</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, immediate action is required to address the identified critical 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability by reconfiguring network access controls and ensuring internal services are not inadvertently exposed. Furthermore, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be implemented for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access. The organization should develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to clearly define expected security behaviors and mitigate internal risks. Regular, at least annual, security awareness training for all employees is crucial to keep the workforce informed about evolving threats and best practices. Finally, the open SSH port (22) should be rigorously secured by implementing strong authentication methods (e.g., key-based authentication), disabling root login, restricting access to trusted IP addresses, and regularly patching the SSH server software.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently possesses a mixed security posture, with some foundational controls in place such as MFA for email and computer logins, and initial security training for new hires. However, critical vulnerabilities and significant gaps in security policy and ongoing training expose the organization to substantial risks. The 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability, coupled with the lack of MFA for sensitive data, absence of an acceptable use policy, and insufficient annual security training, indicates a pressing need for comprehensive security enhancements. Addressing these identified risks and implementing the recommended mitigation strategies is paramount to improving the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and protecting its valuable assets from potential cyber threats.</p>
