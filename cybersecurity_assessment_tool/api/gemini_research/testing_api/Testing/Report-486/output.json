            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and access to sensitive data systems, which is a strong security practice. However, there are gaps in foundational security policies and training. Specifically, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct security awareness training for new employees, although annual training is provided for all staff. Network scans indicate a potential vulnerability related to an unencrypted web server.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Unencrypted Web Server",
                        "Overview": "This risk indicates that a web server is accessible via Port 80 without encryption. This means that any data transmitted between users and this server is sent in plain text, making it vulnerable to interception and eavesdropping by malicious actors. The impact could include exposure of sensitive information, credentials, or session data. This was identified through network scanning which showed Port 80 as open.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Port 80"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is recommended to immediately address the unencrypted web server by either closing Port 80 if it's not intended for public access, or, for long-term security, implementing SSL/TLS encryption to secure all web traffic. Furthermore, the organization should develop and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to clearly define expected behavior and security responsibilities. It is also crucial to introduce security awareness training for all new employees during their onboarding process to ensure they are equipped with essential security knowledge from day one, complementing the existing annual training.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization demonstrates a good baseline with MFA implementation across critical access points. However, the absence of an acceptable use policy and initial security awareness training for new hires, coupled with the presence of an unencrypted web server, indicates areas requiring immediate attention to enhance overall security posture and readiness against common cyber threats. Addressing these gaps will significantly improve the organization's resilience."
