        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently presents several critical security vulnerabilities. An Nmap scan identified an FTP server running vsftpd 2.3.4 on port 21, which allows anonymous login, posing a significant risk of unauthorized access and data exposure. Furthermore, a review of organizational policies revealed a lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for both email access and computer logins, which substantially increases the risk of credential compromise. Additionally, a significant portion of workstations are still operating on Windows 7, an end-of-life operating system, leaving them exposed to known and unpatched vulnerabilities. On a positive note, the organization does implement MFA for sensitive data systems, has an employee acceptable use policy, and conducts security awareness training for both new and existing employees annually, indicating a foundational understanding of security best practices in some areas.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Anonymous FTP Login Allowed - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The FTP server (vsftpd 2.3.4) on port 21 allows anonymous login. This configuration can lead to unauthorized access to files, potential data leakage, or the upload of malicious content, depending on the server's specific permissions. This vulnerability was identified via an Nmap scan using the 'ftp-anon' script.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>ftp://[host_ip]:21</li><li>vsftpd 2.3.4</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email and Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email or logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if user credentials are stolen or compromised, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication. This policy gap was identified through organizational data review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email access systems</li><li>Computer login systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Windows Policy (Windows 7) - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Computers are running Windows 7. This operating system has reached its end-of-life, meaning it no longer receives security updates or patches from Microsoft. This leaves systems vulnerable to known exploits and new threats, increasing the risk of malware infection, data breaches, and system compromise. This vulnerability was identified through an assessment of current risks.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately disable anonymous login on the FTP server and ensure that all FTP access requires strong, authenticated credentials. Furthermore, the organization must prioritize the implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and computer login systems to significantly enhance protection against credential theft. All workstations running Windows 7 should be upgraded to a currently supported operating system, such as Windows 10 or 11, to ensure they receive critical security updates. While the existing security awareness training and acceptable use policy are positive, these should be reinforced with specific training modules addressing the dangers of outdated software and the importance of MFA. Regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing should also be conducted to identify and address new threats proactively.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to an insecure FTP service, a lack of MFA for critical access points, and the continued use of end-of-life operating systems. While there are commendable efforts in security awareness training and policy implementation for sensitive data, these are overshadowed by fundamental vulnerabilities that could lead to data breaches or system compromise. Addressing these high-severity risks promptly is crucial to improving the organization's overall security posture and readiness against cyber threats.</p>
