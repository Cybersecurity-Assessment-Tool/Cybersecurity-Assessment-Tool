        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security practices by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and conducting annual security awareness training for all employees. An acceptable use policy is also in place. However, there are significant gaps in MFA implementation for computer logins and sensitive data systems, and a lack of security awareness training for new employees, which collectively expose the organization to elevated risks.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for employees to log into their computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised, as a single factor (password) is insufficient to protect against modern attack vectors. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk, as compromised credentials could grant attackers direct access to confidential information, leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and severe reputational damage. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>Cloud storage solutions</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees upon their onboarding. This leaves new hires vulnerable to social engineering attacks, phishing, and other common threats from day one, as they may not be aware of the organization's specific security policies, best practices, or common attack indicators. This was identified through the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and access to sensitive data systems. This critical step will significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access even if primary credentials are compromised. Furthermore, a mandatory security awareness training program should be established for all new employees as part of their onboarding process to ensure they are equipped with the necessary knowledge to identify and report potential threats from the outset. Regular reviews of security policies and training content should also be conducted to adapt to evolving threat landscapes.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has some foundational security controls in place, such as MFA for email and annual security awareness training, critical vulnerabilities exist due to the absence of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, and a lack of security awareness training for new employees. Addressing these gaps is paramount to improving the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and mitigating the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.</p>
