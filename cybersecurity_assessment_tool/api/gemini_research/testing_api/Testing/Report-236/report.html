        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network assessment revealed several critical areas requiring immediate attention to enhance its security posture. Key findings include significant gaps in multi-factor authentication implementation for email and computer logins, a complete absence of an employee acceptable use policy, and insufficient recurring security awareness training for all staff. Additionally, a network scan identified an open port 80, which could pose a risk if not properly secured. While the organization does require MFA for sensitive data systems and provides initial security training for new employees, these positive aspects are overshadowed by the broader systemic vulnerabilities.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly elevates the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive communications and data if user credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. An attacker gaining access to an email account can impersonate users, initiate fraudulent transactions, or pivot to other systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email systems</li><li>User email accounts</li><li>Corporate data accessed via email</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not enforced for logging into organizational computers. This vulnerability allows an attacker who obtains a user's username and password to gain direct access to internal workstations and potentially the network. This increases the risk of malware propagation, data theft, and lateral movement within the network, as a single compromised credential can lead to a significant breach.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations</li><li>Servers</li><li>User accounts</li><li>Internal network</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). Without a clear AUP, employees may be unaware of the proper and prohibited use of company IT resources, including internet access, software installation, and data handling. This absence can lead to increased risks of malware infections, data leakage, legal liabilities, and inefficient use of resources due to unmanaged employee behavior.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>IT systems</li><li>Data assets</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Recurring Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive initial security awareness training, the organization does not conduct regular, at least annual, security awareness training for all employees. This oversight means that employees may not be kept informed about evolving cyber threats (e.g., new phishing techniques, social engineering tactics), updated company policies, or best practices. Over time, this can lead to a degradation of security knowledge and an increased susceptibility to human-factor attacks.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open Port 80 (HTTP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A network scan identified an open port 80 (HTTP) on the perimeter. While HTTP is a standard protocol for web traffic, its presence without proper security configurations (e.g., mandatory redirection to HTTPS, robust web server hardening, or closure if not needed) can expose the organization to risks. These include unencrypted data transmission, potential for server-side vulnerabilities (e.g., outdated web server software, misconfigurations), and information disclosure.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Network perimeter</li><li>Web server (if active)</li><li>Data in transit</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly improve the organization's cybersecurity posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all email systems and for all computer logins to prevent unauthorized access from compromised credentials. Furthermore, the organization must develop and enforce a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) to clearly define acceptable behavior and responsibilities regarding IT resource usage. Regular, at least annual, security awareness training for all employees should be established to ensure ongoing education on evolving threats and best practices. Finally, the open port 80 identified during the scan should be thoroughly reviewed; if a web service is intended, it must be secured with HTTPS and robust hardening, otherwise, it should be closed to minimize the attack surface.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The current cybersecurity assessment indicates that the organization faces several significant vulnerabilities, primarily stemming from a lack of foundational security controls such as widespread Multi-Factor Authentication, a formal Acceptable Use Policy, and consistent security awareness training. While some positive security practices are in place, the identified gaps leave the organization susceptible to various cyber threats, including unauthorized access, data breaches, and social engineering attacks. Addressing these critical areas is paramount to enhancing the organization's overall security readiness and resilience against modern cyber threats.</p>
