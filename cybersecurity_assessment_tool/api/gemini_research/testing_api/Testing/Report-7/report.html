        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization currently has some foundational security measures in place, including multi-factor authentication (MFA) for email access and annual security awareness training for all employees. However, significant vulnerabilities were identified concerning the lack of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems. Additionally, the absence of an employee acceptable use policy and security awareness training for new employees represents critical gaps in the organization's security posture. A network scan also revealed an open SSH port, which, if not properly secured, could serve as an entry point for attackers.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require multi-factor authentication (MFA) for employees to log into their computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or malware. Without a second factor, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's workstation and potentially the internal network, leading to data exfiltration or further lateral movement within the environment.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers</li><li>Internal network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-factor authentication is not enforced for accessing sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk, as unauthorized access to these systems could lead to severe consequences such as data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, significant financial loss, and severe reputational damage. If an attacker gains access to credentials for these systems, they can directly access, modify, or exfiltrate sensitive information without an additional layer of security.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases containing sensitive information</li><li>File shares with confidential data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. This absence means there are no clear, documented guidelines for employees regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, internet access, email, and data handling. This can lead to inconsistent security practices, increased risk of data leakage, malware infections from inappropriate web browsing, and potential legal liabilities due to employee misconduct or negligence.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Network infrastructure</li><li>Data handling procedures</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive mandatory security awareness training upon joining the organization. This leaves them vulnerable to common cyber threats such as social engineering attacks, phishing attempts, and malware from their first day. Untrained new hires may inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities, fall victim to scams, or mishandle sensitive information, potentially compromising the organization's security posture before they understand established security protocols.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security culture</li><li>Phishing defense mechanisms</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port (Port 22) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH (Secure Shell) port (22) was detected on a host within the network. While SSH is a legitimate and secure protocol for remote access, an open port represents an attack surface. If not properly secured with strong authentication (e.g., key-based authentication, MFA) and restricted access (e.g., IP whitelisting), it can be vulnerable to brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or exploitation of SSH daemon vulnerabilities, potentially leading to unauthorized remote access and system compromise.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with open port 22</li><li>Remote access services</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and access to sensitive data systems. A comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) should be developed, communicated, and enforced across the organization. Mandatory security awareness training must be introduced for all new employees as part of their onboarding process, complementing the existing annual training for all staff. Furthermore, a thorough review and hardening of the SSH configuration on the identified host with port 22 open is crucial, ensuring strong authentication methods (e.g., key-based), IP whitelisting, and regular patching of the SSH daemon. Regular security audits and policy reviews should also be conducted to maintain an adaptive and robust security framework.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of cybersecurity by implementing MFA for email and conducting annual security awareness training. However, critical vulnerabilities exist in the areas of multi-factor authentication for core systems (computer logins and sensitive data access), the absence of a formal acceptable use policy, and a lack of security awareness training for new employees. These gaps significantly increase the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and operational disruption. Addressing these identified risks with the recommended mitigation strategies is paramount to fortify the organization's defenses and achieve a more mature and resilient security posture.</p>
