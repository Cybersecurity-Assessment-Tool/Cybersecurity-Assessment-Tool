        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems. However, critical gaps exist in securing computer logins, employee policy enforcement, and initial security awareness training. Network scans indicate an open SSH port (22), which, if not properly secured, presents a significant attack surface. The absence of an acceptable use policy and specific security training for new hires introduces considerable human-factor risks, despite annual training for all employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to internal systems if employee credentials are compromised through phishing, malware, or other means. Without a second factor, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access, enabling lateral movement and potential data exfiltration. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers</li><li>Internal network access points</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy (AUP). Without a formal AUP, employees may not be fully aware of their responsibilities regarding the use of company IT assets, data handling, and internet usage. This can lead to increased risks of data leakage, misuse of company resources, introduction of malware, and non-compliance with security best practices. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company data</li><li>IT systems</li><li>Network resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Onboarding Security Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees upon their onboarding. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering and phishing attacks due to their unfamiliarity with company policies and security protocols. Delaying security training until the annual cycle leaves a critical window during which new employees are more susceptible to falling victim to attacks, potentially compromising company systems and data. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Email systems</li><li>Internal network</li><li>Company data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed SSH Service - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A network scan identified an open SSH (port 22) service. If this service is not adequately secured with strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., key-based authentication, MFA) and strict access controls (e.g., IP whitelisting), it can be a target for brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or exploitation of SSH vulnerabilities. Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized remote access to the underlying server, potentially compromising sensitive data or enabling further network penetration. This vulnerability was identified through network scan data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Server with open port 22</li><li>Network perimeter</li><li>SSH daemon configuration</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to prevent unauthorized access from compromised credentials. Develop and enforce a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) to clearly define employee responsibilities regarding IT asset and data usage. Introduce mandatory security awareness training for all new employees as part of their onboarding process to immediately educate them on security best practices and common threats. For the exposed SSH service, ensure it is secured with strong, key-based authentication, disable password authentication, implement strict access controls (e.g., firewall rules to limit source IPs), and regularly patch the SSH server software.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization has made progress in securing email and sensitive data systems with MFA, indicating a positive security mindset. However, significant vulnerabilities remain, particularly concerning computer login security, employee policy, and initial security awareness training. The presence of an open SSH port also requires immediate attention. Addressing these critical areas will substantially enhance the organization's overall security posture, reduce the attack surface, and improve readiness against common cyber threats.</p>
