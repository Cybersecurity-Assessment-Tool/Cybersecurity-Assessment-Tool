        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an active host with an open port 80, indicating a potential web service running without encryption. Furthermore, the organizational data indicates significant security gaps, including a complete lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. There is also an absence of an employee acceptable use policy and security awareness training for new employees, although annual training is conducted for existing staff. These factors collectively point to a low security readiness posture with several critical vulnerabilities.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email, logging into computers, or accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access and account compromise, as a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to critical organizational resources. The impact of such a breach could range from data exfiltration to complete system takeover. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational security policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email systems</li><li>User login systems (computers)</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open Port 80 (HTTP) without Encryption - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A host on the network was found to have port 80 (HTTP) open. This indicates that a web service is likely running without encryption. Data transmitted over unencrypted HTTP is vulnerable to eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attacks, and potential data exposure. If sensitive information is exchanged over this port, it could be intercepted by malicious actors. This vulnerability was identified during the network scan.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with port 80 open</li><li>Web applications/services running on port 80</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without a clear AUP, employees may be unaware of the proper and secure use of company IT resources, data handling procedures, and internet usage guidelines. This increases the risk of misuse of company assets, inadvertent data breaches, and non-compliance with security best practices, potentially leading to legal and reputational damage. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Organizational data assets</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees are not provided with security awareness training upon joining the organization. This leaves new hires particularly susceptible to social engineering attacks, phishing attempts, and other human-centric vulnerabilities from the outset. Without foundational security knowledge, new employees pose an immediate and elevated risk to the organization's security posture. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational training program review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical systems, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data access. All web services operating on port 80 should either be secured with HTTPS encryption and redirection or the port should be closed if the service is not essential. The organization must develop and enforce a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy to guide employee behavior regarding IT resource usage. Furthermore, mandatory security awareness training should be integrated into the onboarding process for all new employees, complementing the existing annual training for all staff.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The current assessment reveals that the organization faces several critical security vulnerabilities, primarily stemming from a lack of robust access controls (MFA), unencrypted web services, and significant gaps in security policies and initial employee training. While annual security awareness training is a positive step, the absence of MFA, an AUP, and new employee training creates substantial exposure to unauthorized access, data breaches, and human error. Addressing these fundamental issues is paramount to improving the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and protecting its assets.</p>
