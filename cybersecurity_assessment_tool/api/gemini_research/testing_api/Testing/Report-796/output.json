            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to identity and access management by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. This significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials. However, the network scan did not identify any open ports, indicating a well-secured external perimeter. Despite these technical strengths, there are critical gaps in human-factor security, specifically regarding employee policies and security awareness training.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Absence of Acceptable Use Policy",
                        "Overview": "The organization currently lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without a clear policy, employees may not fully understand their responsibilities regarding the proper and secure use of company IT resources, data, and internet access. This can lead to misuse of company assets, increased risk of data breaches, compliance violations, and potential legal liabilities. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating no acceptable use policy is in place.",

                        "Risk": "Inadequate New Employee Security Training",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often a high-risk group as they are unfamiliar with the organization's specific security protocols, common threats, and best practices. This lack of initial training significantly increases the likelihood of new employees falling victim to phishing, social engineering attacks, or inadvertently causing security incidents, thereby exposing the organization to various cyber threats. This was identified from the organizational data stating no security awareness training for new employees.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                    {
                        "Risk": "Absence of Regular Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. Without regular, ongoing training, employees may forget critical security best practices, become complacent, or fail to recognize evolving cyber threats such as new phishing techniques, ransomware variants, or social engineering tactics. This significantly elevates the organization's overall susceptibility to human-factor attacks, which remain a primary vector for successful cyber intrusions. This was identified from the organizational data stating no annual security awareness training.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "Organizational data",
                            "Network security",
                            "Incident response capabilities"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately develop and implement a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). This policy should clearly define expectations for the secure and appropriate use of all company IT assets and data. Furthermore, a robust security awareness training program must be established. This program should include mandatory training for all new employees during their onboarding process, covering essential security principles, threat recognition, and organizational policies. Additionally, annual refresher training should be implemented for all employees to ensure continuous education on evolving threats and to reinforce best practices. These measures will significantly strengthen the human element of the organization's security posture, complementing the existing technical controls.",
            "Conclusion": "While the organization has implemented strong technical controls, particularly Multi-Factor Authentication across critical systems and a well-secured external network perimeter with no open ports, its overall cybersecurity readiness is significantly hampered by a lack of foundational human-factor security measures. The absence of an Acceptable Use Policy and comprehensive, regular security awareness training for both new and existing employees introduces substantial risks. Addressing these policy and training gaps is paramount to building a resilient security posture and protecting against the most common and impactful cyber threats."
