        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization has established an acceptable use policy and conducts regular security awareness training for all employees, including new hires, at least once per year. This indicates a foundational commitment to employee education and policy enforcement. However, a significant security gap exists in the implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), which is currently only required for accessing sensitive data systems. MFA is not mandated for email access or computer logins, leaving these critical access points vulnerable to credential-based attacks.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. A compromised email account can serve as a gateway for further attacks, including business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and lateral movement within the network. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee email accounts</li><li>Email servers</li><li>Cloud email services</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for employees to log into their computers. This exposes workstations and potentially the internal network to unauthorized access if login credentials are stolen, guessed, or brute-forced. An attacker gaining access to a computer without MFA can potentially access internal resources, sensitive data, and deploy malware, leading to significant operational disruption and data breaches. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Domain controllers</li><li>Network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points. Specifically, MFA should be mandated for all email access to protect against credential theft and phishing. Additionally, MFA must be enforced for all computer logins to secure endpoints and prevent unauthorized network access. Regular reviews of security policies and continued, enhanced security awareness training, focusing on the importance of MFA and identifying social engineering tactics, will further strengthen defenses. While the current security awareness training and acceptable use policy are positive steps, their effectiveness will be greatly amplified by robust technical controls like MFA.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a commendable commitment to cybersecurity through its established acceptable use policy and consistent security awareness training. However, a critical vulnerability exists due to the limited implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). The absence of MFA for email access and computer logins presents a significant risk, making the organization susceptible to unauthorized access and potential data breaches. While MFA is correctly applied to sensitive data systems, extending this crucial control to other key access points is paramount to achieving a robust security posture and enhancing overall readiness against prevalent cyber threats.</p>
