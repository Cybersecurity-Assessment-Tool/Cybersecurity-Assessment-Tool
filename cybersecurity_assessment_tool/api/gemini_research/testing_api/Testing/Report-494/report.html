        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network includes an FTP server running vsftpd 2.3.4. The current security posture reveals significant gaps in identity and access management, particularly concerning Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization lacks an acceptable use policy and does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. Several workstations are running outdated operating systems (Windows 7).</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Anonymous FTP Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The FTP server (vsftpd 2.3.4) on port 21 allows anonymous login. This can lead to unauthorized access to files, data leakage, or even arbitrary file uploads if not properly configured, potentially compromising data confidentiality and integrity.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>FTP Server (vsftpd 2.3.4)</li><li>Port 21</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing or brute-force attacks, as a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to an employee's email.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This makes workstations vulnerable to unauthorized access if passwords are stolen or guessed, potentially leading to lateral movement within the network and access to sensitive data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This is a critical vulnerability as it means that a compromised password could directly lead to unauthorized access to highly sensitive information, resulting in severe data breaches.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This absence means there are no clear guidelines for employees on the proper and secure use of company IT resources, increasing the risk of misuse, accidental data breaches, and non-compliance with security best practices.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employees</li><li>IT resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This leaves the workforce susceptible to evolving threats like advanced phishing techniques, social engineering, and malware, as their knowledge may become outdated.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employees</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Windows Policy - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Computers are running Windows 7. This operating system is End-of-Life and no longer receives security updates, making workstations highly vulnerable to known exploits and malware.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediately disable anonymous FTP access on the vsftpd server and ensure proper authentication and authorization controls are in place. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts, computer logins, and access to sensitive data systems to significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials. Develop and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to provide clear guidelines for the secure and appropriate use of IT resources. Establish a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees to keep them informed about current threats and best security practices. Upgrade all workstations running Windows 7 to a currently supported operating system like Windows 10 or 11 to address known vulnerabilities and ensure ongoing security updates. Consider a hardware refresh if existing machines cannot support newer OS versions.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several critical and high-severity vulnerabilities, primarily stemming from a lack of robust access controls (MFA) and outdated systems/policies. The presence of an anonymous FTP server and workstations running Windows 7, combined with insufficient security policies and training, creates a significant attack surface. Addressing these issues promptly through the recommended actions is crucial to enhance the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and reduce the risk of data breaches and system compromises.</p>
