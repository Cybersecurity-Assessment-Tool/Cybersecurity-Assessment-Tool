                "Summary": "The organization's network includes an FTP server running vsftpd 2.3.4. The current security posture reveals significant gaps in identity and access management, particularly concerning Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization lacks an acceptable use policy and does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. Several workstations are running outdated operating systems (Windows 7).",

                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing or brute-force attacks, as a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to an employee's email.",

                        "Overview": "While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This leaves the workforce susceptible to evolving threats like advanced phishing techniques, social engineering, and malware, as their knowledge may become outdated.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Outdated Windows Policy",
                        "Overview": "Computers are running Windows 7. This operating system is End-of-Life and no longer receives security updates, making workstations highly vulnerable to known exploits and malware.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "Immediately disable anonymous FTP access on the vsftpd server and ensure proper authentication and authorization controls are in place. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts, computer logins, and access to sensitive data systems to significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials. Develop and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to provide clear guidelines for the secure and appropriate use of IT resources. Establish a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees to keep them informed about current threats and best security practices. Upgrade all workstations running Windows 7 to a currently supported operating system like Windows 10 or 11 to address known vulnerabilities and ensure ongoing security updates. Consider a hardware refresh if existing machines cannot support newer OS versions.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces several critical and high-severity vulnerabilities, primarily stemming from a lack of robust access controls (MFA) and outdated systems/policies. The presence of an anonymous FTP server and workstations running Windows 7, combined with insufficient security policies and training, creates a significant attack surface. Addressing these issues promptly through the recommended actions is crucial to enhance the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and reduce the risk of data breaches and system compromises."
