        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open SSH port (22), indicating a potential entry point that requires robust security measures. While the organization has an acceptable use policy and provides security awareness training for new employees, there are significant gaps in its security posture. Specifically, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for computer logins or access to sensitive data systems, and annual security awareness training for all employees is not conducted. These deficiencies expose the organization to elevated risks of unauthorized access and human-error-induced breaches.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unsecured SSH Access - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH port (22) was detected on the network. While SSH is a secure protocol, an open port presents a potential attack surface if not properly secured with strong authentication methods (e.g., key-based authentication, MFA) and restricted access controls (e.g., IP whitelisting). Unauthorized access could lead to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further network penetration.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Network perimeter</li><li>Any host with port 22 open</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Weak Authentication for Endpoints - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen, phished, or brute-forced. A single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to an employee's workstation and potentially the internal network, leading to data breaches or system compromise.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee workstations</li><li>Internal network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Weak Authentication for Critical Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk to data confidentiality and integrity. If an attacker gains access to credentials for these systems, they can directly access, modify, or exfiltrate sensitive information without an additional layer of security, leading to severe data breaches and regulatory non-compliance.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>Cloud storage</li><li>Critical applications</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Employee Security Awareness - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. This leaves employees vulnerable to social engineering attacks, phishing, and other human-centric threats. A lack of regular training means employees may not be up-to-date on the latest threats and best practices, increasing the likelihood of successful attacks that exploit human error and compromise organizational security.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li><li>Susceptibility to social engineering</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, including computer logins and sensitive data systems, as a top priority. For the open SSH port, ensure it is secured with strong, key-based authentication, disable password authentication, and restrict access to only necessary IP addresses. Furthermore, establish a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees to continuously educate them on current threats and best practices, reinforcing a strong security culture. Regularly review and update the acceptable use policy to reflect evolving threats and technologies.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant vulnerabilities primarily due to the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for critical access points and a lack of consistent, organization-wide security awareness training. While some foundational policies are in place, the current readiness level is suboptimal, leaving the organization exposed to high-impact cyber threats. Addressing these core issues is crucial for enhancing the overall security posture and protecting sensitive assets.</p>
