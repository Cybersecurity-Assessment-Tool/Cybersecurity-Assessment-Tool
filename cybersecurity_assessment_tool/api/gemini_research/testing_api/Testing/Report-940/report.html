        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization currently lacks critical multi-factor authentication (MFA) controls across key access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. This significantly elevates the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. Furthermore, the absence of an employee acceptable use policy (AUP) creates a gap in defining expected employee behavior regarding IT resource usage, potentially leading to misuse and increased security risks. While the organization does conduct regular security awareness training for all employees, the lack of foundational security controls like MFA and clear policies undermines the effectiveness of this training. The network scan data provided was minimal, indicating no immediately obvious external vulnerabilities, but this does not mitigate the internal organizational risks identified.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of successful phishing attacks, credential stuffing, and unauthorized access to employee inboxes, potentially leading to business email compromise, data exfiltration, and further internal network penetration. This was identified through organizational data indicating "No" for MFA on email.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>All employee email accounts</li><li>Sensitive communications</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for employees to log into their computers. This makes workstations vulnerable to unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or guessed, potentially allowing attackers to gain a foothold within the internal network, access local files, and move laterally. This was identified through organizational data indicating "No" for MFA on computer login.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee workstations</li><li>Internal network access</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Access to sensitive data systems does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). This poses a critical risk, as a compromise of a single set of credentials could grant an attacker direct access to highly confidential or proprietary information, leading to severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and significant reputational and financial damage. This was identified through organizational data indicating "No" for MFA on sensitive data systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All sensitive data systems (e.g., CRM, ERP, HR systems, databases)</li><li>Confidential data</li><li>Intellectual property</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks an employee acceptable use policy (AUP). Without a formal AUP, there are no clear guidelines for employees regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, internet access, email, and data handling. This can lead to increased risks such as malware infections from unauthorized software installations, data leakage through unapproved cloud services, legal liabilities, and general misuse of company assets, making it harder to enforce security best practices. This was identified through organizational data indicating "No" for an acceptable use policy.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT infrastructure</li><li>Data assets</li><li>Legal and compliance posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>It is strongly recommended that the organization prioritize the immediate implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points. This includes email systems, computer logins, and especially sensitive data systems, to significantly enhance protection against credential-based attacks. Concurrently, a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) should be developed, communicated, and enforced to establish clear guidelines for responsible IT resource usage and data handling. The existing security awareness training program should be leveraged to educate employees on these new policies and the importance of MFA, reinforcing a strong security culture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant security vulnerabilities primarily due to the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, alongside the lack of a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy. While security awareness training is in place, these foundational control gaps leave the organization highly susceptible to unauthorized access, data breaches, and misuse of resources. Addressing these critical areas with robust MFA implementation and policy development is paramount to improving the overall security posture and readiness against modern cyber threats.</p>
