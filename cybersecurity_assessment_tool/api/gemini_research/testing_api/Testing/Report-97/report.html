        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes an Nginx web server (version 1.18.0) on port 443, indicating a public-facing web service secured with HTTPS. Internally, the organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and computer logins, which is a positive security measure. However, critical gaps exist in the security posture, particularly concerning access to sensitive data systems, employee conduct policies, and ongoing security awareness training. These policy and process-related deficiencies introduce significant risks that could undermine the technical controls in place.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or other means. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to sensitive data, leading to data breaches, compliance violations, and reputational damage. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This means there are no formal guidelines or rules for how employees should use company IT resources, including networks, devices, and data. This absence can lead to misuse of company assets, increased exposure to malware (e.g., through unrestricted internet usage), data breaches due to inappropriate data handling, and potential legal liabilities stemming from employee actions. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Network infrastructure</li><li>Organizational data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This results in outdated knowledge regarding evolving threats, new company policies, and best practices. Employees who are not regularly trained are more susceptible to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, vishing), malware, and can inadvertently cause data breaches or system compromises due to a lack of awareness. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network security</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised. Concurrently, a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) must be developed, communicated, and enforced to establish clear guidelines for IT resource usage and data handling, thereby reducing the risk of misuse and accidental breaches. Furthermore, the security awareness training program should be expanded to include mandatory annual training for all employees, ensuring that staff remain informed about the latest threats and best security practices. Regular vulnerability scanning and patching of the Nginx web server (version 1.18.0) and other network assets should also be conducted to address any potential software vulnerabilities.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational level of security readiness with MFA for email and computer logins, and initial security training for new hires. However, significant vulnerabilities exist in the areas of sensitive data access controls, formal employee conduct policies, and ongoing security education. The absence of MFA for sensitive data systems, a formal Acceptable Use Policy, and annual security awareness training for all employees represents critical gaps that could be exploited. Addressing these policy and process-related deficiencies is paramount to enhancing the overall cybersecurity posture and protecting organizational assets from evolving threats.</p>
