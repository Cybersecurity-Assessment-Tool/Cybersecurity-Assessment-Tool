        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security best practices by implementing an employee acceptable use policy and conducting regular security awareness training for both new and existing employees. These measures contribute positively to the human element of cybersecurity. However, a significant gap exists in the implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. This lack of MFA presents a substantial vulnerability that could undermine the effectiveness of other security controls.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee inboxes if credentials are compromised (e.g., via phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing). Compromised email accounts can lead to further attacks, such as business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, or lateral movement within the network. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on email access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email accounts</li><li>Email servers</li><li>User credentials</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for logging into computers. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if user credentials are stolen or guessed. An attacker gaining access to a computer can potentially access internal resources, install malware, or escalate privileges, leading to broader network compromise. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on computer login.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Servers</li><li>Network access points</li><li>User credentials</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for accessing sensitive data systems. This is a critical vulnerability as it means that a single compromised password could grant an attacker direct access to confidential information, intellectual property, or customer data. The impact could include data breaches, regulatory fines, reputational damage, and significant financial losses. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on sensitive data systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>File shares</li><li>Cloud storage</li><li>User credentials</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization implements Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points. This should include email access, computer logins, and access to all sensitive data systems. Prioritize the deployment of MFA for sensitive data systems due to the severe impact of potential breaches. Evaluate and deploy a robust MFA solution that aligns with the organization's infrastructure and user needs, such as hardware tokens, authenticator applications, or biometric methods. Additionally, conduct comprehensive user training on the importance and proper usage of MFA to ensure successful adoption and maximize security benefits.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization has established a positive security culture through its acceptable use policy and consistent security awareness training. However, the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems represents a critical vulnerability that significantly elevates the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches. While training helps prevent some incidents, the lack of MFA leaves the organization highly susceptible to credential-based attacks. Addressing these MFA deficiencies is paramount to enhancing the organization's overall security posture and readiness against modern cyber threats, transforming it from a good foundation to a robust defense.</p>
