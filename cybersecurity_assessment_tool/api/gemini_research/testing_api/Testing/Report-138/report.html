        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization exhibits a mixed security posture. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is in place for email and computer logins, it is critically absent for sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization lacks fundamental security practices, including an employee acceptable use policy and regular security awareness training for all employees, including new hires. A recent network scan indicated that port 80 is closed on the scanned host.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unencrypted Web Server - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A web server was identified running on port 80 without encryption. This allows for unencrypted data transmission, making sensitive information vulnerable to interception and eavesdropping. The presence of an open, unencrypted port 80 was identified during the assessment.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to enhance access control. Furthermore, the organization must develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to establish clear guidelines for technology usage. Regular security awareness training should be initiated for all new employees and conducted annually for the entire workforce to foster a security-conscious culture. Regarding the unencrypted web server, the immediate fix is to close port 80 if it's not essential, or for long-term security, implement SSL/TLS encryption for all web traffic to ensure data confidentiality.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks stemming from critical gaps in its security posture. While some MFA is in place, the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems, coupled with a lack of essential security policies and employee training, creates substantial vulnerabilities. The identified unencrypted web server further exacerbates the risk of data exposure. Addressing these issues through policy implementation, comprehensive training, and technical controls is crucial for improving the organization's overall security readiness and protecting its assets.</p>
