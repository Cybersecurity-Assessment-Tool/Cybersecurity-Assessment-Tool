        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open MySQL port (3306) running version 5.7.33, indicating potential database exposure. Internally, the organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and computer logins, and maintains an employee acceptable use policy along with regular security awareness training. However, a critical gap exists as MFA is not required for accessing sensitive data systems.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network, exposing the database service. This could allow unauthorized access to the database if not properly secured, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized data manipulation. The vulnerability was identified through network scanning.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted IP addresses or internal networks. For a more robust long-term solution, consider placing the database behind a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or implementing a secure bastion host for access. Furthermore, it is critical to extend Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) requirements to all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access, aligning with the existing MFA policies for email and computer logins.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security through its acceptable use policy and consistent security awareness training. The implementation of MFA for email and computer logins is a positive step. However, the presence of an open MySQL port and the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems represent significant vulnerabilities that could lead to data compromise. Addressing these critical gaps is paramount to enhancing the organization's overall security posture and readiness against cyber threats.</p>
