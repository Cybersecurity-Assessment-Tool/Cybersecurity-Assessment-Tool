        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Based on the provided data, the organization has some foundational security controls in place, such as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and sensitive data systems, and an acceptable use policy. However, critical vulnerabilities exist, including an exposed localhost service and significant gaps in human-centric security measures. Specifically, the absence of MFA for email access and a complete lack of security awareness training for employees pose substantial risks to the organization's overall security posture. Network scans indicate an open SSH port, which, if not properly secured, could be related to the exposed localhost risk.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A critical 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability often implies an internal service, intended for local access only, is inadvertently exposed to the network or even the internet. This could lead to unauthorized access to internal systems, data exfiltration, or further network compromise. Given the Nmap scan shows port 22 (SSH) open, this exposure could be related to an SSH service that is not properly restricted, allowing external entities to potentially interact with an internal-facing service.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Network Host</li><li>SSH Service on Host</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for email access. Email accounts are frequently targeted by phishing attacks and are a common entry point for attackers. Without MFA, a compromised password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's email, leading to business email compromise (BEC), data theft, or further credential harvesting. This significantly increases the risk of account takeover and lateral movement within the organization.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email System</li><li>Employee Email Accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Regular Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or annually for all employees. This leaves employees vulnerable to social engineering attacks (phishing, vishing, smishing), malware, and other common cyber threats. A lack of training means employees may not recognize malicious attempts, leading to inadvertent security breaches, data loss, or system compromise. Human error is a leading cause of security incidents, making this a systemic vulnerability.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All Employees</li><li>Organizational Security Posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately investigate and remediate the 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability, ensuring that any internal services are not inadvertently accessible externally, especially via the open SSH port. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts to significantly reduce the risk of account takeover and enhance credential security. Furthermore, establish and enforce a comprehensive security awareness training program for all employees, including new hires and annual refreshers, to educate them on common cyber threats and best security practices. Regularly review and update security policies and configurations to ensure ongoing protection and adapt to evolving threat landscapes.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces a critical security risk due to an exposed localhost service and significant human-centric vulnerabilities stemming from the lack of MFA for email and the absence of regular security awareness training. While some security policies are in place, these critical gaps undermine the overall security readiness. Addressing these issues promptly is crucial to prevent potential data breaches, unauthorized access, and other cyber incidents, thereby strengthening the organization's defense against evolving threats.</p>
