        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>A comprehensive network summary based on scan data is not possible due to broken input. However, an assessment based on organizational policies reveals that the organization has an acceptable use policy and conducts annual security awareness training for all employees. Critical gaps exist in the implementation of multi-factor authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, and there is no dedicated security awareness training for new employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for email access. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks. If an attacker gains access to an employee's email, they could potentially access sensitive information, impersonate the employee, or launch further attacks within the organization. This vulnerability was identified through the provided organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email accounts</li><li>Email servers</li><li>User workstations</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for computer logins. This leaves employee workstations vulnerable to unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or guessed. An attacker gaining access to a workstation could potentially access internal systems, sensitive data, or deploy malware. This vulnerability was identified through the provided organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network access points</li><li>Identity management systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. This means new hires may not be immediately aware of critical security policies, common threats (like phishing), and best practices, making them more susceptible to social engineering attacks and potentially introducing vulnerabilities from day one. While annual training is conducted, the initial onboarding period represents a critical gap. This vulnerability was identified through the provided organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network security</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and computer logins across the organization to significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access. Develop and implement a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees as part of their onboarding process, covering essential security policies, threat identification, and reporting procedures. Regularly review and update existing security awareness training content to address emerging threats and ensure its effectiveness.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security through its acceptable use policy and annual security awareness training. However, critical vulnerabilities exist due to the absence of multi-factor authentication for email and computer logins, significantly increasing the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. Furthermore, the lack of initial security awareness training for new employees presents a gap that could lead to early security incidents. Addressing these areas is paramount to enhancing the organization's overall security posture and readiness against modern cyber threats.</p>
