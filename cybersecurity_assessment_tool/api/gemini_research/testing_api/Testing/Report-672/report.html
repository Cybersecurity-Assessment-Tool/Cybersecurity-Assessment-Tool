        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems, and by having an acceptable use policy and initial security awareness training for new employees. However, critical gaps exist in the security posture, specifically regarding the absence of MFA for computer logins and the lack of recurring annual security awareness training for all employees. These omissions present significant vulnerabilities that could be exploited by threat actors.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee workstations and the internal network if credentials are stolen or compromised through phishing, malware, or brute-force attacks. A single compromised password, without a second factor, can grant an attacker full access to an employee's machine and potentially facilitate lateral movement within the network. This vulnerability was identified through the organization's self-reported data indicating 'No' for MFA on computer logins.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Internal network access</li><li>User accounts</li><li>Sensitive data on local machines</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Ongoing Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive initial security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This leaves the entire workforce susceptible to evolving social engineering tactics, sophisticated phishing attempts, and other human-factor vulnerabilities. Regular and mandatory training is crucial to keep employees informed about current threats, best practices for identifying malicious activities, and their role in maintaining organizational security, thereby reducing the likelihood of successful attacks that exploit human error. This vulnerability was identified through the organization's self-reported data indicating 'No' for annual security awareness training for all employees.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data susceptible to social engineering</li><li>Email systems</li><li>Internal applications</li><li>Network perimeter (via phishing)</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins across the entire organization. This will add a crucial layer of defense against credential theft. Furthermore, a mandatory annual security awareness training program should be established for all employees. This training should cover current threat landscapes, phishing recognition, social engineering tactics, and best practices for data handling, ensuring that the human element remains a strong line of defense against cyber threats.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization has a commendable foundation with MFA for sensitive systems and initial employee training. However, the absence of MFA for computer logins and the lack of ongoing, annual security awareness training for all employees represent critical vulnerabilities. Addressing these areas is paramount to bolstering the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and reducing its susceptibility to common and impactful cyberattacks.</p>
