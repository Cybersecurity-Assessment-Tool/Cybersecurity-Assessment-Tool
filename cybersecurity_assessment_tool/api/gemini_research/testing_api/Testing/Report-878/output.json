            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network includes an FTP server (vsftpd 2.3.4) with an open port 21, configured to allow anonymous login. Several critical security controls are absent, including multi-factor authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. Additionally, a significant portion of workstations are running outdated Windows 7 operating systems. Positively, the organization has an acceptable use policy and conducts regular security awareness training for all employees.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Anonymous FTP Access",
                        "Overview": "The FTP server (vsftpd 2.3.4) on port 21 is configured to allow anonymous login. This allows unauthorized users to access and potentially modify files on the server without authentication, leading to data breaches, unauthorized data modification, or the introduction of malicious content. This was identified via an Nmap scan with the 'ftp-anon' script.",
                        "Severity": "High",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Outdated Operating System",
                        "Overview": "Computers are running Windows 7, an operating system that has reached its end-of-life. This means it no longer receives security updates, making systems highly vulnerable to known exploits and malware. The impact includes increased risk of system compromise, data loss, and non-compliance with security standards.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Workstations"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Insufficient Authentication Controls",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email, logging into computers, or accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through credential stuffing, phishing, or brute-force attacks, as a single compromised password can grant full access.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Email access",
                            "Computer login",
                            "Sensitive data systems"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "It is strongly recommended to immediately disable anonymous FTP access on the vsftpd server and enforce strong authentication for all FTP operations; consider migrating to more secure protocols like SFTP or FTPS. All workstations running Windows 7 must be upgraded to a currently supported operating system, such as Windows 10 or 11, with a plan for hardware refitting where necessary. Crucially, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) should be implemented and enforced across all critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, to significantly reduce the risk of account compromise. Furthermore, regular patching and updating of all software and operating systems, along with periodic vulnerability scans and penetration tests, are essential for maintaining a robust security posture.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization faces several significant cybersecurity risks, primarily stemming from an exposed FTP server allowing anonymous access, the widespread use of end-of-life Windows 7 operating systems, and a complete lack of Multi-Factor Authentication across critical access points. While the organization demonstrates good practices in security awareness training and acceptable use policies, these foundational vulnerabilities severely undermine its overall security readiness, leaving it highly susceptible to data breaches and system compromises."
