        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to identity and access management by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. This significantly enhances protection against unauthorized access via compromised credentials. However, critical gaps exist in foundational security practices. There is no employee acceptable use policy in place, and security awareness training is not conducted for new employees or annually for all staff. The network scan identified an open SSH port (22), and a critical vulnerability, 'Localhost Exposed', indicates potential exposure of internal services, which could be exploited given the lack of comprehensive security policies and training.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A critical vulnerability where internal services or configurations are exposed, potentially making them accessible from external networks. This could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to internal systems, sensitive data, or pivot further into the network. The presence of an open SSH port (22) on the network could be a vector for exploiting such an exposure. This was identified through a vulnerability assessment.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The absence of an acceptable use policy leaves employees without clear guidelines on the proper and secure use of organizational IT resources. This increases the risk of misuse, accidental data breaches, and non-compliance with security best practices, as employees may unknowingly engage in risky behaviors. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Organizational Policy</li><li>Employee Behavior</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or annually for all staff. This significantly elevates the risk of successful social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) and other human-factor vulnerabilities. Employees are less likely to recognize and report threats, making the organization more susceptible to breaches. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee Knowledge</li><li>Organizational Culture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is imperative to immediately investigate and secure any services exposed from localhost, particularly those accessible via the open SSH port (22). Implement strict access controls, consider using VPNs or jump boxes for SSH access, and ensure all exposed services are properly authenticated and authorized. Concurrently, develop and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy that clearly outlines expectations for secure IT resource usage. Furthermore, establish a mandatory security awareness training program for all new hires and conduct annual refresher training for all employees to educate them on common threats, secure practices, and the importance of reporting suspicious activities. Regularly review and update these policies and training materials to adapt to evolving threat landscapes.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has a commendable stance on MFA implementation, significant vulnerabilities exist due to the lack of fundamental security policies and training, coupled with a critical network exposure. Addressing the 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability and establishing robust security awareness training and an acceptable use policy are critical steps to enhance the organization's overall security posture and readiness against cyber threats.</p>
