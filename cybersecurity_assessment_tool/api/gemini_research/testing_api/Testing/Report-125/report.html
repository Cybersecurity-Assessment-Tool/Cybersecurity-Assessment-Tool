        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network exhibits an open Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) port (3389), indicating potential external exposure. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for email access, it is notably absent for computer logins and sensitive data systems, representing a significant security gap. Furthermore, the organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy and does not provide security awareness training for new employees, although annual training is conducted for all staff.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>RDP Exposure - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed to the internet via an open port (3389). This allows potential attackers to attempt brute-force attacks or exploit vulnerabilities in the RDP service, leading to unauthorized access to internal systems. This was identified through a network scan revealing an open port 3389.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>External IP Address</li><li>Port 3389 (ms-wbt-server)</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediately close the exposed RDP port (3389) to mitigate the critical risk of unauthorized access. For legitimate remote access, implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution. Furthermore, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and access to sensitive data systems to significantly enhance access control. Develop and enforce an employee acceptable use policy to define expected behavior and security responsibilities. Introduce mandatory security awareness training for all new employees during onboarding to ensure foundational security knowledge from day one.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization faces a critical security vulnerability due to an exposed RDP port, which poses a direct threat of unauthorized system access. Significant gaps exist in access control, specifically the lack of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems. Additionally, the absence of an acceptable use policy and initial security awareness training for new hires indicates a need for improved foundational security practices. While annual security training is conducted, these identified areas require immediate attention to strengthen the overall security posture and readiness against cyber threats.</p>
