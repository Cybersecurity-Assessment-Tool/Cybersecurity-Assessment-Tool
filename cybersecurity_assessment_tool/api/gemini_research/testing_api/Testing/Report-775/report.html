        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open SSH port (22) on at least one host. The organizational security posture indicates several areas for improvement. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required for computer logins, it is notably absent for email and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees, despite providing it for new hires. These gaps suggest a moderate to high-risk security environment.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. Compromised email accounts can lead to further internal system breaches, data exfiltration, and business email compromise (BEC) scams.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>employee accounts</li><li>organizational data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for accessing systems containing sensitive data. This leaves critical information vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are compromised. Attackers gaining access to these systems could lead to severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, financial losses, and reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>databases</li><li>critical applications</li><li>confidential information</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not have an established employee acceptable use policy. This lack of clear guidelines means employees may unknowingly engage in activities that pose security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling company data. Without a policy, it is difficult to enforce security best practices and hold employees accountable for their actions.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee workstations</li><li>network resources</li><li>data handling practices</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual training for all employees. This oversight means that existing employees may not be updated on the latest threats, phishing techniques, or evolving security policies and best practices. A lack of ongoing training can lead to a decline in security vigilance and an increased susceptibility to social engineering attacks.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>organizational security culture</li><li>susceptibility to social engineering</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port (22) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A network scan identified an open SSH (Secure Shell) port (22) on at least one host. While SSH is a secure protocol for remote access, an open port represents a potential attack surface if not properly secured with strong authentication (e.g., key-based authentication, MFA) and restricted access controls (e.g., IP whitelisting). Unsecured SSH ports are frequently targeted by automated bots attempting brute-force attacks to gain unauthorized access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host(s) with open port 22</li><li>network perimeter</li><li>remote access infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, the organization should immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and sensitive data systems to significantly enhance credential security. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy that clearly outlines expected behavior regarding IT resources and data handling. Establish a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees to ensure continuous education on current threats and best practices. For the identified open SSH port, review and strengthen its security configuration by implementing key-based authentication, disabling password authentication, restricting access to authorized IP addresses, and ensuring regular patching and monitoring of the SSH server.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several significant cybersecurity vulnerabilities, primarily stemming from gaps in its security policies and practices, particularly concerning Multi-Factor Authentication for critical systems and comprehensive employee training. The presence of an open SSH port also presents a potential entry point for attackers. While MFA is in place for computer logins, the absence of it for email and sensitive data systems, coupled with a lack of an acceptable use policy and annual security training, indicates a moderate to high-risk security posture. Addressing these issues proactively is crucial for enhancing the organization's overall resilience against cyber threats and protecting its valuable assets.</p>
