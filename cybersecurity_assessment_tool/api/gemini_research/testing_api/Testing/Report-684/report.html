        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The provided network scan data was incomplete, preventing a detailed assessment of the network infrastructure. However, an analysis of organizational data indicates a strong commitment to multi-factor authentication (MFA), which is implemented for email access, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. This significantly enhances protection against unauthorized access. While annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees, there are notable gaps in foundational security policies and initial employee training, which could expose the organization to preventable risks.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). An AUP is crucial for defining the proper and acceptable use of organizational IT assets, systems, and data by employees. Without clear guidelines, employees may inadvertently or intentionally engage in activities that compromise security, such as improper data handling, unauthorized software installation, or risky internet browsing, leading to increased exposure to malware, data breaches, and compliance violations. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating no such policy is in place.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational IT systems</li><li>Sensitive data</li><li>Network resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Onboarding Security Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While the organization conducts annual security awareness training for all employees, there is no specific security awareness training provided to new employees during their onboarding process. This creates a critical window where new hires, unfamiliar with the organization's specific security protocols, common threats (e.g., phishing tactics), and data handling best practices, are more susceptible to social engineering attacks or accidental security lapses. This oversight can lead to initial security vulnerabilities that could be exploited before they receive general annual training. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Email systems</li><li>Internal networks</li><li>Organizational data</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization develop and implement a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) that clearly outlines expectations for employee conduct regarding IT asset usage, data handling, and internet access. This AUP should be mandatory for all employees and regularly reviewed. Furthermore, a dedicated security awareness training program must be established for all new employees as an integral part of their onboarding process. This initial training should cover essential security practices, common threats, and the organization's specific security policies to ensure new hires are security-conscious from day one. Continuing the annual security awareness training for all employees is also vital for ongoing reinforcement.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a commendable commitment to security through its widespread implementation of multi-factor authentication across critical access points. However, the absence of an Employee Acceptable Use Policy and the lack of dedicated security awareness training for new employees represent significant gaps in the overall security posture. Addressing these policy and training deficiencies is crucial to enhancing the organization's readiness against human-factor risks and ensuring a more robust and resilient cybersecurity environment.</p>
