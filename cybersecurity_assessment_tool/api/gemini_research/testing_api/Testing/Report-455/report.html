        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan identified an open SSH port (22) on at least one host, indicating a potential entry point that requires robust security measures. From an organizational policy standpoint, while Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is utilized for email access, it is notably absent for computer logins and sensitive data systems, creating significant authentication vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy, which can lead to inconsistent and potentially risky employee behavior. Security awareness training is conducted annually for all employees, but new hires do not receive initial security awareness training, leaving a critical gap in early employee education regarding cybersecurity best practices.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port (22) - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH port (22) was detected on a host within the network. While SSH is a critical service for remote administration, an exposed port without stringent security controls (e.g., strong authentication, IP restrictions, rate limiting) presents a high risk. Attackers can leverage this port for brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or exploiting SSH vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to the system, potentially leading to full system compromise or lateral movement within the network. The identification was made through an Nmap network scan.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with open port 22</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee workstations and potentially other network resources if user credentials are stolen, phished, or compromised through other means. A single factor (password) is insufficient to protect against modern cyber threats, making systems vulnerable to account takeover. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Servers requiring login</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk, as compromised credentials could grant attackers direct and unfettered access to confidential information, intellectual property, or personally identifiable information (PII). A breach of these systems could lead to severe data loss, regulatory non-compliance (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA), significant financial penalties, and severe reputational damage. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>File shares containing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. Without an AUP, there are no clear, documented guidelines for employees regarding the appropriate and secure use of company IT resources, internet access, email, and other digital assets. This absence can lead to inconsistent security practices, increased exposure to malware (e.g., through unauthorized software installations or risky browsing habits), data leakage, and potential legal liabilities due to employee misuse or negligence. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Incomplete Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive dedicated security awareness training upon onboarding. This leaves new hires vulnerable to common social engineering attacks, such as phishing, pretexting, and business email compromise, from their first day. Without foundational knowledge of security best practices and organizational policies, new employees may inadvertently introduce risks to the network, compromise sensitive information, or fall victim to scams, potentially leading to breaches or operational disruptions. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement robust security measures for the open SSH port, including disabling password authentication in favor of key-based authentication, restricting access to trusted IP addresses via firewall rules, and deploying intrusion prevention systems like Fail2Ban. Crucially, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be mandated for all computer logins and, with utmost priority, for access to all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access from compromised credentials. The organization should develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy, clearly outlining expectations for secure IT resource usage. Furthermore, a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees must be established as part of the onboarding process, complementing the existing annual training to ensure a consistent and strong security culture from day one.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several significant cybersecurity vulnerabilities, primarily stemming from an exposed SSH port, critical gaps in Multi-Factor Authentication implementation for computer logins and sensitive data systems, and the absence of a formal acceptable use policy. While annual security awareness training is a positive step, the lack of initial training for new employees represents a notable weakness. These findings indicate a moderate to high overall risk posture, with particular concern for data integrity and unauthorized access. Addressing these vulnerabilities through immediate technical controls and policy enhancements is essential to significantly improve the organization's cybersecurity readiness and protect against potential threats.</p>
