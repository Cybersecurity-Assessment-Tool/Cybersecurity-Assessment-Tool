                "Summary": "The organization currently employs Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and computer logins, indicating a foundational level of access control. However, a significant gap exists as MFA is not required for accessing sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not provide security awareness training for new employees, although annual training is conducted for all existing employees. Network scanning revealed that port 80 is closed, suggesting no unencrypted web server is directly exposed on this port.",

                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information should a single factor (e.g., password) be compromised. The absence of this control makes these systems highly vulnerable to credential stuffing, phishing, and brute-force attacks.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                    {
                        "Risk": "Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy",
                        "Overview": "The organization currently operates without a formal employee acceptable use policy. This lack of clear guidelines for appropriate use of company resources, internet, and email can lead to various security incidents, including data leakage, malware infections from unauthorized software installations, and reputational damage due to inappropriate online behavior. It also complicates incident response and disciplinary actions.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                    {
                        "Risk": "No Security Awareness Training for New Employees",
                        "Overview": "New employees are not provided with mandatory security awareness training upon joining the organization. This leaves them unprepared for common cyber threats such as phishing, social engineering, and malware, making them potential weak links in the organization's security posture from day one. This increases the likelihood of initial compromise through human error.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "New employees",
                            "Company systems",
                            "Data"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access even if primary credentials are compromised. A comprehensive employee acceptable use policy should be developed, communicated, and enforced to establish clear guidelines for resource usage and mitigate risks associated with employee behavior. Furthermore, mandatory security awareness training must be introduced for all new employees as part of their onboarding process to ensure they are equipped to identify and respond to cyber threats from the outset. The existing annual security awareness training for all employees should continue to reinforce best practices.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security by implementing MFA for email and computer logins, and conducting annual security awareness training. However, critical vulnerabilities exist, particularly the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems, the lack of an acceptable use policy, and the omission of security awareness training for new hires. Addressing these gaps is crucial for improving overall readiness against cyber threats and protecting sensitive organizational assets."
