        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to security awareness training for all employees, including new hires, and maintains an acceptable use policy. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is effectively implemented for computer logins and access to sensitive data systems, which is a commendable security posture. However, a critical vulnerability was identified where port 8080 is open and exposes a service titled 'TOP SECRET DB', indicating a severe data exposure risk. Additionally, the absence of MFA for email access presents a significant vulnerability, increasing the risk of account compromise and unauthorized access to sensitive communications.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed 'TOP SECRET DB' on Port 8080 - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Port 8080 is open and accessible, revealing an HTTP title 'TOP SECRET DB'. This indicates a highly sensitive database or application is directly exposed to the network, potentially without adequate authentication or encryption. This vulnerability poses a critical risk of unauthorized access, data exfiltration, and severe data breaches. The exposure was identified via an Nmap scan utilizing the http-title script.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li><li>TOP SECRET DB application/service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of email account compromise through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks. A compromised email account can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive communications, impersonation, and serve as a pivot point for further attacks within the organization's network. This policy gap was identified through organizational data review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee email accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediate action is required to address the critical exposure on port 8080. It is strongly recommended to either shut down the service on port 8080 if it is not essential, or implement robust security controls including strong authentication, strict access controls, and encryption if the service must remain active. A thorough security audit and penetration test of this specific service are also highly advised. Furthermore, implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access across the organization to significantly reduce the risk of email account compromise. Continue to enforce existing security awareness training programs and acceptable use policies to maintain a strong security culture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has established good practices in security awareness training and MFA for sensitive systems and computer logins, the identified critical vulnerability on port 8080 exposing a 'TOP SECRET DB' and the high-risk absence of MFA for email access represent significant security gaps. These vulnerabilities could lead to severe data breaches and unauthorized access. Prompt and decisive action on these critical and high-severity risks is essential to enhance the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and protect its sensitive assets.</p>
