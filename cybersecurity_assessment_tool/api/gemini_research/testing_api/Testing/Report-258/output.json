            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security through mandatory MFA for computer logins and regular security awareness training for all employees. However, critical gaps exist in the implementation of multi-factor authentication for email and sensitive data systems, leaving these crucial access points vulnerable. Furthermore, the absence of an employee acceptable use policy indicates a lack of formal guidelines for employee conduct regarding IT resources. Network scans indicate that port 80 is currently closed, which contradicts a previously identified vulnerability regarding an unencrypted web server.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Unencrypted Web Server",
                        "Overview": "Port 80 is open. This exposes unencrypted traffic, making it susceptible to eavesdropping and data interception. This vulnerability was identified through a previous assessment, though current network scans indicate port 80 is closed.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Port 80"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access. Developing and enforcing a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy is crucial for establishing clear guidelines for responsible technology usage and mitigating insider risks. Additionally, while current scans show port 80 as closed, it is vital to ensure that any future or existing web services are configured to use HTTPS with valid SSL/TLS certificates to encrypt all data in transit, protecting against eavesdropping and data tampering.",
            "Conclusion": "In conclusion, the organization has established a baseline for security with MFA for computer logins and ongoing security awareness training. However, significant vulnerabilities persist due to the absence of MFA for email and sensitive data systems, and the lack of an acceptable use policy. Addressing these critical areas, alongside ensuring secure configurations for all web services, will substantially improve the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and reduce its attack surface."
