        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) port (3389), indicating potential external exposure. Internally, the organization utilizes MFA for email and sensitive data systems but lacks MFA for computer logins. Furthermore, there is no employee acceptable use policy in place, though security awareness training is conducted for all employees annually and for new hires.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>RDP Exposure - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed externally on port 3389. This allows potential attackers to attempt brute-force attacks or exploit RDP vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to internal systems. The impact could range from unauthorized access to data breaches and system compromise. This was identified via network scanning showing an open RDP port.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication. The impact could lead to lateral movement within the network and access to internal resources. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers</li><li>Internal network access</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines, employees may engage in activities that inadvertently introduce security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive data. This increases the overall attack surface and compliance risks. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data and systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately close the externally exposed RDP port (3389) and implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) for secure remote access. Additionally, implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to enhance credential security and prevent unauthorized access. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to establish clear guidelines for technology usage and data handling, reducing human-factor risks. Regular security awareness training should continue to reinforce best practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces critical and high-severity vulnerabilities, primarily due to an exposed RDP service and a lack of MFA for computer logins. The absence of an acceptable use policy further contributes to the overall risk posture. While security awareness training is in place, these fundamental security gaps significantly reduce the organization's readiness against cyber threats. Addressing these issues promptly is crucial for improving the overall security posture and protecting organizational assets.</p>
