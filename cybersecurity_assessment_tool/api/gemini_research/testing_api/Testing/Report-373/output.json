            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization operates an Nginx web server on port 443 (HTTPS). While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is in place for email and sensitive data systems, it is not required for computer logins. The organization has an acceptable use policy and provides security awareness training for new employees, but does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Outdated Web Server Software",
                        "Overview": "The Nmap scan identified an Nginx web server running version 1.18.0. This is an older stable release, and while not immediately critical, older software versions often contain known vulnerabilities that have been patched in newer releases. Running outdated software increases the attack surface and the risk of exploitation by attackers aware of these public vulnerabilities.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Nginx 1.18.0 web server",
                            "Port 443 (HTTPS)"

                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Logins",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee workstations and internal systems if an attacker obtains employee credentials through phishing, brute-force, or credential stuffing attacks. Without a second factor, a compromised password can be sufficient for an attacker to gain access.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Employee workstations",
                            "Internal network access",
                            "User accounts"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual training for all employees. This leads to a degradation of security knowledge over time, making employees more susceptible to evolving social engineering tactics, phishing attempts, and other human-centric attacks. A well-trained workforce is a critical first line of defense.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "Organizational data",
                            "Network security"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "It is strongly recommended to upgrade the Nginx web server to the latest stable version to mitigate known vulnerabilities and ensure ongoing security. Implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins is crucial to significantly enhance endpoint security and prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised. Furthermore, establishing a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees will ensure that the workforce remains vigilant against evolving cyber threats and maintains a strong security posture.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security with MFA for critical systems and an acceptable use policy. However, significant vulnerabilities exist concerning the lack of MFA for computer logins and the absence of annual security awareness training for all employees. Additionally, the use of an older Nginx web server version presents a potential attack vector. Addressing these areas proactively is essential to strengthen the overall cybersecurity readiness and reduce the risk of successful cyberattacks."
