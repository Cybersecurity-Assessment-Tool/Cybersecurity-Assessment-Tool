        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and computer logins, and maintaining an acceptable use policy. Annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees. However, critical gaps exist, particularly concerning the protection of sensitive data systems and the onboarding process for new employees, which currently lack essential security measures.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information should primary credentials be compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or other means. Without MFA, a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to sensitive organizational data, leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and reputational damage. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'Do you require MFA to access sensitive data systems?':'No'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Confidential organizational data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently does not provide security awareness training for new employees during their onboarding process. This leaves new hires vulnerable to common cyber threats such as phishing, social engineering, and malware, as they may not be equipped with the knowledge to identify and report suspicious activities. Untrained new employees can inadvertently become an entry point for attackers, compromising the organization's security posture. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'Does your organization do security awareness training for new employees?':'No'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational network</li><li>Employee endpoints</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems immediately. This will add a crucial layer of security, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access even if primary credentials are stolen. Furthermore, a mandatory security awareness training program should be established for all new employees as part of their onboarding process. This training should cover common cyber threats, best practices for data handling, and the importance of reporting suspicious activities, ensuring that all personnel are equipped to be a strong line of defense against cyberattacks. Regular review and updates to the annual security awareness training content are also advised to address evolving threat landscapes.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization exhibits a mixed security posture. While positive steps have been taken with MFA for email and computer logins, and annual security awareness training, critical vulnerabilities remain. The absence of MFA for sensitive data systems and the lack of security awareness training for new employees represent significant risks that could lead to data breaches and compromise the overall security of the organization. Addressing these gaps is paramount to enhancing the organization's readiness against cyber threats and protecting its valuable assets.</p>
