        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and conducting regular security awareness training for all employees, including new hires. However, significant vulnerabilities exist in critical areas. The absence of MFA for computer logins and access to sensitive data systems leaves the organization highly susceptible to unauthorized access and data breaches if credentials are compromised. Furthermore, the lack of an Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) indicates a gap in establishing clear guidelines for employee conduct regarding IT resources, potentially leading to misuse or security incidents.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Authentication for Workstations - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for employee computer logins. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to internal systems and data if an employee's credentials are compromised through phishing, malware, or brute-force attacks. Without a second factor, a stolen password is often sufficient for an attacker to gain entry, potentially leading to lateral movement within the network.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Internal network access points</li><li>Active Directory/Identity Management Systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Authentication for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access systems containing sensitive data. This poses a critical risk, as compromised credentials could grant attackers direct access to confidential information, leading to severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and significant reputational damage. The absence of MFA on these critical systems makes them prime targets for sophisticated attackers seeking high-value data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Databases storing PII/PHI/financial data</li><li>File servers with confidential documents</li><li>CRM systems</li><li>HR systems</li><li>Financial applications</li><li>Cloud storage for sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Missing Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). Without an AUP, employees may not have clear guidelines regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, internet access, email, and data handling. This can lead to increased risks of data leakage, malware infections due to inappropriate web browsing, non-compliance with security best practices, and potential legal liabilities arising from employee misuse or negligence.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources (hardware, software, network)</li><li>Data handling procedures</li><li>Overall security posture and compliance</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all employee computer logins and, critically, for access to all systems containing sensitive data. This will create a robust barrier against credential theft and unauthorized access. Concurrently, the organization must develop and formally implement a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). This policy should clearly define expectations for employee conduct regarding IT asset usage, data handling, and internet/email etiquette, ensuring all personnel understand their responsibilities in maintaining a secure environment. Regular reinforcement of these policies through ongoing security awareness training is also crucial.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has established a good foundation with MFA for email and consistent security awareness training, critical vulnerabilities remain due to the absence of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, alongside the lack of an Acceptable Use Policy. Addressing these gaps is paramount to mitigating the high risk of unauthorized access and data breaches, thereby strengthening the overall cybersecurity readiness and protecting valuable organizational assets.</p>
