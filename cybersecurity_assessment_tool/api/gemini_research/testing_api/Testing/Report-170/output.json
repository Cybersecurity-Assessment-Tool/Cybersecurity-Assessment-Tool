            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network currently presents several significant security vulnerabilities. An Nmap scan identified an FTP server running vsftpd version 2.3.4, which is an outdated software known to have critical vulnerabilities, and it is configured to allow anonymous login. From an organizational policy standpoint, while Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required for email and sensitive data systems, it is notably absent for computer logins. Furthermore, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct security awareness training for new employees, though annual training is provided for all staff. A critical risk identified is the continued use of Windows 7 on workstations, an operating system that has reached its end-of-life and no longer receives security updates.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Outdated FTP Server Software",
                        "Overview": "The FTP server is running vsftpd version 2.3.4. This version was released in 2011 and is known to contain several critical vulnerabilities, including a backdoor (CVE-2011-2523). Running severely outdated software significantly increases the risk of system compromise through known exploits. This was identified via Nmap service detection.",

                        "Risk": "Anonymous FTP Login Allowed",
                        "Overview": "The FTP server is configured to allow anonymous login. This permits unauthorized users to access files on the server without authentication, potentially leading to data leakage, unauthorized file uploads (if write permissions are misconfigured), or serving as a staging ground for malicious activities. This was identified by the Nmap script 'ftp-anon'.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Computer Logins",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This significantly weakens the authentication process, making systems highly susceptible to credential stuffing, brute-force attacks, or phishing attempts. If a user's password is compromised, an attacker can gain direct access to the computer without an additional authentication factor.",
                        "Severity": "High",

                        "Risk": "Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy",
                        "Overview": "The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines on the appropriate use of company IT resources, employees may inadvertently engage in risky behaviors, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive data, increasing the overall attack surface and potential for security incidents.",

                        "Risk": "No Security Awareness Training for New Employees",
                        "Overview": "New employees do not receive security awareness training upon joining the organization. This leaves new hires vulnerable to common social engineering tactics like phishing and pretexting, as they may not be aware of organizational security protocols and best practices from the outset, increasing the risk of human error-induced breaches.",

                        "Risk": "Outdated Windows Policy (Windows 7)",
                        "Overview": "Several computers within the organization are running Windows 7. Windows 7 reached its end-of-life in January 2020 and no longer receives security updates from Microsoft. This means systems running Windows 7 are highly vulnerable to newly discovered exploits and malware, posing a critical risk to the organization's network security.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Workstations"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, immediate action is required. Firstly, the FTP server running vsftpd 2.3.4 must be upgraded to a current, supported version or replaced with a more secure file transfer solution. Anonymous FTP access should be disabled immediately, and access should be restricted to authorized users with strong authentication. Secondly, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) should be implemented for all computer logins to enhance credential security. Thirdly, a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy must be developed, communicated, and enforced across the organization. Additionally, a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees should be established to ensure they are equipped with essential security knowledge from day one. Finally, all workstations running Windows 7 must be upgraded to a currently supported operating system, such as Windows 10 or 11, to ensure they receive critical security updates and patches.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces a high level of cybersecurity risk due to a combination of outdated software, weak authentication practices, and significant gaps in security policies and employee training. The presence of an outdated and anonymously accessible FTP server, the lack of MFA for computer logins, the absence of an acceptable use policy, and the continued use of end-of-life operating systems like Windows 7 collectively create a vulnerable environment. Addressing these critical and high-severity risks promptly through the recommended actions is essential to significantly improve the organization's security posture and reduce its susceptibility to cyberattacks."
