            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization currently lacks multi-factor authentication (MFA) for email access and computer logins, significantly increasing the risk of unauthorized access through compromised credentials. While MFA is implemented for sensitive data systems, this partial coverage leaves critical entry points vulnerable. Furthermore, the absence of security awareness training for new employees and a lack of regular annual training for all staff indicates a gap in human-factor security, making the organization more susceptible to social engineering and phishing attacks.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "No MFA for Email Access",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of email account compromise through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks. A compromised email account can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and further internal network access. This was identified through organizational policy review.",

                        "Risk": "No MFA for Computer Login",
                        "Overview": "Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for employees to log into their computers. This makes workstations and servers vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials (username/password) are stolen or guessed. Successful compromise could lead to data access, malware deployment, and lateral movement within the network. This was identified through organizational policy review.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "No Security Awareness Training for New Employees",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not provide security awareness training for new employees. New hires, often unfamiliar with the organization's specific security policies and common threat vectors, are more susceptible to social engineering, phishing, and other human-factor attacks. This oversight increases the likelihood of initial compromise through employee error. This was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",

                    {
                        "Risk": "No Annual Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. Without regular training, employees may not be updated on the latest threats, phishing techniques, and best security practices. This leads to a degradation of security posture over time, making the entire workforce more vulnerable to evolving cyber threats. This was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "Organizational security posture"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, starting with email systems and computer logins. This measure will drastically reduce the risk of credential-based attacks. Concurrently, a comprehensive security awareness program should be established, including mandatory training for all new employees upon onboarding and annual refresher training for the entire staff. This will empower employees to recognize and report threats, transforming them into a strong line of defense against social engineering and phishing attacks. Regular policy reviews and updates are also advised to ensure alignment with current threat landscapes.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces significant security risks primarily due to the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer access, coupled with a complete lack of security awareness training for both new and existing employees. While an acceptable use policy is in place and MFA is used for sensitive data systems, these gaps leave the organization highly vulnerable to credential compromise and human-factor attacks. Addressing these fundamental weaknesses through the implementation of MFA and a robust security awareness program is critical to improving overall readiness and protecting against common cyber threats."
