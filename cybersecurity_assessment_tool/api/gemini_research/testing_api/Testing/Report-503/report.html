        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's current cybersecurity posture reveals several critical areas requiring immediate attention. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for email and sensitive data systems, a significant gap exists as MFA is not required for computer logins, increasing the risk of unauthorized access. Furthermore, the absence of an employee acceptable use policy and a lack of security awareness training for new employees introduce considerable human-factor risks. Network scans indicate an open SSH (port 22) service, which, if not properly secured, presents a common attack vector. A critical 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability has also been identified, indicating a severe misconfiguration or exposure.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A critical vulnerability related to localhost exposure has been identified, indicated by a CVSS score of 10.0. This typically means a service or interface intended for internal use is improperly accessible or configured, potentially allowing unauthorized access, information disclosure, or system compromise from external or less privileged internal sources. The exact nature of the exposure needs immediate investigation.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Weak Authentication for Computers - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly weakens the authentication process, making systems highly vulnerable to credential stuffing, brute-force attacks, or phishing attempts. If a single set of credentials is compromised, an attacker could gain full access to an employee's workstation without an additional authentication factor.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee Workstations</li><li>Network Login Systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines, employees may engage in activities that inadvertently introduce security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive data. This increases the likelihood of malware infections, data breaches, and non-compliance with industry regulations.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Organizational Policies</li><li>Employee Conduct</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive dedicated security awareness training upon onboarding. This leaves them unprepared for common cybersecurity threats like phishing, social engineering, and malware. Untrained new hires are more susceptible to becoming targets for attackers, potentially leading to human error-induced security incidents, data loss, or system compromise.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New Employee Onboarding Process</li><li>Human Resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed SSH Service (Port 22) - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A network scan identified an open SSH (port 22) service. While SSH is crucial for remote administration, an exposed port without robust security measures (e.g., strong key-based authentication, disabled password authentication, IP restrictions, rate limiting, MFA) presents a significant attack surface. This can lead to brute-force attacks, credential compromise, or exploitation of SSH vulnerabilities, granting unauthorized remote access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Network Perimeter</li><li>Servers with SSH enabled</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is imperative to implement several key security enhancements. Firstly, immediately investigate and remediate the 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability by restricting access and reconfiguring affected services. Secondly, mandate Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to significantly enhance endpoint security and protect against credential theft. Thirdly, develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to establish clear guidelines for secure behavior and data handling. Fourthly, integrate mandatory security awareness training into the new employee onboarding process to educate new hires on cybersecurity best practices from day one. Lastly, secure all exposed SSH services by disabling password authentication, enforcing key-based authentication, implementing IP-based access restrictions, and considering MFA for SSH access. Regular vulnerability scanning and patch management should also be established as ongoing practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces a mix of critical and high-severity vulnerabilities stemming from both technical configurations and human-factor elements. While some security controls like MFA for email and sensitive data are in place, the lack of MFA for computer logins, absence of an acceptable use policy, and insufficient new employee training create significant attack vectors. The identified 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability and open SSH port further underscore the need for immediate technical remediation. Addressing these gaps comprehensively is crucial for improving the overall security posture, reducing the risk of data breaches, and enhancing the organization's readiness against evolving cyber threats.</p>
