        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a mixed security posture. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for computer logins and sensitive data systems, a critical gap exists with email access, which remains unprotected by MFA. Furthermore, the absence of an employee acceptable use policy and a lack of annual security awareness training for all employees indicate significant areas for improvement in foundational security practices and human factor risk management. The provided network scan data is minimal, showing one host as 'up' with 'closed' extraports, but does not offer sufficient detail to assess specific network-level vulnerabilities beyond the organizational policy and training aspects.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unprotected Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Email accounts are a primary target for phishing and credential stuffing attacks. Without Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), compromised credentials can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive communications, data, and potentially other connected systems. This significantly increases the risk of data breaches and business email compromise (BEC) attacks, as identified by the organization's response indicating no MFA for email access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee email accounts</li><li>Email server/service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The lack of an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) means there are no formal guidelines for employees regarding the proper use of company IT resources, data handling, internet usage, and security best practices. This can lead to employees inadvertently or intentionally engaging in risky behaviors, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive data, increasing the risk of malware infections, data loss, and compliance violations. This was identified by the organization's response indicating no acceptable use policy.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the absence of annual training for all employees means that security knowledge can become outdated, and new threats or policies may not be effectively communicated. This leaves the organization vulnerable to social engineering attacks (phishing, vishing), malware, and human error, as employees may not be equipped to identify and respond to evolving cyber threats. This was identified by the organization's response indicating no annual security awareness training for all employees.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>It is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access to significantly reduce the risk of credential compromise and subsequent data breaches. Concurrently, a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) should be developed and enforced to establish clear guidelines for IT resource usage and data handling, mitigating risks associated with employee behavior. Furthermore, the organization should establish a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees to ensure up-to-date knowledge of cyber threats and best practices, reinforcing a strong security culture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently exhibits a moderate level of cybersecurity readiness, with key strengths in MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems. However, critical vulnerabilities exist in email security, employee policy enforcement, and ongoing security awareness training. Addressing these areas is paramount to bolstering the organization's defense against common cyber threats and fostering a more robust security posture.</p>
