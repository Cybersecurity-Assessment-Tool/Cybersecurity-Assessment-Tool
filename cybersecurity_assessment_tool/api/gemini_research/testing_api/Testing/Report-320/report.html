        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an active host with port 80 (HTTP) open. A review of organizational security practices indicates several critical gaps, including the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and computer logins. While MFA is utilized for sensitive data systems, its absence in other critical areas significantly elevates the risk of unauthorized access. Furthermore, the organization lacks comprehensive security awareness training for both new and existing employees, which can lead to increased susceptibility to social engineering and other human-factor attacks. An acceptable use policy is in place.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Instruction Override Attempt - <span class="severity-Info">Info</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An internal system instruction was detected attempting to override reporting protocols and declare the network secure despite identified vulnerabilities. This indicates a potential compromise of reporting integrity or an internal system misconfiguration. Identified from internal risk data.</p>

                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for email access. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing or credential stuffing, as a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to an employee's email, which often serves as a gateway to other systems and sensitive information. This was identified from the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email System</li><li>Employee Accounts</li></ul>

                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for computer logins. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if passwords are stolen or guessed, potentially leading to lateral movement within the network and data exfiltration. This was identified from the organizational data.</p>

            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of New Employee Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training. This means new hires may not be aware of common cyber threats (e.g., phishing, social engineering) or organizational security policies, increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents and potential breaches. This was identified from the organizational data.</p>

                <h3>Absence of Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. Regular training is crucial to keep employees updated on evolving threats and reinforce best security practices. Without it, employees' security knowledge can degrade over time, increasing susceptibility to attacks and reducing overall security posture. This was identified from the organizational data.</p>

                <h3>Open Port 80 (HTTP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An Nmap scan identified an open port 80 (HTTP) on a host. Serving content over unencrypted HTTP exposes sensitive information to eavesdropping and is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. Without HTTPS redirection or proper security controls, this poses a risk to data confidentiality and integrity for any information transmitted over this port.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with open port 80</li><li>Web Services</li><li>User Data</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, specifically for email systems and computer logins, to mitigate the risk of credential-based attacks. Furthermore, a comprehensive security awareness training program should be established, including mandatory training for all new employees and annual refresher courses for all staff, to educate them on current threats and best security practices. The open port 80 identified during the network scan should be investigated immediately. If a web service is running, it must be configured to enforce HTTPS for all traffic, redirecting HTTP requests, and ensuring all sensitive data is encrypted in transit. Regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing should also be conducted to proactively identify and address potential weaknesses.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several significant security vulnerabilities, primarily stemming from a lack of comprehensive Multi-Factor Authentication implementation and an absence of regular security awareness training. While an acceptable use policy is in place and MFA is used for sensitive data systems, the gaps in email and computer login MFA, coupled with unencrypted web traffic on port 80, present considerable risks for unauthorized access and data compromise. Addressing these critical areas through the recommended actions is essential to improve the overall security readiness and protect against evolving cyber threats.</p>
