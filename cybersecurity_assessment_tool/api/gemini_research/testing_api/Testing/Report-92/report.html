        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The network scan identified at least one active host with an open port 80, suggesting a web service is operational. The organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, which is a strong security practice. However, critical gaps exist in foundational security practices, specifically the absence of an employee acceptable use policy and any form of security awareness training for both new and existing employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Without a formal acceptable use policy, employees may unknowingly engage in activities that pose security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling company data. This increases the likelihood of data breaches, malware infections, and compliance violations. This vulnerability was identified through a review of organizational policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Untrained New Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees are often targets for social engineering attacks (phishing, pretexting) due to their unfamiliarity with organizational security protocols. The absence of initial security awareness training leaves them vulnerable and increases the risk of successful attacks that could compromise credentials or introduce malware. This vulnerability was identified through a review of organizational training programs.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Stale Security Awareness - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Without regular, annual security awareness training, employees' knowledge of current threats and best practices can become outdated. This increases the risk of human error leading to security incidents, as employees may not recognize new phishing techniques, social engineering tactics, or evolving data handling requirements. This vulnerability was identified through a review of organizational training programs.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, the organization should immediately develop and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable Use Policy, clearly outlining acceptable and unacceptable behaviors regarding company assets and data. Furthermore, mandatory security awareness training must be established for all new employees as part of their onboarding process, covering essential topics like phishing, social engineering, password hygiene, and data handling. This training should be reinforced with annual refresher courses for all employees to ensure their knowledge of evolving threats and best practices remains current. Regular simulated phishing campaigns could also be introduced to test and improve employee vigilance.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has commendably implemented Multi-Factor Authentication across critical access points, significantly enhancing its technical security posture, a substantial gap exists in its human element defenses. The absence of an acceptable use policy and any form of security awareness training for both new and existing employees leaves the organization highly susceptible to social engineering attacks, insider threats, and general human error. Addressing these foundational policy and training deficiencies is paramount to achieving a robust and comprehensive cybersecurity readiness.</p>
