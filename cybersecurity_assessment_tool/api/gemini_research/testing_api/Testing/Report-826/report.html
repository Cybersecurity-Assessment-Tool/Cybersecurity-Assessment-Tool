        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a strong security posture regarding Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) implementation across email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. An acceptable use policy is in place, and annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees. However, a notable gap exists in providing security awareness training for new employees upon onboarding, which could expose the organization to unnecessary risks.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of New Employee Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees are not receiving dedicated security awareness training upon joining the organization. This oversight can lead to new hires being unaware of critical security policies, common threat vectors (e.g., phishing, social engineering), and best practices for data handling. This significantly increases the risk of human error leading to security incidents, data breaches, or malware infections, as new employees are often targeted by adversaries who exploit lack of awareness. The impact could range from minor policy violations to major security breaches. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Implement a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees as an integral part of their onboarding process. This training should cover essential topics such as phishing recognition, password hygiene, data handling policies, incident reporting procedures, and the organization's acceptable use policy. Consider incorporating interactive modules and regular short refreshers within the first few months of employment to reinforce key concepts and ensure new hires are fully integrated into the organization's security culture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization exhibits a commendable level of readiness in several key areas, particularly with widespread MFA adoption and an established acceptable use policy. Annual security awareness training for existing staff is a strong point. The primary vulnerability identified is the absence of dedicated security awareness training for new employees, which presents a notable risk. Addressing this gap will further strengthen the organization's overall security posture and reduce the likelihood of incidents stemming from human factors during the critical onboarding phase, thereby enhancing overall resilience against cyber threats.</p>
