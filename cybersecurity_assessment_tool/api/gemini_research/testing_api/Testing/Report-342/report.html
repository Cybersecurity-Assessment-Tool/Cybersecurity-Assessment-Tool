        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to identity and access management by requiring Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and access to sensitive data systems. Network scans indicate that port 80 is closed, suggesting no immediate risk from unencrypted web services. However, significant gaps exist in foundational security policies and ongoing employee education. Specifically, there is no formal acceptable use policy for employees, and annual security awareness training is not conducted for all staff, leaving the organization vulnerable to human-centric risks and potential misuse of resources.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Missing Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. This absence creates a significant risk as it provides no clear guidelines for employees regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, internet access, and data handling. This can lead to misuse of company assets, increased exposure to malware, data leakage, and potential legal liabilities. The lack of a policy was identified during the review of organizational security practices.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational IT assets</li><li>Sensitive data</li><li>Legal compliance</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct this training for all employees at least once per year. This oversight means that existing employees may not be updated on the latest threats, best practices, or evolving company policies, making them more susceptible to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) and other human-factor vulnerabilities. This significantly increases the risk of security incidents originating from employee error or malicious intent. This gap was identified during the review of organizational security practices.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network security</li><li>Incident response capabilities</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to develop and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy, ensuring all employees are aware of and adhere to guidelines for IT resource usage and data handling. Furthermore, establishing a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees is crucial. This training should cover current threat landscapes, phishing recognition, data protection best practices, and incident reporting procedures to continuously educate and empower the workforce against evolving cyber threats. Regular network scans should also be performed to monitor for unexpected open ports or services.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization has a solid foundation in access control with widespread MFA implementation and a secure external network perimeter as indicated by the closed port 80. However, the absence of an acceptable use policy and the lack of annual security awareness training for all employees represent critical internal vulnerabilities. These gaps expose the organization to significant risks related to human error, policy non-compliance, and potential insider threats. Addressing these policy and training deficiencies is paramount to achieving a more robust and mature cybersecurity readiness.</p>
