                "Summary": "The organization's network scan revealed an open SSH port (22). Internal policy review indicates a lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, although MFA is used for sensitive data systems. An acceptable use policy is in place, and annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees. However, new employees do not receive initial security awareness training.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Email and Computer Logins",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require multi-factor authentication (MFA) for accessing email or logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are compromised through phishing, keylogging, or brute-force attacks. Without a second factor, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's email and workstation, potentially leading to further network penetration and data breaches. This was identified through the organizational data provided.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Open SSH Port (22) Without Mandated MFA",
                        "Overview": "An Nmap scan identified an open SSH port (22) on a host within the network. While SSH is a legitimate service for remote administration, its exposure without the enforcement of multi-factor authentication (as indicated by the lack of MFA for computer logins) presents a significant attack surface. Attackers can attempt brute-force attacks or exploit weak credentials to gain unauthorized remote access, potentially leading to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further internal network pivoting. This was identified via network scan data and correlated with organizational MFA policies.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Host with open port 22",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Absence of Security Awareness Training for New Employees",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees upon onboarding. While annual training is provided for all employees, the initial period for new hires is critical. Without immediate training, new employees are more susceptible to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) and may inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities or compromise sensitive information due to a lack of understanding of security best practices and organizational policies. This was identified through the organizational data provided.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "New employees",
                            "Organizational security posture",
                            "Data integrity"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and computer logins to significantly reduce the risk of credential compromise. For the identified open SSH port (22), implement robust security measures such as disabling password authentication in favor of key-based authentication, enforcing strong password policies, implementing rate limiting, and ideally, integrating MFA for SSH access. Furthermore, a mandatory security awareness training program should be established for all new employees during their onboarding process to ensure they are equipped with essential cybersecurity knowledge from day one.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces several significant security risks, primarily stemming from the lack of multi-factor authentication for critical access points like email and computer logins, and the exposure of an SSH service without adequate authentication controls. Additionally, the absence of initial security awareness training for new employees creates a vulnerability to social engineering. While an acceptable use policy and annual training are positive steps, these gaps in authentication and initial employee education leave the organization susceptible to unauthorized access and data breaches. Addressing these vulnerabilities is crucial for improving overall readiness against modern cyber threats."
