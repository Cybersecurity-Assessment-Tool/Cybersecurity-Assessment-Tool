        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently has a MySQL database running version 5.7.33 with port 3306 open. From an organizational security standpoint, the company has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and access to sensitive data systems. An employee acceptable use policy is in place, and annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees. However, security awareness training is not provided for new employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network. This exposes the database service to potential unauthorized access or attacks, which could lead to data breaches, data manipulation, or service disruption. This vulnerability was identified through a network scan showing an open MySQL port.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li><li>MySQL Database Server</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. This leaves new hires vulnerable to social engineering attacks, phishing, and other common cyber threats, potentially compromising organizational security from day one. This process gap was identified from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New Employees</li><li>Organizational Security Posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement strict firewall rules to restrict access to port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted IP addresses or internal networks. For long-term security, consider implementing a Virtual Private Network (VPN) for secure remote access to the database. Additionally, it is crucial to initiate mandatory security awareness training for all new employees upon onboarding to ensure they are equipped to identify and mitigate common cyber threats from the start, complementing the existing annual training program.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has a strong foundation with MFA implemented across critical access points and an annual security awareness program, the open MySQL port presents a critical technical vulnerability. Furthermore, the absence of security awareness training for new employees introduces a significant human element risk. Addressing these two key areas will substantially enhance the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and readiness against potential threats.</p>
