        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan identified an open SSH port (22) on an unspecified host, indicating a potential entry point. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is utilized for email and sensitive data systems, a critical gap exists as MFA is not required for computer logins. Furthermore, the organization lacks fundamental security practices, including an employee acceptable use policy and any form of security awareness training for both new and existing employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed SSH Service - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open port 22, typically used for SSH, was detected on a network host. If not properly secured with strong authentication, restricted access, and regular monitoring, this port can serve as a critical vector for unauthorized access, brute-force attacks, or exploitation of SSH vulnerabilities. The provided data indicates this as a critical risk.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with open port 22</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for employee computer logins. This significantly elevates the risk of unauthorized access to internal systems and data in the event of compromised credentials, making the organization highly susceptible to phishing, password spraying, and credential stuffing attacks.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Internal network access</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> There is no formal acceptable use policy (AUP) in place for employees. This lack of clear guidelines regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, internet access, and data handling can lead to inconsistent security practices, increased risk of data leakage, and potential legal or compliance issues due to employee misuse or negligence.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Organizational IT assets</li><li>Employee conduct</li><li>Data integrity</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees, nor does it provide annual training for all staff. This critical oversight leaves employees unprepared to identify and respond to common cyber threats such as phishing, social engineering, and malware, making them a primary target for attackers and increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network security</li><li>Incident response capability</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, immediate action is required. Firstly, the exposed SSH service on port 22 must be secured by implementing strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., key-based authentication), restricting access to trusted IP addresses, and ensuring regular patching and monitoring of the SSH server. Secondly, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) should be mandated for all computer logins to prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised. Thirdly, a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy must be developed, communicated, and enforced to establish clear guidelines for IT resource usage. Finally, a robust security awareness training program should be implemented, including mandatory training for all new hires and annual refresher courses for all employees, to educate staff on identifying and mitigating common cyber threats.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The current cybersecurity assessment reveals a mixed state of readiness. While some MFA is in place, the organization faces critical vulnerabilities stemming from an exposed SSH service, the absence of MFA for computer logins, and a significant lack of foundational security policies and employee training. These gaps collectively expose the organization to a high risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and operational disruption. Addressing these identified risks through the recommended actions is paramount to establishing a more resilient and secure environment.</p>
