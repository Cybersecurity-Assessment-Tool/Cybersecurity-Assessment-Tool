        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's current security posture reveals significant foundational weaknesses, primarily stemming from a lack of comprehensive security policies, employee training, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) implementation across critical systems. While MFA is used for email access, it is notably absent for computer logins and sensitive data systems, leaving these crucial access points vulnerable. Furthermore, the absence of an acceptable use policy and regular security awareness training for employees indicates a significant gap in human-centric security controls. A network scan was performed, which, despite showing port 80 as closed in the raw scan data, a specific vulnerability assessment identified an unencrypted web server potentially exposing sensitive data.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unencrypted Web Server - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Port 80 was identified as open, indicating the presence of an unencrypted web server. This allows for unencrypted communication, making any data transmitted over this port susceptible to eavesdropping and interception by malicious actors. This directly impacts the confidentiality and integrity of data, as sensitive information could be exposed during transit. The vulnerability was identified through a security assessment.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if employee credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or other means. Without a second factor, a stolen password is often sufficient for an attacker to gain access to internal systems, leading to potential data breaches, system compromise, and lateral movement within the network. This was identified through an organizational security policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee computer logins</li><li>Internal network access</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access sensitive data systems. This critical oversight means that if an attacker obtains a single set of credentials, they could gain direct access to the organization's most valuable and confidential information. The impact could include severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, reputational damage, and significant financial losses. This vulnerability was identified during an assessment of access controls for sensitive data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>Confidential file shares</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines on the appropriate use of company IT resources, employees may inadvertently engage in risky behaviors, such as visiting malicious websites, downloading unauthorized software, or mishandling sensitive information. This increases the likelihood of malware infections, data leakage, and compliance violations, as employees are not formally educated on expected conduct. This was identified through a review of organizational policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee workstations</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training. This means that individuals new to the organization may not be aware of common cyber threats, organizational security policies, or best practices for protecting company assets from day one. This significantly increases the risk of social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing), accidental data exposure, and other human-error-related incidents, as new hires are often targeted by attackers. This was identified through a review of employee onboarding procedures.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Email systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. Regular training is crucial to keep employees informed about evolving cyber threats, reinforce security best practices, and ensure compliance with policies. The absence of annual training leads to a decay in security knowledge, making employees more susceptible to sophisticated attacks like advanced phishing campaigns, ransomware, and social engineering, thereby increasing the overall risk of security incidents. This was identified through a review of ongoing employee development and compliance programs.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and access to sensitive data systems. For the unencrypted web server, the immediate action should be to close port 80 if it is not essential, or to implement SSL/TLS encryption to secure all web traffic. Furthermore, the organization must develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy, clearly outlining expectations for IT resource usage. Crucially, a robust security awareness training program should be established, including mandatory training for all new employees during onboarding and annual refresher training for all staff. These measures will significantly enhance the organization's defense against both technical vulnerabilities and human-centric security threats.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces a high level of cybersecurity risk due to critical gaps in foundational security practices and a specific network vulnerability. The absence of MFA for key access points, coupled with a lack of essential security policies and employee training, creates an environment highly susceptible to data breaches and system compromises. While some basic network hygiene is observed (e.g., port 80 closed in raw scan), the identified unencrypted web server vulnerability and the significant organizational weaknesses indicate a low state of readiness against modern cyber threats. Immediate and comprehensive action is required to address these deficiencies and build a more resilient security posture.</p>
