        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization currently employs Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access, which is a positive security measure. However, significant gaps exist in other critical areas. MFA is not enforced for computer logins or access to sensitive data systems, leaving these access points vulnerable to credential-based attacks. The absence of an employee acceptable use policy indicates a lack of formal guidelines for employee conduct regarding IT resources. While new employees receive security awareness training, annual training for all employees is not conducted, which can lead to a degradation of security posture over time as threats evolve. A specific vulnerability assessment identified an unencrypted web server on port 80, indicating a potential exposure point for unencrypted traffic.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unencrypted Web Server - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An unencrypted web server was identified, with port 80 reported as open. This exposes web traffic to potential eavesdropping and data interception, compromising the confidentiality and integrity of data exchanged with the server.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or malware. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's workstation.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Login systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Access to sensitive data systems does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). This poses a critical risk to the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive organizational data. If an attacker gains access to credentials for these systems, they can bypass single-factor authentication and access, exfiltrate, or tamper with critical information without an additional layer of security.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>File shares</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. This absence means there are no clear guidelines or expectations for employees regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, internet access, email, and data handling. This can lead to inconsistent security practices, increased risk of data breaches, and potential legal liabilities due to misuse or negligence.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>IT resources</li><li>Data handling procedures</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This oversight can lead to a decline in security posture over time as employees forget best practices, new threats emerge, and the organization's security landscape evolves. A lack of ongoing education increases susceptibility to social engineering attacks, phishing, and other human-factor vulnerabilities.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security culture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, the organization should prioritize the following actions: 1. Address the Unencrypted Web Server: Immediately investigate the reported unencrypted web server on port 80. If it is indeed active, either close the port if the service is not required, or implement SSL/TLS encryption to secure all web traffic. 2. Implement MFA for Computer Logins: Mandate Multi-Factor Authentication for all computer logins across the organization to enhance protection against credential theft. 3. Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems: Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication for access to all sensitive data systems as a critical step to protect high-value assets. 4. Develop and Enforce an Acceptable Use Policy: Create and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy that clearly defines expectations for IT resource usage, data handling, and security best practices, and ensure it is communicated to all employees. 5. Establish Annual Security Awareness Training: Implement a program for mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees, covering current threats, organizational policies, and best practices to maintain a strong security posture. 6. Conduct Regular Security Audits: Perform regular network scans and vulnerability assessments to proactively identify and address new or recurring vulnerabilities.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing MFA for email and providing initial security awareness training for new hires. However, the assessment reveals significant vulnerabilities, particularly concerning the lack of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, the absence of an acceptable use policy, and insufficient ongoing security awareness training. The identified unencrypted web server also presents a direct exposure risk. Addressing these critical gaps is paramount to enhancing the organization's overall security posture, protecting sensitive data, and reducing the likelihood and impact of potential cyberattacks. A proactive and comprehensive approach to implementing the recommended controls will significantly improve the organization's readiness against evolving cyber threats.</p>
