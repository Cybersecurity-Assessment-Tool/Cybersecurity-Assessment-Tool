        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization currently employs MFA for email access but lacks it for computer logins and sensitive data systems, indicating a significant gap in access control for critical internal resources. While an acceptable use policy is in place, there is no formal security awareness training for new or existing employees, leaving the organization vulnerable to human-factor risks. A network scan revealed an open SSH port (22), which, if not properly secured, could serve as an entry point for attackers.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Access Control (MFA for Computer Login) - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This means that if an attacker compromises a user's credentials (e.g., through phishing or credential stuffing), they can gain unauthorized access to internal systems and potentially move laterally within the network without needing a second verification factor. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee workstations</li><li>Internal network access points</li><li>Domain controllers</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Access Control (MFA for Sensitive Data Systems) - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access sensitive data systems. This critical security gap allows an attacker with compromised credentials to directly access and potentially exfiltrate highly confidential or proprietary information. The impact could range from severe data breaches and regulatory non-compliance to significant financial and reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Databases containing sensitive information</li><li>Critical business applications</li><li>File servers storing confidential documents</li><li>Cloud storage for sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or annually for all employees. This absence leaves the workforce susceptible to social engineering attacks such as phishing, malware, and other human-centric threats. Employees who are not trained on identifying and reporting suspicious activities are more likely to fall victim to attacks, serving as an unintentional entry point for adversaries.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li><li>Email systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed SSH Service - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A network scan identified an open SSH (Secure Shell) service on port 22. While SSH is a legitimate protocol for secure remote access, an exposed service without robust security measures (e.g., strong, unique passwords, key-based authentication, IP whitelisting, rate limiting, and regular patching) can be a target for brute-force attacks or exploitation of known vulnerabilities. Successful exploitation could grant an attacker remote command execution capabilities.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Network perimeter</li><li>Any server or device exposing port 22</li><li>SSH daemon configurations</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and, critically, for access to all sensitive data systems. This will create a robust layer of defense against credential theft. Furthermore, a comprehensive security awareness training program should be established, including mandatory training for all new hires and annual refreshers for all employees, to educate staff on identifying and mitigating common cyber threats like phishing and social engineering. The exposed SSH service should be immediately reviewed; access should be restricted to authorized IPs, key-based authentication should be enforced, and the service should be continuously monitored for suspicious activity and kept up-to-date with security patches.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant security vulnerabilities primarily due to inadequate access controls, specifically the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for computer logins and sensitive data systems, and a complete absence of security awareness training for its workforce. These gaps create substantial opportunities for attackers to gain unauthorized access through compromised credentials or social engineering. Additionally, an open SSH port presents a potential entry point if not rigorously secured. Addressing these critical areas through the recommended implementations is paramount to improving the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and protecting its assets from evolving threats.</p>
