        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a mixed security posture. While strong controls are in place for logging into computers and accessing sensitive data systems, including the use of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and consistent security awareness training for all employees, there are critical gaps in email security and policy enforcement. The network, as indicated by the provided organizational data, lacks a fundamental layer of protection for email access and a clear framework for employee conduct regarding IT resources.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing employee email accounts. This significantly elevates the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive communications and potential account takeover, even if primary credentials are stolen through phishing or other means. Compromised email accounts can be leveraged for business email compromise (BEC) attacks, data exfiltration, or to gain access to other linked services. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'Do you require MFA to access email?':'No'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee email accounts</li><li>Email servers/services</li><li>User credentials</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). Without a clear AUP, employees may not be fully aware of their responsibilities and the acceptable boundaries for using company IT resources, handling sensitive data, internet browsing, and software installations. This absence can lead to increased risks such as data leakage, malware infections from unapproved software or websites, non-compliance with industry regulations, and general misuse of company assets, creating a broad attack surface. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'Does your organization have an employee acceptable use policy?':'No'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT systems</li><li>Sensitive data</li><li>Network resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access across the entire organization. This will significantly enhance protection against credential theft and unauthorized access. Concurrently, the organization should develop and formally implement a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). This policy must clearly define expectations for IT resource usage, data handling, internet usage, and security responsibilities, and be communicated to all employees. Regular training sessions should be conducted to ensure all employees understand and adhere to the new AUP and the importance of MFA.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization has established a good foundation with MFA for critical system logins and consistent security awareness training. However, the absence of MFA for email access and a formal Acceptable Use Policy represents critical vulnerabilities that could be exploited, leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, and misuse of company resources. Addressing these specific gaps is paramount to significantly enhancing the overall security posture and reducing the organization's attack surface against common cyber threats.</p>
