        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network assessment revealed an active host with an identified unencrypted web server. A critical observation from the organizational data is the complete absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all key access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or provide annual training for all staff, despite having an employee acceptable use policy in place.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unencrypted Web Server - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An unencrypted web server is exposed, specifically on Port 80. This allows for unencrypted communication, making any data transmitted over this port vulnerable to interception and eavesdropping. The impact could be the compromise of sensitive information if transmitted over this channel. This was identified as Port 80 being open and serving content without encryption.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately close Port 80 if it is not essential, or redirect traffic to a secure, encrypted port (e.g., Port 443) utilizing SSL/TLS certificates for all web services. For long-term security, implement SSL/TLS encryption across all web servers. Additionally, the organization should prioritize the implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, to significantly enhance access control. Regular security awareness training for all employees, including new hires, is crucial to foster a security-conscious culture and educate staff on best practices and threat identification.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several significant security vulnerabilities, primarily an unencrypted web server and a widespread lack of Multi-Factor Authentication across critical systems. The absence of regular security awareness training further exacerbates these risks, leaving the organization susceptible to various cyber threats, including data breaches and unauthorized access. While an acceptable use policy is present, the technical and human-factor security controls require substantial improvement to achieve a robust security posture.</p>
