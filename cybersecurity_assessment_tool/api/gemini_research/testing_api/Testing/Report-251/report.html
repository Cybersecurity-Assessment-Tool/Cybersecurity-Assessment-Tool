        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan identified an open SSH port (22) on a host, indicating a potential entry point that requires robust security measures. Organizational data reveals significant gaps in foundational security practices, including a complete lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, there is no employee acceptable use policy, and new employees do not receive security awareness training, although annual training is provided for all existing staff. A critical localhost exposure was also noted from existing vulnerability data.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The system indicates a critical exposure of localhost, potentially allowing unauthorized access or exploitation of services running locally. This vulnerability was identified from the provided vulnerability data, highlighting a severe internal security flaw that could lead to system compromise or data exfiltration.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email if credentials are compromised through phishing, malware, or brute-force attacks, potentially leading to business email compromise, data exfiltration, or further internal network penetration. This was identified from the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email System</li><li>Employee Accounts</li><li>Authentication Processes</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for logging into organizational computers. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access through stolen or weak credentials, allowing attackers to gain a foothold within the internal network, escalate privileges, and access sensitive resources. This was identified from the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations</li><li>Servers</li><li>Employee Login Processes</li><li>Active Directory/Identity Management</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Access to sensitive data systems does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). This poses a critical risk, as a single compromised credential could grant an attacker direct access to confidential information, leading to severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and significant reputational damage. This was identified from the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive Data Systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>File Shares</li><li>Cloud Storage</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines, employees may engage in activities that introduce security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, mishandling company data, or using company resources for personal activities, leading to increased exposure to threats and potential legal liabilities. This was identified from the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All Employees</li><li>Organizational Culture</li><li>IT Systems</li><li>Data Handling Practices</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Incomplete Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees upon onboarding. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering attacks due to their unfamiliarity with organizational security protocols and common threats, increasing the risk of phishing, malware infections, and insider threats from day one. While annual training exists, the initial onboarding gap is significant. This was identified from the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New Employees</li><li>Onboarding Process</li><li>Organizational Security Posture</li><li>Human Resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed SSH Service - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An Nmap scan revealed that port 22, commonly used for SSH (Secure Shell), is open on a host within the network. While SSH is a secure protocol when properly configured, an open port represents an attack surface. Without robust hardening, strong authentication (e.g., key-based authentication, MFA), and strict access controls, this service could be vulnerable to brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or exploitation of SSH daemon vulnerabilities, potentially leading to remote code execution or unauthorized access. This was identified from the network scan data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with open port 22</li><li>SSH Service</li><li>Network Perimeter</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, the organization must prioritize the immediate implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, including email systems, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. This is a fundamental step to protect against credential compromise. Concurrently, a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy should be developed, communicated, and enforced to establish clear guidelines for secure behavior. Security awareness training must be expanded to include mandatory sessions for all new employees during their onboarding process, complementing the existing annual training. For the exposed SSH service, it is crucial to implement strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., SSH keys, disable password authentication, disable root login), restrict access to trusted IPs, and ensure the SSH daemon is regularly patched and configured securely. The critical localhost exposure requires immediate investigation and remediation to prevent internal exploitation.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity vulnerabilities, primarily stemming from a lack of foundational security controls such as Multi-Factor Authentication and comprehensive security policies. The absence of MFA across critical systems, coupled with an open SSH port and a critical localhost exposure, presents a high-risk environment susceptible to various attack vectors, including unauthorized access and data breaches. While annual security training is a positive step, the lack of initial training for new employees and an acceptable use policy leaves the organization vulnerable to human-factor risks. Immediate and decisive action is required to implement the recommended security enhancements and improve the overall security posture and readiness.</p>
