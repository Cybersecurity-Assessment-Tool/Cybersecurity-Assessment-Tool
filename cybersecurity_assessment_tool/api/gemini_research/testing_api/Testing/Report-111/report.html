        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes a MySQL database (version 5.7.33) on port 3306, which is open to the network. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required for email access, it is notably absent for computer logins and sensitive data systems, presenting significant authentication vulnerabilities. The organization has an acceptable use policy and conducts annual security awareness training for all employees, but new employees do not receive initial security awareness training, leaving a gap in foundational security education.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network, exposing the database service (MySQL 5.7.33). This direct exposure increases the risk of unauthorized access, brute-force attacks, or exploitation of known vulnerabilities in the MySQL server, potentially leading to data breaches or service disruption. This was identified via network scan data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li><li>MySQL Server 5.7.33</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are compromised (e.g., via phishing, keylogging, or brute-force attacks), as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication. This was identified through the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers</li><li>Login systems</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if user credentials are stolen or guessed, as there is no additional layer of security to verify user identity beyond a password. The impact could be a severe data breach, regulatory non-compliance, and reputational damage. This was identified through the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases containing sensitive information</li><li>File shares with restricted access</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees upon onboarding. This means new hires may not be immediately aware of common cybersecurity threats (e.g., phishing, social engineering), organizational security policies, or best practices, increasing the likelihood of human error-related security incidents from the start of their employment. This was identified through the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li><li>Internal network security</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted internal IP addresses or via a secure VPN. For long-term security, consider placing the database behind a VPN or within a more isolated network segment. Crucially, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) should be mandated for all computer logins and access to sensitive data systems to significantly enhance authentication security and prevent unauthorized access even if passwords are compromised. Furthermore, a comprehensive security awareness training program must be established for all new employees during their onboarding process to ensure they are equipped with essential cybersecurity knowledge and best practices from day one, complementing the existing annual training.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity vulnerabilities, primarily stemming from an exposed MySQL database, inconsistent implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for critical access points, and a gap in initial security awareness training for new employees. While some foundational security practices are in place, the absence of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, coupled with an open database port, represents critical weaknesses that could lead to unauthorized access and data breaches. Addressing these issues promptly is essential to improve the overall security posture and readiness against evolving cyber threats.</p>
