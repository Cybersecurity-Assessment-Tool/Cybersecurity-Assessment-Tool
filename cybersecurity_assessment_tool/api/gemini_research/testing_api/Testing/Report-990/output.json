                "Summary": "The organization's network scan indicates that no web server is openly accessible on port 80, as it is reported as closed. However, the organization exhibits several critical gaps in its security posture related to human factors and policy. Specifically, MFA is not required for computer logins, and there is a complete absence of an employee acceptable use policy and security awareness training for both new and existing employees. While MFA is used for email and sensitive data systems, the lack of it for computer logins and the absence of foundational security policies and training significantly increase the overall risk profile.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Unencrypted Web Server",
                        "Overview": "Port 80 is open, indicating a potential unencrypted web server. This allows for unencrypted data transmission, making any data exchanged over this port vulnerable to interception and eavesdropping. The impact is a compromise of data confidentiality. This was identified by detecting an open port 80 during a network scan.",

                        "Risk": "Inadequate Authentication for Computer Access",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication. The impact includes potential system compromise, data breaches, and lateral movement within the network. This was identified through organizational policy review.",

                        "Risk": "Undefined Employee Conduct & Security Policy",
                        "Overview": "The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy (AUP). Without an AUP, employees may be unaware of their responsibilities regarding company assets, data handling, and internet usage, leading to unintentional security breaches, misuse of resources, or non-compliance. The impact includes increased insider threat risk, legal liabilities, and inconsistent security practices. This was identified through organizational policy review.",

                        "Risk": "Untrained New Employees",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. This leaves new hires vulnerable to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) and unaware of critical security protocols, increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents. The impact is a higher risk of initial compromise and data breaches. This was identified through organizational policy review.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Outdated Security Awareness",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. This means employees may not be updated on the latest threats, best practices, or evolving company policies, leading to a degradation of security posture over time. The impact is a sustained higher risk of human-factor related security incidents. This was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "Organizational data and systems"

                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to enhance access security. A comprehensive employee acceptable use policy (AUP) should be developed and enforced to clearly define employee responsibilities and acceptable conduct regarding company resources and data. Furthermore, a robust security awareness training program must be established, including mandatory training for all new employees and annual refresher training for all existing staff to ensure continuous education on current threats and best practices. For the identified unencrypted web server risk, if port 80 is indeed open and serving content, it should either be closed if not needed or secured with SSL/TLS encryption (HTTPS) to protect data in transit. Regular network scans and policy reviews are also advised to proactively identify and address emerging vulnerabilities.",
            "Conclusion": "In conclusion, while the organization utilizes MFA for email and sensitive data systems, its overall cybersecurity readiness is significantly hampered by critical gaps in foundational security practices. The absence of MFA for computer logins, a formal acceptable use policy, and comprehensive security awareness training for both new and existing employees creates substantial vulnerabilities that could be exploited through human error or social engineering. Addressing these policy and training deficiencies, alongside securing any potentially unencrypted web services, is paramount to elevating the organization's security posture and reducing its exposure to common cyber threats."
