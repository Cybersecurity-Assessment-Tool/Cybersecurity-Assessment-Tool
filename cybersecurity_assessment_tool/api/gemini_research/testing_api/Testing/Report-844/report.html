        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan indicates no open ports, suggesting a basic level of external network security. However, internal security posture is significantly weakened by a lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA) for critical access points like email and computer logins, and an absence of fundamental security policies such as an employee acceptable use policy and security awareness training for new employees. While annual security awareness training is conducted, the initial onboarding and policy framework are insufficient.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require multi-factor authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. A compromised email account can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and further internal network penetration. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require multi-factor authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This leaves employee workstations vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are stolen or guessed. A compromised workstation can serve as an entry point for malware, ransomware, and lateral movement within the network, potentially leading to sensitive data breaches. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This policy defines the acceptable and unacceptable use of organizational IT resources, including computers, networks, and data. Without such a policy, employees may inadvertently or intentionally engage in activities that pose security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive data, leading to potential data breaches or system compromises. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All IT resources</li><li>Employee behavior</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering attacks due to their unfamiliarity with organizational security protocols and common threats. Without initial training, new employees are more susceptible to phishing, malware, and other attacks, increasing the overall risk of a security incident shortly after joining the organization. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>It is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and computer logins to significantly enhance credential security and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access. Furthermore, a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy must be developed and enforced to clearly define expectations for IT resource usage and reduce human-factor risks. Security awareness training should be integrated into the onboarding process for all new employees to ensure they are equipped with essential cybersecurity knowledge from day one. Regular, mandatory security awareness training for all employees should continue, with content updated to reflect current threat landscapes.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the external network appears to be well-protected with no open ports detected, the organization faces significant internal security vulnerabilities primarily due to a lack of robust multi-factor authentication implementation and critical policy gaps. The absence of MFA for email and computer logins, coupled with the lack of an acceptable use policy and initial security training for new hires, creates a high-risk environment. Addressing these fundamental weaknesses is paramount to improving the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and protecting against common attack vectors.</p>
