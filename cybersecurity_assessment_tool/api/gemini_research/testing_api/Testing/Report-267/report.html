        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an active MySQL database server (version 5.7.33) with port 3306 open. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for email and computer logins, it is notably absent for sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees, indicating gaps in both technical and policy-based security controls.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network. This exposes the database service to potential unauthorized access or exploitation, especially given the identified version MySQL 5.7.33, which may have known vulnerabilities if not regularly patched. The impact could range from data exfiltration to unauthorized data modification or denial of service. This was identified via an Nmap scan showing port 3306 in an open state.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted internal IP addresses or specific application servers. For a long-term solution, consider placing the database behind a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or within a more isolated network segment. Crucially, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be extended to all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised. The organization should also develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to define expected behavior and secure practices. Finally, establishing mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees will significantly enhance the human firewall against social engineering and other common threats.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In conclusion, the organization faces significant security risks primarily due to an exposed MySQL database service and critical gaps in its security posture related to sensitive data access controls, policy enforcement, and ongoing employee security education. While MFA is present for some systems, its absence for sensitive data, coupled with the lack of an acceptable use policy and annual security training, leaves the organization vulnerable to both external attacks and internal threats. Addressing these vulnerabilities through technical controls and policy implementation is paramount to improving overall cybersecurity readiness.</p>
