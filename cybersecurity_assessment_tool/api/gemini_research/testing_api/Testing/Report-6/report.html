        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan data indicates that no web server is currently accessible on port 80. However, an identified vulnerability points to an unencrypted web server being a risk. The organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins but lacks MFA for email and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, there is no employee acceptable use policy, and while new employees receive security awareness training, annual training for all employees is not conducted.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unencrypted Web Server - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Port 80 is identified as open, exposing potential unencrypted web traffic. This allows attackers to intercept sensitive information transmitted over the network, leading to data breaches or unauthorized access. The presence of an open, unencrypted web port was identified through a security assessment.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is recommended to immediately close port 80 if it is not intended for public access. If a web server is required, implement SSL/TLS encryption to secure all web traffic. Additionally, the organization should implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and sensitive data systems to significantly enhance access control and prevent unauthorized access. Developing and enforcing an employee acceptable use policy is crucial for setting clear guidelines on technology usage and promoting responsible behavior. Finally, establishing a program for annual security awareness training for all employees will help maintain a strong security posture and educate staff on evolving threats and best practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization exhibits a mixed security posture. While some foundational controls like MFA for computer logins and initial security awareness training are in place, significant gaps exist, particularly concerning MFA for email and sensitive data, the absence of an acceptable use policy, and a lack of recurring security awareness training. The identified unencrypted web server risk, if present, further highlights areas needing immediate attention to prevent data breaches and unauthorized access. Addressing these vulnerabilities and implementing the recommended controls will significantly improve the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and resilience against potential threats.</p>
