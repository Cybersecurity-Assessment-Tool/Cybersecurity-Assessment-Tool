        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's current security posture reveals several critical gaps in foundational security controls. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is not required for email access, computer logins, or sensitive data systems, significantly increasing the risk of unauthorized access through compromised credentials. Furthermore, the absence of an employee acceptable use policy indicates a lack of formal guidelines for secure behavior. While new employees receive security awareness training, the lack of annual training for all employees means the workforce may not be up-to-date on the latest threats and best practices. A specific risk identified is an 'Unencrypted Web Server' due to Port 80 being open, though network scan data indicates Port 80 is currently closed. This discrepancy requires further investigation to confirm the actual state of the port and the presence of an unencrypted web service.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unencrypted Web Server - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Port 80 is open, indicating the presence of an unencrypted web server. This allows for unencrypted communication, making it susceptible to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks where sensitive information could be intercepted. This risk was identified as a current vulnerability in the system.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. Developing and enforcing a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy is crucial for establishing clear guidelines for secure conduct. Additionally, annual security awareness training for all employees should be instituted to ensure ongoing education on evolving cyber threats and best practices. Regarding the 'Unencrypted Web Server' risk, it is imperative to verify the current status of Port 80. If it is indeed open and hosting a web service, it should either be closed if not essential or secured immediately by implementing SSL/TLS encryption to protect all data in transit. If the port is closed as per scan data, the risk should be re-evaluated and confirmed as mitigated.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant vulnerabilities primarily due to the absence of fundamental security controls such as multi-factor authentication and a formal acceptable use policy. While new employee training is a positive step, the lack of recurring security awareness training leaves the entire workforce susceptible to evolving threats. The identified 'Unencrypted Web Server' risk, if active, further compounds the exposure to data interception. Overall, the organization's readiness against common cyber threats is low, necessitating immediate action to implement the recommended security enhancements and verify the status of identified risks to build a more robust and resilient security framework.</p>
