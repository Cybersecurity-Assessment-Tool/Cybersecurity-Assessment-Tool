        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan identified at least one active host with port 22 (SSH) open. Organizational data indicates a significant lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA) across critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, there is no employee acceptable use policy in place. While security awareness training is conducted for new employees and annually for all staff, these foundational security controls are absent, creating substantial vulnerabilities. A critical vulnerability, 'Localhost Exposed,' has also been identified, indicating a service or system intended for internal use is accessible externally.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This critical risk indicates that a service or system intended for internal access only is currently exposed and accessible from external networks. This could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or system compromise if exploited. The impact is critical due to the potential for full system control or sensitive data exposure. It was identified as part of a vulnerability assessment.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The absence of MFA for email access, computer logins, and sensitive data systems significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access through compromised credentials. If an attacker obtains a user's password, they can gain full access to these critical resources without an additional layer of security. This vulnerability impacts the entire organization's data integrity and confidentiality.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email Systems</li><li>Computer Login Systems</li><li>Sensitive Data Systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Missing Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Without an acceptable use policy, employees may be unaware of their responsibilities regarding the use of company IT resources, leading to potential misuse, security breaches, or non-compliance. This lack of clear guidelines can expose the organization to legal, reputational, and operational risks, as well as increase the likelihood of insider threats or accidental data exposure.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All Employees</li><li>Organizational IT Resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port (22) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The presence of an open SSH port (22) on an active host, without specific context on its necessity or security controls, presents a potential attack vector. If not properly secured with strong authentication, rate limiting, and restricted access, this port can be exploited for brute-force attacks, unauthorized access, or remote code execution, leading to system compromise.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with Port 22 Open</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all email access, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. This will significantly enhance credential security. The critical 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability must be addressed by reviewing network configurations and firewall rules to ensure internal services are not externally accessible. The open SSH port (22) should be secured by implementing strong authentication (e.g., key-based authentication), restricting access to trusted IP addresses, and regularly patching the SSH server. Furthermore, the organization should develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to clearly define expectations for IT resource usage and reduce human-factor risks. Regular security audits and penetration testing are also advised to proactively identify and address emerging vulnerabilities.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several significant cybersecurity risks, including a critical 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability and a widespread lack of multi-factor authentication across key access points. While security awareness training is a positive step, the absence of fundamental controls like MFA and an acceptable use policy leaves the organization highly vulnerable to unauthorized access and data breaches. Immediate action is required to implement these foundational security measures and address the identified technical vulnerabilities to improve the overall security posture and readiness.</p>
