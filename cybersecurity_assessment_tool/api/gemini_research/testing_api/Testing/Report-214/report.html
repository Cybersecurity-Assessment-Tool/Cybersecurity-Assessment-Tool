        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Based on the provided organizational data, the organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and sensitive data systems, and has an acceptable use policy in place. However, there are significant gaps in email security and security awareness training, which pose considerable risks to the organization's overall security posture.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. Compromised email accounts can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and further network penetration. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on email access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li><li>Organizational data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, vishing) as they may be less familiar with organizational security policies, common threats, and reporting procedures. This lack of initial training exposes the organization to increased risk from human error and targeted attacks from day one. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for security awareness training for new employees.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network security</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. Regular, ongoing security awareness training is crucial to keep employees informed about evolving threats, reinforce best practices, and maintain a strong security culture. Without annual training, employees may forget previous guidance, become complacent, or be unaware of new attack vectors, increasing the likelihood of successful social engineering attacks and policy violations. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for annual security awareness training.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network security</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access to prevent unauthorized account compromise. Furthermore, a comprehensive security awareness training program should be established. This program must include mandatory training for all new employees upon onboarding to familiarize them with security policies and common threats. Additionally, annual refresher training should be provided to all employees to ensure they remain updated on the latest cybersecurity threats and best practices, fostering a continuous culture of security vigilance.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, and having an acceptable use policy. However, critical vulnerabilities exist concerning email security, specifically the absence of MFA, and a significant gap in security awareness training for both new and existing employees. Addressing these areas is paramount to mitigating the risk of human-factor attacks and unauthorized access, thereby improving the overall cybersecurity readiness of the organization.</p>
