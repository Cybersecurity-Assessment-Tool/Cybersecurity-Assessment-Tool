        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open SSH port (22) on a host, indicating a potential entry point for attackers. Furthermore, a review of organizational data highlights significant deficiencies in foundational security practices. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for email access or computer logins, leaving these critical access points vulnerable to credential-based attacks. While MFA is in place for sensitive data systems, the lack of it for everyday access significantly elevates risk. The organization also lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or provide annual training for all staff. These policy and training gaps create a high-risk environment for human error and unmanaged behavior.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH port (22) was identified on a network host. This port allows remote access to the system. Without proper security controls such as strong authentication (e.g., key-based), rate limiting, and up-to-date SSH server configurations, this can be exploited for unauthorized access, leading to data breaches or system compromise. The high CVSS score (10.0) indicates a critical impact.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with open port 22</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing, as a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to an employee's email, potentially leading to further internal network access or sensitive data exposure.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if passwords are stolen or weak, potentially allowing attackers to gain a foothold within the internal network, access local files, or deploy malware.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Internal network access</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This absence means there are no clear guidelines for employees regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, data handling, and internet usage. This can lead to increased risks of data leakage, malware infections, and non-compliance with regulations due to unmanaged employee behavior.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All IT systems</li><li>Employee behavior</li><li>Data security</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training. This means they are likely unaware of common cyber threats (e.g., phishing, social engineering), company security policies, and best practices from the start. This significantly increases the risk of human error leading to security incidents.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Overall organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. Without regular training, employees may forget best practices, fail to recognize evolving threats, and become complacent. This continuous lack of education weakens the human firewall and increases the likelihood of successful cyberattacks.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security culture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and computer logins immediately. For the open SSH port, implement robust security measures including disabling password authentication in favor of key-based authentication, configuring rate limiting, deploying intrusion prevention systems like Fail2Ban, and regularly patching the SSH server. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to guide appropriate conduct regarding IT resources. Furthermore, establish a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees and ensure annual refresher training for all staff to educate them on current threats and best practices. While MFA for sensitive data systems is a positive step, extending this critical control to other access points is paramount.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces a critical security posture due to an exposed SSH service and significant gaps in fundamental security controls. The absence of MFA for email and computer logins, coupled with a lack of essential security policies and employee training, creates a highly vulnerable environment. While some protective measures are in place for sensitive data, the overall readiness against common cyber threats is low. Immediate action on the recommended mitigations is crucial to enhance the organization's security posture and reduce the likelihood of a successful cyberattack.</p>
