        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network exhibits several critical security vulnerabilities despite some robust security practices. A network scan revealed an active FTP server running vsftpd 2.3.4 on port 21, which allows anonymous login. This version of vsftpd is significantly outdated and known to have critical vulnerabilities, including a backdoor. Furthermore, a significant portion of the workstations are still operating on Windows 7, an end-of-life operating system that no longer receives security updates, leaving them highly susceptible to modern threats. While the organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, and conducts annual security awareness training for all employees, a critical gap exists as new employees do not receive initial security awareness training. An acceptable use policy is in place.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Anonymous FTP Access and Outdated vsftpd - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nmap scan identified an FTP server (vsftpd 2.3.4) on port 21 that allows anonymous login. This poses a critical risk as unauthorized users can access, upload, or download files, potentially leading to data breaches, malware distribution, or system compromise. The service version (2.3.4) is also extremely old and known to have critical vulnerabilities, including a backdoor (CVE-2011-2523), making the server highly exploitable.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>FTP Server (vsftpd 2.3.4)</li><li>Port 21</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Windows Operating System - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization's workstations are running Windows 7, an operating system that has reached its end-of-life and no longer receives security updates from Microsoft. This exposes the systems to known and newly discovered vulnerabilities, making them highly susceptible to malware, exploits, and unauthorized access. Continued use of an unsupported OS significantly increases the attack surface and compliance risks.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations running Windows 7</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. This leaves new hires vulnerable to social engineering attacks (phishing, vishing, pretexting) and unaware of organizational security policies and best practices from day one. This significantly increases the risk of human error leading to security incidents and compromises the overall security posture.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediate action is required to address the critical vulnerabilities identified. The FTP server allowing anonymous access must be secured immediately by disabling anonymous login and either updating vsftpd to a current, supported version or decommissioning the service if it is not essential. All workstations running Windows 7 must be upgraded to a currently supported operating system (e.g., Windows 10 or 11) to ensure they receive vital security updates. Furthermore, a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees should be implemented to educate them on common threats and organizational security policies from their first day. The organization should continue its practice of requiring MFA for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, and maintain its annual security awareness training for all employees, reinforcing a strong security culture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a mixed security posture. While strong controls like MFA and annual security awareness training are in place, critical vulnerabilities such as an anonymously accessible and severely outdated FTP server, and the widespread use of end-of-life Windows 7 workstations, pose immediate and severe risks. The absence of initial security awareness training for new employees also represents a significant human factor vulnerability. Addressing these critical issues is paramount to improving the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and reducing its exposure to potential breaches and operational disruptions.</p>
