                "Summary": "The organization operates a network that includes an FTP server running vsftpd version 2.3.4, which was found to allow anonymous logins. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for computer logins and sensitive data systems, it is not required for email access. The organization conducts security awareness training for all employees, including new hires, at least once per year. However, there is no formal employee acceptable use policy in place. Furthermore, several workstations are still running the end-of-life Windows 7 operating system.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Anonymous FTP Access",
                        "Overview": "The FTP server (vsftpd 2.3.4) allows anonymous login, which can lead to unauthorized access to files, data leakage, or even server compromise if write permissions are misconfigured. This vulnerability was identified via the Nmap script 'ftp-anon'.",

                        "Risk": "Outdated FTP Software",
                        "Overview": "The FTP server is running vsftpd version 2.3.4, an old version released in 2011. This version is known to have several vulnerabilities, including a critical backdoor vulnerability (CVE-2011-2523) that allows remote code execution. Running outdated software significantly increases the risk of exploitation.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Email",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing, as a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to an employee's email.",
                        "Severity": "High",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Absence of Acceptable Use Policy",
                        "Overview": "The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This means there are no formal guidelines for employees regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, data handling, and internet usage. This can lead to increased risks of data leakage, malware infections, and non-compliance with regulations due to inappropriate employee behavior.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                    {
                        "Risk": "Outdated Windows Operating System",
                        "Overview": "Workstations are running Windows 7, an operating system that has reached its end-of-life and no longer receives security updates from Microsoft. This leaves systems vulnerable to newly discovered exploits and malware, significantly increasing the risk of compromise.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Workstations running Windows 7"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately disable anonymous access on the FTP server and update vsftpd to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities, including critical remote code execution flaws. Implementing MFA for email access is crucial to enhance account security and prevent unauthorized access. Developing and enforcing a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy will establish clear guidelines for IT resource usage and data handling, reducing insider risks. Finally, all workstations running Windows 7 must be upgraded to a currently supported operating system, such as Windows 10 or 11, to ensure they receive critical security updates and remain protected against modern threats. A long-term plan for hardware refresh may be necessary to support newer OS versions.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization faces several significant cybersecurity risks, primarily stemming from outdated software and operating systems, as well as critical configuration weaknesses like anonymous FTP access. The absence of MFA for email and a formal acceptable use policy further exacerbates the risk posture. While security awareness training is a positive step, these technical and policy gaps leave the organization vulnerable to data breaches, system compromises, and operational disruptions. Addressing these vulnerabilities promptly is essential to improve the overall security readiness and protect critical assets."
