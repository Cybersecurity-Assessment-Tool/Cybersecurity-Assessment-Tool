        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, and conducting annual security awareness training for all employees. An acceptable use policy is also in place. However, a network scan revealed an open SSH port (22), indicating a potential attack surface. Furthermore, critical gaps exist in security controls, specifically the lack of MFA for sensitive data systems and the absence of security awareness training for new employees, which could expose the organization to significant risks.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port (22) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An Nmap scan identified an open SSH port (22) on a host within the network. While SSH is a legitimate service for secure remote access, an open port represents an attack surface. If not properly secured with strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., key-based authentication, disabled root login, rate limiting) and regularly patched, it can be exploited for unauthorized access, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. The potential impact includes unauthorized system access, data exfiltration, or lateral movement within the network.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 22</li><li>SSH service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization's current security posture indicates that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if user credentials are compromised through phishing, malware, or other means. A single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to sensitive data, potentially leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and severe reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User authentication mechanisms</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct dedicated security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often unfamiliar with the organization's specific security policies, common attack vectors (such as phishing campaigns tailored to new employees), and best practices. This makes them particularly vulnerable to social engineering attacks, which can serve as an initial access vector for attackers, lead to malware infections, or result in the inadvertent disclosure of sensitive information. While annual training for all employees is beneficial, the initial onboarding period is a critical window for establishing a strong security culture.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li><li>Email systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement MFA for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised. The open SSH port (22) should be reviewed immediately; ensure it is necessary, and if so, secure it with strong authentication (e.g., SSH keys, disable password authentication), restrict access to trusted IPs, and implement intrusion detection/prevention systems. Additionally, a comprehensive security awareness training program for all new employees should be established to educate them on organizational security policies, common threats, and best practices from day one, complementing the existing annual training.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has implemented some essential security measures, such as MFA for email and computer logins, and annual security awareness training, significant vulnerabilities remain. The lack of MFA for sensitive data systems and the absence of security awareness training for new employees represent critical gaps that could be exploited by adversaries. Addressing these issues, along with securing the open SSH port, is crucial for enhancing the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and protecting its valuable assets.</p>
