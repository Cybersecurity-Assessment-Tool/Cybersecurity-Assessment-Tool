        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open port 8080 hosting an HTTP service titled 'TOP SECRET DB', indicating a critical exposure of a potentially sensitive database interface. While the organization has an acceptable use policy and conducts security awareness training for all employees, a significant gap exists in authentication practices. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for email access or computer logins, although it is mandated for sensitive data systems. This creates a substantial risk of unauthorized access through compromised credentials, further exacerbated by the direct exposure of a critical system.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed Sensitive Database Interface - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open port 8080 was identified, hosting an HTTP service with the title 'TOP SECRET DB'. This indicates a potentially sensitive database interface is directly exposed to the network, possibly without adequate authentication or access controls. Direct exposure of such systems can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and compromise of critical information. The presence of 'TOP SECRET DB' in the title suggests the system contains highly confidential data, making this a critical vulnerability.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li><li>HTTP service on port 8080</li><li>TOP SECRET DB interface</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing or credential stuffing attacks. If an attacker gains access to an employee's email, it can be used for further attacks, including password resets for other services or impersonation, potentially leading to broader system compromise.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee email accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This leaves employee workstations vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are stolen or guessed. Compromised workstations can serve as a pivot point for attackers to access internal networks and sensitive data, bypassing other security controls.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediate action is required to address the critical vulnerability on port 8080. The service should be thoroughly investigated, secured with strong authentication and authorization, and network access should be severely restricted or the service removed if not intended for external exposure. Furthermore, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and computer logins to significantly enhance protection against credential-based attacks. Regular network scans and penetration testing should be conducted to proactively identify and mitigate similar exposures.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security through its acceptable use policy and security awareness training programs. However, its current cybersecurity readiness is severely hampered by critical vulnerabilities. The direct exposure of a 'TOP SECRET DB' interface on port 8080 presents an immediate and severe data breach risk. Coupled with the absence of MFA for email and computer logins, the organization is highly susceptible to credential compromise and unauthorized access. Addressing these critical and high-severity risks is paramount to establishing a robust security posture and protecting sensitive assets.</p>
