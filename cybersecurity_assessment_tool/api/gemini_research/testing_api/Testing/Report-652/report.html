        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The network scan revealed no immediately apparent open ports, suggesting a basic level of external perimeter hardening. However, an assessment of the organization's security posture through a questionnaire identified several critical internal and human-factor vulnerabilities. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is used for email access, it is notably absent for computer logins and sensitive data systems, creating significant single points of failure. Furthermore, the organization lacks comprehensive security awareness training for both new and existing employees, leaving the workforce susceptible to social engineering and other human-centric attacks. An acceptable use policy is in place, which is a positive foundational element.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for computer login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Without multi-factor authentication (MFA) for computer logins, an attacker who obtains a user's password can gain unauthorized access to their workstation and potentially the internal network. This significantly increases the risk of credential theft, lateral movement, and data breaches. This was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Internal network access</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for sensitive data systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The absence of multi-factor authentication (MFA) for sensitive data systems means that a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to critical and confidential information. This poses a severe risk of data exfiltration, intellectual property theft, and regulatory non-compliance. This was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>Critical applications</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No security awareness training for new employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees are often unfamiliar with an organization's specific security policies, common attack vectors (like phishing), and best practices. Without initial security awareness training, they are more susceptible to social engineering attacks, leading to potential breaches, malware infections, or accidental data exposure. This was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network integrity</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No annual security awareness training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Regular security awareness training is crucial to keep all employees updated on evolving threats, reinforce security best practices, and maintain a strong security culture. The lack of annual training can lead to complacency, outdated knowledge regarding new attack techniques, and an increased likelihood of employees falling victim to social engineering or making security errors. This was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Overall security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and, critically, for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access even if passwords are compromised. Furthermore, a robust security awareness training program should be established, including mandatory training for all new employees upon onboarding and annual refresher training for all staff. This training should cover topics such as phishing, social engineering, password hygiene, and data handling best practices. Regular internal audits of access controls and user privileges should also be conducted.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently exhibits a mixed security posture. While external network exposure appears minimal based on the provided scan data, significant internal vulnerabilities exist due to the lack of MFA for critical access points (computer logins and sensitive data systems) and a complete absence of security awareness training for its workforce. These gaps represent substantial risks that could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and operational disruption. Addressing these fundamental security controls and investing in employee education is paramount to improving the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and resilience against modern threats.</p>
