        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The network scan identified at least one active host with an open SSH port (22). Review of organizational policies revealed several areas requiring attention. While the organization implements MFA for computer logins and provides security awareness training for new employees, there is a critical lack of MFA for email and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, annual security awareness training for all employees is not conducted, which can lead to a decline in security posture over time.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for email access. Email is a primary vector for phishing attacks and account compromise. Without MFA, a compromised password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's email, leading to further attacks (e.g., business email compromise, data exfiltration, credential harvesting). This was identified from the 'Org Data' indicating 'No' for MFA on email.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email systems</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if credentials are stolen or compromised. Attackers gaining access to these systems could lead to data breaches, regulatory fines, reputational damage, and operational disruption. This was identified from the 'Org Data' indicating 'No' for MFA on sensitive data systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>File shares</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Recurring Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual training for all employees. This leads to a degradation of security knowledge over time, making employees more susceptible to evolving threats like advanced phishing, social engineering, and malware. A lack of regular reinforcement can result in employees forgetting best practices, increasing the human element risk. This was identified from the 'Org Data' indicating 'No' for annual security awareness training.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port (Port 22) Exposure - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH port (22) was detected on an active host. While SSH is a legitimate service for remote administration, its exposure without proper hardening (e.g., strong, unique passwords, key-based authentication, rate limiting, IP whitelisting, regular patching) presents a potential attack surface. Attackers could attempt brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or exploit known vulnerabilities in the SSH daemon to gain unauthorized access. This was identified from the Nmap scan data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with open port 22</li><li>SSH service</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>It is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and sensitive data systems immediately to significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. For the identified open SSH port, ensure that strong authentication methods (e.g., key-based authentication), IP whitelisting, and regular patching are in place. Furthermore, establish a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees to continuously educate them on evolving cyber threats and best practices, reinforcing a strong security culture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant risks primarily due to the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for critical services like email and sensitive data systems, alongside an insufficient recurring security awareness training program. The presence of an open SSH port also warrants immediate review and hardening. Addressing these vulnerabilities is crucial for enhancing the overall cybersecurity readiness and protecting against common attack vectors.</p>
