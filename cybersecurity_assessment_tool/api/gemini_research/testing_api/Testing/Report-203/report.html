        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to cybersecurity through established employee acceptable use policies and regular security awareness training for all employees. However, critical vulnerabilities have been identified, particularly concerning authentication mechanisms and network exposure. An Nmap scan revealed an open SSH port (22), indicating a potential entry point for attackers. Furthermore, the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and sensitive data systems significantly elevates the risk of account compromise and data breaches. While MFA is required for computer logins, this does not extend to other critical access points, creating substantial security gaps.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A critical vulnerability where internal services or sensitive configurations are exposed externally, potentially allowing unauthorized access or data breaches. This was identified by a high CVSS score of 10.0, indicating maximum severity and ease of exploitation.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing or credential stuffing attacks, as a single compromised password could grant full access to an employee's email, leading to further internal compromise or data exfiltration.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email System</li><li>User Accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk, as unauthorized access to these systems could lead to severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and significant reputational damage if credentials are compromised, even if they are strong.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive Data Systems</li><li>User Accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An Nmap scan identified an open SSH (port 22) service. While SSH is a legitimate service, an open port represents an attack surface that could be exploited if not properly secured (e.g., weak credentials, unpatched vulnerabilities in the SSH daemon, or lack of rate limiting). This could lead to unauthorized remote access to the host.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Network Perimeter</li><li>Server with Port 22 Open</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediate action is required to mitigate the identified critical and high-severity risks. Firstly, thoroughly investigate and secure the 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability, ensuring no internal services or configurations are inadvertently accessible from external networks. Secondly, implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all email systems and sensitive data access points without delay. This is a fundamental security control that significantly reduces the risk of credential-based attacks. For the open SSH port, ensure that strong authentication methods (e.g., key-based authentication, disabling password authentication) are enforced, apply rate limiting, and keep the SSH daemon updated to the latest secure version. Leverage the existing employee acceptable use policy and security awareness training programs to reinforce the importance of strong passwords, MFA, and reporting suspicious activities. Consider expanding training to include specific threats related to email and sensitive data access.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has a commendable foundation in security awareness training and acceptable use policies, its current cybersecurity posture is significantly weakened by critical gaps in multi-factor authentication for key systems and an exposed network service. The absence of MFA for email and sensitive data systems, coupled with an open SSH port, presents easily exploitable vulnerabilities that could lead to severe data breaches and operational disruption. Addressing these high-priority risks immediately is paramount to enhancing the organization's overall security readiness and protecting its valuable assets.</p>
