        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization operates a web server running Nginx 1.18.0, accessible via HTTPS on port 443. From an organizational perspective, strong multi-factor authentication (MFA) is implemented for email access, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, indicating a robust approach to identity and access management. However, there are notable deficiencies in foundational security policies and ongoing employee security education.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Web Server Software - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nginx web server identified on port 443 is running version 1.18.0. This version, released in April 2020, is an older stable release and is known to be susceptible to various vulnerabilities that have since been patched in newer versions. Examples include CVE-2021-23017 (resolver stack buffer overflow) and CVE-2021-23019 (integer overflow). Exploitation of such vulnerabilities could lead to denial of service, information disclosure, or potentially remote code execution, compromising the web server and its hosted content. This was identified through network scanning.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Web server (Nginx 1.18.0)</li><li>Port 443 (HTTPS service)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). Without clear guidelines, employees may not fully understand their responsibilities concerning the use of company IT resources, data handling, and internet access. This increases the risk of misuse of company assets, accidental data breaches, introduction of malware, and non-compliance with regulatory requirements due to a lack of defined behavioral expectations. This was identified from organizational policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Organizational policy</li><li>Employee behavior</li><li>IT assets and data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Infrequent Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This gap means that existing staff may not be kept up-to-date on the latest cyber threats, evolving attack techniques (e.g., advanced phishing), and changes in organizational security policies and best practices. This significantly increases the likelihood of successful social engineering attacks and human error leading to security incidents. This was identified from organizational training data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee knowledge and behavior</li><li>Organizational security posture</li><li>Data integrity and confidentiality</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to immediately upgrade the Nginx web server to the latest stable version to address known vulnerabilities and ensure ongoing security. Furthermore, a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy should be developed and implemented to clearly define acceptable behavior regarding IT resource usage and data handling. Finally, establish a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees to ensure continuous education on current threats and best practices, thereby strengthening the human element of security.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a commendable commitment to identity and access management through widespread MFA implementation. However, critical vulnerabilities exist in the form of an outdated web server and significant gaps in foundational security policies and continuous employee training. Addressing these identified risks is paramount to reduce the overall attack surface, mitigate potential threats, and build a more resilient defense against the evolving landscape of cyber threats.</p>
