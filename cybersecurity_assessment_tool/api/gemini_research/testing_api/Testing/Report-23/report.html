        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization exhibits a commendable commitment to security awareness training for both new and existing employees, and has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins. However, a significant gap exists in the protection of sensitive data systems, as MFA is not required for access. Network scanning also identified an open SSH port (port 22), which, if not properly secured, could serve as an entry point for unauthorized access.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH port (port 22) was detected on a host within the network. While SSH is vital for remote administration, an exposed service without robust security measures (e.g., strong key-based authentication, disabled root login, IP restrictions, rate limiting) is susceptible to brute-force attacks or exploitation, potentially leading to unauthorized system access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 22</li><li>Network hosts with open SSH service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not mandate Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This omission significantly elevates the risk of unauthorized access to critical information. If primary credentials are compromised through phishing, malware, or other means, an attacker could gain full access to sensitive data without an additional layer of authentication.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>It is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all sensitive data systems to fortify protection against credential compromise. For the identified open SSH port, conduct a thorough review of its configuration. Ensure that strong authentication methods (e.g., key-based authentication) are enforced, root login is disabled, and access is restricted to trusted IP addresses only. Additionally, consider implementing rate limiting to mitigate brute-force attacks. Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments should be performed to continuously identify and address potential weaknesses.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has a solid foundation in security awareness and general MFA implementation, the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems and the presence of an open SSH port represent critical vulnerabilities. Addressing these specific risks is paramount to enhancing the overall security posture, protecting sensitive assets, and mitigating the potential for data breaches and unauthorized system access.</p>
