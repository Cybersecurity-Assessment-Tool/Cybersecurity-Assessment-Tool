        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes an RDP service on port 3389, which is a significant security concern. Furthermore, the organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access, computer logins, or sensitive data systems, significantly increasing the risk of unauthorized access. There is also no employee acceptable use policy in place. Positively, the organization does conduct security awareness training for both new and existing employees annually.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>RDP Exposure - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed on port 3389, allowing potential external access. This significantly increases the attack surface for brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, and exploitation of RDP vulnerabilities, potentially leading to unauthorized system access and control. This was identified via network port scanning.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP Address of the exposed RDP service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for accessing email, logging into computers, or accessing sensitive data systems. This leaves accounts vulnerable to compromise through stolen or weak credentials, as a single factor (password) is the sole barrier to access. The impact could range from email account takeover to unauthorized access to critical internal systems and data breaches. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email access</li><li>Computer logins</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy (AUP). Without a clear AUP, employees may not understand their responsibilities regarding company IT resources, data handling, and internet usage, increasing the risk of misuse, data leakage, and non-compliance with security best practices. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Data handling practices</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately close the exposed RDP port 3389 to the internet. For necessary remote access, implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) with strong authentication. Furthermore, implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, to significantly enhance credential security. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy (AUP) to clearly define expected behavior and responsibilities regarding IT asset usage and data handling. While security awareness training is already in place, consider incorporating specific modules on the importance of MFA and AUP compliance.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces critical security vulnerabilities, primarily due to an exposed RDP service and a widespread lack of Multi-Factor Authentication across key access points. The absence of an acceptable use policy further contributes to potential internal risks. While the organization demonstrates a positive commitment to security awareness training, these fundamental gaps in access control and policy enforcement leave it highly susceptible to external attacks and internal misuse. Addressing these issues promptly is crucial for improving the overall security posture and reducing the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access.</p>
