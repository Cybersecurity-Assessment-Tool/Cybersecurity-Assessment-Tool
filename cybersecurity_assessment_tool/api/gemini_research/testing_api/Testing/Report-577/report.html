        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes an Nginx web server (version 1.18.0) on port 443, indicating a public-facing web service. Internally, while Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is utilized for email access, it is notably absent for computer logins and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees, though new employees do receive initial training.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to internal systems if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or other means. Without a second factor, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's workstation and potentially the internal network. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Internal network access</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not enforced for accessing sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk, as compromised credentials could lead directly to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and significant financial and reputational damage. Protecting sensitive data requires robust authentication mechanisms beyond single-factor passwords. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>Cloud storage containing sensitive information</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Nginx Web Server - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nginx web server running on port 443 is version 1.18.0. This version is outdated and known to have several security vulnerabilities, including CVE-2021-23017 (Nginx resolver stack buffer overflow) which could lead to denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution. Running outdated software increases the attack surface and makes the server susceptible to known exploits. This was identified via network scan data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Nginx web server (version 1.18.0)</li><li>Public-facing web services</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not have an employee acceptable use policy in place. This lack of clear guidelines means employees may unknowingly engage in activities that pose security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling company data. Without a policy, it is difficult to enforce security best practices and hold employees accountable for their actions. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee behavior</li><li>Organizational data integrity</li><li>Network security</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, there is no annual training for all employees. Cybersecurity threats evolve rapidly, and without regular updates, employees may not be aware of new phishing techniques, social engineering tactics, or emerging malware. This significantly increases the risk of human error leading to security incidents. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li><li>Phishing susceptibility</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and, critically, for access to all sensitive data systems. The Nginx web server should be immediately upgraded to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities and improve overall security. Furthermore, the organization must develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to guide employee behavior and reduce internal security risks. Finally, a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees should be established to ensure continuous education on evolving cyber threats and best practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to a lack of robust authentication mechanisms for internal systems and sensitive data, an outdated public-facing web server, and gaps in foundational security policies and ongoing employee training. While MFA for email is a positive step, the absence of it for computer logins and sensitive data systems, coupled with an unpatched Nginx server, creates critical vulnerabilities. The lack of an acceptable use policy and annual security awareness training further weakens the human element of security. Addressing these areas is crucial for enhancing the organization's overall security posture and readiness against modern cyber threats.</p>
