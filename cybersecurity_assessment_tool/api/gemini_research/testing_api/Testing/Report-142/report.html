        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network security posture, based on provided organizational data, indicates several critical gaps in foundational security practices. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for computer logins, it is notably absent for email and sensitive data systems, leaving these crucial access points vulnerable. Furthermore, the organization lacks essential policy and training frameworks, specifically an employee acceptable use policy and regular security awareness training for both new and existing employees. These deficiencies suggest a low level of organizational readiness against common cyber threats, relying heavily on technical controls without adequate human and policy-based safeguards.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee inboxes if credentials are compromised through phishing, malware, or brute-force attacks. Email is often a primary vector for initial compromise and can lead to further internal network access, data exfiltration, or business email compromise (BEC) scams. This was identified through the organizational data indicating "Do you require MFA to access email?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email accounts</li><li>User credentials</li><li>Organizational communication</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not enforced for access to sensitive data systems. This exposes critical organizational data to a higher risk of unauthorized access. If an attacker obtains a user's single credential, they can potentially gain direct access to sensitive information, leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and significant reputational and financial damage. This was identified through the organizational data indicating "Do you require MFA to access sensitive data systems?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>Confidential information</li><li>User accounts with access to sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without a clear AUP, employees may not understand their responsibilities regarding the use of company IT resources, data handling, and internet usage. This can lead to risky behaviors, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive information, increasing the likelihood of security incidents and legal liabilities. This was identified through the organizational data indicating "Does your organization have an employee acceptable use policy?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Data handling practices</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training. This means that individuals new to the organization may not be aware of common cyber threats (e.g., phishing, social engineering), company security policies, or best practices for protecting organizational assets from day one. This significantly increases the risk of new hires inadvertently introducing vulnerabilities or falling victim to attacks. This was identified through the organizational data indicating "Does your organization do security awareness training for new employees?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li><li>Susceptibility to social engineering</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Annual Security Awareness Training for All Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. Regular training is crucial to keep employees informed about evolving threats, reinforce security best practices, and maintain a strong security culture. Without it, employees' knowledge of cybersecurity risks can become outdated, leading to a higher susceptibility to sophisticated attacks and a general degradation of the human firewall. This was identified through the organizational data indicating "Does your organization do security awareness training for all employees at least once per year?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security culture</li><li>Ongoing threat landscape</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, specifically for email systems and sensitive data systems, to prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised. Develop and enforce a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) to clearly define expected behaviors and responsibilities regarding IT resource usage and data handling. Furthermore, establish a robust security awareness training program that includes mandatory training for all new employees upon onboarding and annual refresher training for all staff to ensure continuous education on evolving threats and best practices. Regularly review and update these policies and training materials to adapt to the changing threat landscape.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently exhibits significant vulnerabilities primarily stemming from a lack of foundational security policies and practices. While MFA is used for computer logins, its absence for email and sensitive data systems, coupled with the lack of an acceptable use policy and comprehensive security awareness training, leaves the organization highly susceptible to various cyber threats, including phishing, data breaches, and insider risks. Addressing these gaps through the implementation of MFA for critical systems, establishing clear policies, and instituting regular security training is paramount to improving overall readiness and protecting organizational assets.</p>
