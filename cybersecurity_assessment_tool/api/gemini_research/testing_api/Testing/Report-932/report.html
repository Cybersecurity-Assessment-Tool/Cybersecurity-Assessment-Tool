        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open port 80, indicating a potential web server or service. Internally, the organization lacks multi-factor authentication (MFA) for critical access points including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, there is no established employee acceptable use policy. Positively, the organization does conduct security awareness training for both new and existing employees annually.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee inboxes if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. A single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to sensitive communications and potentially lead to further internal network penetration. This was identified from the organizational data indicating "Do you require MFA to access email?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li><li>Sensitive communications</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for employees to log into their computers. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if login credentials are stolen or guessed. An attacker gaining access to an employee's computer could potentially access internal resources, install malware, or escalate privileges within the network. This was identified from the organizational data indicating "Do you require MFA to log into computers?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Internal network access</li><li>Sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing systems containing sensitive data. This is a critical vulnerability as it means that a single compromised password could grant an attacker direct access to the organization's most valuable and confidential information, leading to data breaches, regulatory fines, and significant reputational damage. This was identified from the organizational data indicating "Do you require MFA to access sensitive data systems?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>Confidential information</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy (AUP). Without a clear AUP, employees may be unaware of their responsibilities regarding the use of company IT resources, data handling, and internet usage. This can lead to risky behaviors, unintentional data leaks, malware infections, and non-compliance with industry regulations, as there are no defined guidelines for secure conduct. This was identified from the organizational data indicating "Does your organization have an employee acceptable use policy?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>IT systems</li><li>Data security</li><li>Regulatory compliance</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open Port 80 (HTTP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A network scan identified an open port 80 (HTTP) on a host. While HTTP itself is not inherently a vulnerability, an open port 80 often indicates an unencrypted web service or a misconfigured redirect to HTTPS. If the service running on port 80 is not properly secured, patched, or configured, it could be susceptible to various web-based attacks, including information disclosure, cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, or denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Without further context, this represents a potential entry point for attackers. This was identified from the network scan data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with open port 80</li><li>Web server/service</li><li>Network perimeter</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, including email systems, computer logins, and especially sensitive data systems, to prevent unauthorized access from compromised credentials. Furthermore, the organization should promptly develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to clearly define expected behaviors and responsibilities regarding IT resource usage and data handling. The open port 80 identified during the network scan should be thoroughly investigated to determine the running service, ensure it is necessary, properly secured, patched, and ideally configured to redirect all traffic to HTTPS to encrypt communications and prevent eavesdropping or tampering. Regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing should also be conducted to proactively identify and address new risks.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant security vulnerabilities primarily due to the widespread absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, which leaves critical assets highly susceptible to credential-based attacks. The lack of an employee acceptable use policy also introduces a risk of human error and inconsistent security practices. While the organization demonstrates a positive commitment to security awareness training for all employees, these foundational gaps in access control and policy enforcement severely undermine its overall readiness against modern cyber threats. Addressing these core vulnerabilities is paramount to protecting sensitive data and maintaining operational integrity.</p>
