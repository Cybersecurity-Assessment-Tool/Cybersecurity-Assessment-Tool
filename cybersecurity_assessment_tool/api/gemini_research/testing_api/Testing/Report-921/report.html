        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The network scan identified an open port 8080 with a title 'TOP SECRET DB', which was subsequently confirmed to be a false positive and is secured. However, a review of organizational data revealed significant gaps in security posture, particularly concerning Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) implementation and regular security awareness training. The organization does not require MFA for email access or computer logins, creating critical entry points for attackers. Furthermore, annual security awareness training for all employees is not conducted, increasing susceptibility to social engineering and other threats. While an acceptable use policy is in place and new employees receive security training, these measures are insufficient to address the identified MFA and ongoing training deficiencies.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Without MFA, email accounts are highly susceptible to credential stuffing, phishing, and brute-force attacks. Compromised email accounts can lead to further internal network access, data exfiltration, and business email compromise (BEC) scams. This vulnerability was identified by reviewing organizational security policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>All employee email accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Not requiring MFA for computer logins significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to internal systems if credentials are stolen or guessed. This can lead to lateral movement within the network, data breaches, and system compromise. This vulnerability was identified by reviewing organizational security policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers</li><li>Network access points</li><li>Sensitive data systems (if accessible from these computers)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Lack of regular, annual security awareness training leaves employees vulnerable to evolving social engineering tactics, phishing, and malware. This increases the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents and compromises. This vulnerability was identified by reviewing organizational security policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Overall organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>It is strongly recommended that the organization implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and computer logins immediately. This critical step will significantly enhance protection against unauthorized access even if primary credentials are compromised. Additionally, a comprehensive annual security awareness training program should be established and mandated for all employees. This training should cover current threats such as phishing, social engineering, and malware, ensuring that the entire workforce is equipped to identify and respond to potential security risks. While the existing acceptable use policy and new employee training are positive, they must be supplemented with these crucial ongoing measures to build a robust security posture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant security vulnerabilities due to the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for email and computer logins, alongside a lack of annual security awareness training for all employees. While an initial network scan identified a potentially concerning open port, it was confirmed as a false positive. The primary risks stem from internal policy gaps that leave the organization susceptible to credential-based attacks and human error. Addressing these deficiencies is paramount to improving overall cybersecurity readiness and protecting sensitive assets.</p>
