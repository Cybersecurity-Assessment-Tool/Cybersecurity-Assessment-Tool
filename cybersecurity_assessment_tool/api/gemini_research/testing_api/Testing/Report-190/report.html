        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Based on the provided organizational data, the organization currently lacks critical multi-factor authentication (MFA) across key access points including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, there is an absence of a formal employee acceptable use policy and a deficiency in recurring annual security awareness training for all employees. While new employees receive initial training, the lack of ongoing education leaves the organization susceptible to evolving threats and human error. No technical network vulnerabilities were identified from the provided scan data.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee inboxes if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. A single compromised email account can lead to further internal network penetration, data exfiltration, or business email compromise (BEC) scams. This was identified by the 'Do you require MFA to access email?' response being 'No'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email accounts</li><li>Email server/service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce MFA for logging into computers. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if user credentials are stolen or guessed. Attackers gaining access to a computer can potentially move laterally within the network, install malware, or access sensitive local data. This was identified by the 'Do you require MFA to log into computers?' response being 'No'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Servers</li><li>Network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA to access systems containing sensitive data. This is a critical vulnerability as it means that a single compromised password could grant an attacker direct access to confidential information, intellectual property, or customer data. The impact could include data breaches, regulatory fines, reputational damage, and significant financial loss. This was identified by the 'Do you require MFA to access sensitive data systems?' response being 'No'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data repositories</li><li>Databases</li><li>CRM systems</li><li>ERP systems</li><li>File servers</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. Without an AUP, employees may be unaware of their responsibilities regarding the use of company IT resources, internet access, and data handling. This can lead to misuse of company assets, increased exposure to malware, data leakage, and non-compliance with industry regulations, as well as potential legal liabilities. This was identified by the 'Does your organization have an employee acceptable use policy?' response being 'No'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>IT systems</li><li>Network infrastructure</li><li>Data assets</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Recurring Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive initial security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. Cybersecurity threats evolve rapidly, and without regular updates and reinforcement, employees may become complacent or unaware of new attack vectors (e.g., advanced phishing techniques, social engineering). This increases the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents, such as clicking malicious links, falling for scams, or mishandling sensitive information. This was identified by the 'Does your organization do security awareness training for all employees at least once per year?' response being 'No'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network security</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, including email, computer logins, and especially sensitive data systems. This single measure will drastically reduce the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials. Concurrently, develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy (AUP) to clearly define expectations for IT resource usage and data handling. Furthermore, establish a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees, ensuring they are regularly updated on the latest threats and best practices to foster a strong security culture and minimize human-factor risks.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant security vulnerabilities primarily stemming from a lack of foundational security policies and controls. The absence of multi-factor authentication for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems presents critical entry points for attackers. Coupled with the lack of an acceptable use policy and insufficient recurring security awareness training, the organization's readiness against evolving cyber threats is low. Addressing these fundamental gaps is paramount to protecting organizational assets, sensitive data, and maintaining operational integrity.</p>
