        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open RDP port (3389) directly exposed to the internet, indicating a critical external vulnerability. Internally, the organization's security posture is weakened by the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and computer logins, despite requiring it for sensitive data systems. While an acceptable use policy is in place and new employees receive security awareness training, there is a significant gap in annual security awareness training for all employees, which could lead to a decline in overall security vigilance over time.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>RDP Exposure - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed directly to the internet via port 3389 (ms-wbt-server). This allows potential attackers to attempt brute-force attacks or exploit vulnerabilities in the RDP service to gain unauthorized access to internal systems, leading to potential data breaches, system compromise, or ransomware attacks. This was identified by an open port 3389 during the network scan.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3389 (ms-wbt-server)</li><li>External network perimeter</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks. A single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to an employee's email, which often contains sensitive information and can be used for further social engineering or internal network access. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on email.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee email accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This leaves computer systems vulnerable to unauthorized access if a user's password is compromised. Attackers could gain direct access to endpoints, potentially leading to lateral movement within the network, installation of malware, and data exfiltration. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on computer logins.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network endpoints</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Infrequent Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. While new employees receive initial training, the lack of regular, recurring training means employees may not be up-to-date on the latest threats, best practices, and organizational policies. This increases the risk of human-factor vulnerabilities such as falling victim to phishing, social engineering, or inadvertently introducing malware. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for annual security awareness training for all employees.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediately close port 3389 to external access to mitigate the critical RDP exposure. Implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) for secure remote access, ensuring all RDP connections are routed through the VPN with strong authentication. Furthermore, it is crucial to implement and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and computer logins to significantly reduce the risk of account compromise. Finally, establish a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees, covering topics such as phishing, social engineering, password hygiene, and incident reporting, to maintain a strong human firewall and keep the workforce informed about evolving threats.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization faces significant cybersecurity risks due to an exposed RDP service and a lack of comprehensive MFA implementation across critical access points like email and computer logins. While some foundational elements like an acceptable use policy and new employee training are present, the absence of annual security awareness training for all employees further exacerbates the overall risk posture. Addressing these vulnerabilities is critical to enhancing the organization's readiness against common attack vectors and protecting its assets.</p>
