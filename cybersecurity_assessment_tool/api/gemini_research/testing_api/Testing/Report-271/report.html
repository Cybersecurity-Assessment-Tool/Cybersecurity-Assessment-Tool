        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan identified an open SSH port (22) on a host, indicating a potential entry point that requires secure configuration. Organizational data reveals significant gaps in multi-factor authentication (MFA) implementation, with no MFA required for email access, computer logins, or sensitive data systems. While an acceptable use policy is in place and annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees, new employees do not receive immediate security awareness training upon onboarding, leaving them vulnerable during their initial period.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee inboxes if credentials are compromised through phishing, malware, or other means. A successful breach could lead to sensitive data exposure, business email compromise (BEC), or further internal network penetration. This was identified from the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email access systems</li><li>Employee email accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for logging into computers within the organization. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if user credentials are stolen or guessed. Attackers could gain direct access to internal systems, deploy malware, exfiltrate data, or move laterally across the network. This was identified from the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Server login interfaces</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Critical systems containing sensitive data are not protected by Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). Relying solely on passwords for access to these systems presents a severe risk. If credentials are compromised, attackers can gain direct access to the organization's most valuable and sensitive information, leading to major data breaches, regulatory fines, and reputational damage. This was identified from the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Databases containing sensitive data</li><li>File servers with confidential information</li><li>CRM/ERP systems</li><li>Cloud storage with sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port (22) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An Nmap scan identified an open SSH port (22) on a host within the network. While SSH is a secure protocol, an open port represents a potential attack surface. If not properly secured with strong authentication (e.g., key-based authentication, MFA), strict access controls (e.g., IP whitelisting), and kept patched, it can be vulnerable to brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or exploitation of SSH server vulnerabilities, leading to unauthorized remote access. The specific host details were not provided in the scan data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with open port 22</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not provide security awareness training for new employees upon onboarding. This means new hires may lack immediate understanding of critical security policies, best practices, and common threats like phishing and social engineering. This oversight increases the risk of human error leading to security incidents during their initial employment period. This was identified from the organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, immediate implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is strongly recommended across all critical access points, including email systems, computer logins, and especially sensitive data systems. For the identified open SSH port, it is crucial to review and harden its configuration by implementing strong authentication methods (e.g., SSH keys instead of passwords), restricting access to trusted IP addresses, and ensuring the SSH server software is regularly patched. Furthermore, a comprehensive security awareness training program should be established for all new employees, commencing on their first day, to ensure they are immediately equipped with the knowledge to identify and mitigate common cyber threats. Regular, engaging training for all employees should also continue to reinforce security best practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several significant cybersecurity risks, primarily due to the widespread absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for critical access points and an open SSH port that requires hardening. While an acceptable use policy and annual security awareness training are positive steps, the lack of immediate training for new employees creates an unnecessary vulnerability. Addressing these identified risks through robust MFA implementation, secure configuration management, and comprehensive onboarding security training is paramount to improving the organization's overall readiness against cyber threats and protecting its sensitive assets.</p>
