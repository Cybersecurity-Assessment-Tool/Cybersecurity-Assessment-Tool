        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a proactive stance in several key security areas, including mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, and consistent security awareness training for all employees. However, a critical gap exists in the application of MFA for sensitive data systems. Network scan data indicates that port 80 is closed, but a reported vulnerability suggests a potential issue with an unencrypted web server. Additionally, the organization currently lacks an employee acceptable use policy, which is a foundational element for establishing clear security expectations and responsibilities.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unencrypted Web Server - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This risk indicates the presence of a web server that may be configured to serve content over an unencrypted channel (HTTP, port 80). While the provided network scan shows port 80 as closed, the vulnerability report explicitly states 'Port 80 is open', suggesting a potential discrepancy or a finding from a different context. If port 80 is indeed open and unencrypted, it allows for the transmission of data in plain text, making it susceptible to eavesdropping and data interception by malicious actors. This could lead to exposure of sensitive information, session hijacking, or other data breaches. The risk was identified based on the vulnerability data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access. Furthermore, a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy should be developed and enforced to clearly define appropriate use of organizational assets and data. Regarding the 'Unencrypted Web Server' vulnerability, if port 80 is indeed open, it should be closed immediately. For any web services, the long-term solution involves migrating all traffic to HTTPS using SSL/TLS encryption to protect data in transit. Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments should be conducted to ensure ongoing compliance and identify new risks.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization exhibits a mixed security readiness profile. Strengths include robust MFA for email and computer access, and consistent security awareness training. However, the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems and a formal acceptable use policy represents significant vulnerabilities. The reported unencrypted web server, despite conflicting scan data, highlights a potential area of exposure. Addressing these identified gaps is crucial for bolstering the organization's overall cybersecurity resilience and protecting its valuable assets from potential threats.</p>
