        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Based on the network scan data, no open ports were identified on the target host, suggesting a potentially well-secured perimeter or a limited scope of the scan. However, an assessment of organizational security practices reveals several areas requiring attention to enhance overall readiness and internal security posture.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for employees to log into their computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised through phishing, malware, or brute-force attacks. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's workstation and potentially the internal network. This was identified from the organizational data indicating "Do you require MFA to log into computers?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Internal network</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk to data confidentiality and integrity. If an attacker gains access to credentials for these systems, they can directly access, exfiltrate, or tamper with sensitive information without an additional layer of security. This was identified from the organizational data indicating "Do you require MFA to access sensitive data systems?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>Cloud storage</li><li>Confidential information</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. While new employees receive training, the lack of recurring training means that employees may not be kept up-to-date on evolving threats, best practices, and organizational policies. This increases the likelihood of successful social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing), malware infections, and human error leading to security incidents. This was identified from the organizational data indicating "Does your organization do security awareness training for all employees at least once per year?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network security</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and, critically, for all sensitive data systems. This will significantly enhance protection against credential theft and unauthorized access. Furthermore, a comprehensive and mandatory annual security awareness training program should be established for all employees. This training should cover current threat landscapes, phishing recognition, data handling best practices, and organizational security policies to foster a strong security culture and reduce human-factor vulnerabilities. Regular updates to the acceptable use policy should also be communicated during these sessions.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the network perimeter appears to be robust with no open ports detected during the scan, the organization faces significant internal security vulnerabilities related to access control and employee awareness. The absence of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, coupled with a lack of annual security awareness training for all employees, creates substantial pathways for unauthorized access and data breaches. Addressing these foundational security gaps is crucial for improving the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and readiness against evolving threats.</p>
