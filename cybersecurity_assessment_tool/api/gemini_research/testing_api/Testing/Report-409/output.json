            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network currently exposes an Nginx web server (version 1.18.0) on port 443. This version is End-of-Life (EOL) and no longer receives security updates, posing a significant risk. Internally, the organization has critical gaps in its security posture, specifically lacking Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and sensitive data systems. While security awareness training for all employees is conducted annually, the absence of an employee acceptable use policy (AUP) indicates a lack of formal guidelines for employee conduct regarding IT resources. These factors collectively suggest a moderate to high-risk environment, particularly concerning external attack surface and internal credential compromise.",

                        "Risk": "Use of End-of-Life (EOL) Software",
                        "Overview": "Nginx version 1.18.0 is an End-of-Life (EOL) version, meaning it no longer receives security updates or bug fixes. Running EOL software exposes the organization to known and undiscovered vulnerabilities that will not be patched, making the server a prime target for attackers. This was identified via an Nmap scan showing port 443 running Nginx 1.18.0.",

                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. If an attacker gains access to an employee's email, it could lead to further internal network access, data exfiltration, or business email compromise (BEC) scams. This was identified from the organizational data.",

                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are compromised. A breach of these systems could lead to severe data loss, regulatory fines, reputational damage, and operational disruption. This was identified from the organizational data.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                    {
                        "Risk": "Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)",
                        "Overview": "The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy (AUP). Without a clear AUP, employees may engage in activities that inadvertently or intentionally introduce security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or misusing company resources. This can lead to malware infections, data leaks, and compliance violations. This was identified from the organizational data.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employee endpoints",
                            "Organizational network resources"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately upgrade the Nginx server to a currently supported and patched version to address the End-of-Life software vulnerability. Furthermore, implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and sensitive data systems to significantly enhance protection against unauthorized access and credential compromise. Finally, develop and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy (AUP) to establish clear guidelines for technology usage, ensuring employees understand their responsibilities in maintaining a secure environment. Regular reviews and updates of these policies should also be conducted.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to the use of End-of-Life software and critical gaps in authentication controls for email and sensitive data systems. While security awareness training is in place, the absence of an acceptable use policy further exacerbates potential internal risks. Addressing these vulnerabilities is crucial for improving the overall security posture and readiness against potential cyber threats."
