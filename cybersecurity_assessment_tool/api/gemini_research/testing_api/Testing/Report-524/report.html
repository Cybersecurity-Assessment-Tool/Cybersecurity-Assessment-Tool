        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to security through the widespread implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. An employee acceptable use policy is in place, and security awareness training is provided for new employees. However, a critical gap exists as annual security awareness training is not conducted for all employees. Network scans also revealed an open HTTP port (port 80) on a host, which could pose a risk if not adequately secured.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open HTTP Port - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open HTTP port (port 80) was identified on a host. This port is typically used for unencrypted web traffic. Without proper security measures (e.g., HTTPS redirection, Web Application Firewall), this can expose the organization to various web-based attacks, including data interception, injection attacks, and unencrypted credential transmission.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with open port 80</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. This significantly increases the risk of successful social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting), malware infections, and human error leading to data breaches or system compromise. Employees are often the first line of defense, and without regular training, their ability to identify and respond to threats diminishes.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization implements mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees to bolster their defense against social engineering and other threats. Furthermore, the open HTTP port (port 80) should be secured by implementing HTTPS with a proper certificate and configuring a permanent redirect from HTTP to HTTPS. Consideration should also be given to deploying a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect web services accessible via this port.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has established a solid foundation with MFA and initial security policies, the absence of regular, organization-wide security awareness training and the presence of an unsecured open HTTP port represent significant vulnerabilities. Addressing these areas is crucial for enhancing the overall security posture and reducing the likelihood of successful cyberattacks.</p>
