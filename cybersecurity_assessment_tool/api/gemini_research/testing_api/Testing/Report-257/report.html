        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a mixed security posture. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for email and sensitive data systems, a critical vulnerability exists with Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) exposed directly to the internet. Furthermore, there is a significant gap in internal access controls, as MFA is not required for computer logins. Foundational security practices are also lacking, with no employee acceptable use policy in place and an absence of annual security awareness training for all employees, indicating a potential for human-factor vulnerabilities and inconsistent security behavior across the organization.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>RDP Exposure to Internet - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed directly to the internet via an open port 3389. This significantly increases the attack surface, making the organization vulnerable to brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, and exploitation of RDP vulnerabilities, potentially leading to unauthorized access and system compromise. This was identified through network scanning data showing port 3389 as open.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3389</li><li>IP address of the host with RDP exposed</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Authentication for Computer Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This leaves employee workstations and potentially internal network access vulnerable to credential theft, phishing attacks, and brute-force attempts, as a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to internal systems. This was identified from the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on computer logins.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers</li><li>Internal network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines on appropriate use of company IT resources, employees may inadvertently engage in risky behaviors, such as visiting malicious websites, downloading unauthorized software, or mishandling sensitive data, increasing the likelihood of security incidents and making it difficult to enforce security standards. This was identified from the organizational data indicating 'No' for an acceptable use policy.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. This leads to a degradation of security knowledge over time, making employees more susceptible to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) and less aware of evolving cyber threats, thereby increasing human-factor risks and weakening the overall security posture. This was identified from the organizational data indicating 'No' for annual security awareness training.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately close the exposed RDP port (3389) to the internet. For necessary remote access, implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) with strong authentication, ideally including MFA, to secure the connection. Furthermore, implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to significantly enhance protection against credential theft. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to establish clear guidelines for IT resource usage. Finally, establish a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees to ensure continuous education on current cyber threats and best security practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces critical and high-severity vulnerabilities primarily due to an exposed RDP service and a lack of MFA for computer logins, which significantly broadens the attack surface. While MFA is present for email and sensitive data, the absence of an acceptable use policy and annual security awareness training indicates a need for improvement in foundational security policies and employee education. The organization's readiness is compromised by these gaps, requiring immediate attention to technical controls and a strategic investment in human-factor security measures to achieve a more robust and resilient cybersecurity posture.</p>
