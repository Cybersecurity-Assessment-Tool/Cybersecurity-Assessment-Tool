        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network analysis revealed a critical exposure: an open port 8080 hosting a service titled 'TOP SECRET DB'. This indicates a highly sensitive database is directly accessible, posing an immediate and severe data breach risk. Furthermore, the organization lacks fundamental security controls, specifically Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, significantly increasing the risk of unauthorized access through compromised credentials. The absence of an acceptable use policy also highlights a gap in governance regarding employee IT resource usage. While security awareness training is in place for new and existing employees, these critical technical and policy vulnerabilities severely undermine the organization's overall security posture.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed Sensitive Database - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Port 8080 is open and accessible, revealing a service titled 'TOP SECRET DB'. This indicates a potentially highly sensitive database is directly exposed to the network, possibly without adequate authentication or access controls. Unauthorized access could lead to severe data breaches, data manipulation, or complete system compromise. This vulnerability was identified via an Nmap scan showing port 8080 open with the 'http-title' script outputting 'TOP SECRET DB'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li><li>Service: TOP SECRET DB</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access, computer logins, or access to sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication. This was identified through organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA requirements across these critical access points.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email access</li><li>Computer logins</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This means there are no formal guidelines or rules for employees regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, data, and internet access. This can lead to misuse of resources, increased risk of malware infections, data leakage, and potential legal liabilities. This was identified through organizational data indicating 'No' for an employee acceptable use policy.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee IT resource usage</li><li>Data handling practices</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediate action is required to address the critical vulnerabilities identified. Firstly, the exposed service on port 8080, identified as 'TOP SECRET DB', must be secured immediately. This involves implementing strict firewall rules to restrict access to only authorized internal IP addresses or specific services, and a thorough review of the service itself to implement robust authentication, authorization, and encryption. Secondly, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be mandated and implemented across all critical access points, including email accounts, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, to significantly enhance protection against credential theft. Thirdly, a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy (AUP) should be developed, communicated, and enforced to provide clear guidelines for appropriate IT resource usage and mitigate risks associated with employee behavior. Regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing should also be integrated into the security program to proactively identify and remediate future vulnerabilities.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks, primarily stemming from a critically exposed sensitive database and a pervasive lack of Multi-Factor Authentication across key access points. The absence of an acceptable use policy further contributes to a weaker security posture by lacking formal guidelines for employee conduct. While security awareness training is a positive step, these fundamental technical and policy gaps represent severe vulnerabilities that require immediate and decisive action to improve the organization's overall security posture and readiness against potential cyber threats.</p>
