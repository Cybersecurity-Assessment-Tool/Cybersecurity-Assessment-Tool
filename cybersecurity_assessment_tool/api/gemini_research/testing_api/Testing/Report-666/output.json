            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization has implemented multi-factor authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins and conducts regular security awareness training for all employees. These are positive steps towards a robust security posture. However, critical gaps remain, including the lack of MFA for sensitive data systems and the absence of an employee acceptable use policy. A network scan identified a potential risk related to an unencrypted web server, indicating a need for secure data transmission protocols.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Unencrypted Web Server",
                        "Overview": "Port 80 was identified as potentially open or configured for unencrypted web traffic, posing a risk of sensitive data interception during transmission. This vulnerability was identified through a network scan.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Port 80"

                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems",
                        "Overview": "Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is not enforced for access to sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information should primary credentials be compromised. This was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Sensitive Data Systems"
                        ]

                    {
                        "Risk": "Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy",
                        "Overview": "The organization currently lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. This absence creates ambiguity regarding appropriate use of company assets, data, and networks, potentially leading to security incidents, data breaches, and compliance violations due to employee misconduct or negligence. This was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All Employees",
                            "Company Assets",
                            "Network Resources"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems immediately to prevent unauthorized access. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to clearly define expectations for technology usage and data handling, distributing it to all staff and requiring acknowledgment. For the unencrypted web server risk, ensure that all web services utilize HTTPS with valid SSL/TLS certificates, and that unencrypted port 80 is either closed or redirects traffic to HTTPS. Regular security audits and penetration testing should be conducted to proactively identify and address emerging vulnerabilities.",
            "Conclusion": "While the organization has established foundational security practices such as MFA for email and computer logins and regular security awareness training, significant vulnerabilities persist. The absence of MFA for sensitive data systems and a formal acceptable use policy represents critical gaps that could lead to data breaches and operational disruptions. Addressing these policy and technical deficiencies is crucial for enhancing the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and readiness against evolving threats."
