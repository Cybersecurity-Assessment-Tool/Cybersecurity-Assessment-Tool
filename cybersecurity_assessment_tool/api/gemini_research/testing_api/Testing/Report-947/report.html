        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open SSH port (22) on at least one host, indicating a potential entry point for attackers if not adequately secured. Furthermore, a review of organizational policies indicates a critical lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across key access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. While an acceptable use policy is in place and annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees, there is a notable absence of security awareness training for new employees, leaving them vulnerable during their initial period. These findings suggest significant vulnerabilities in access control and initial employee security posture.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An Nmap scan identified an open SSH port (22) on a network host. This poses a critical risk as it can be a target for brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or exploitation of SSH vulnerabilities, potentially leading to unauthorized remote access to the system. The severity is critical due to the direct remote access potential.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 22 (SSH)</li><li>Network hosts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently does not require MFA for accessing email, logging into computers, or accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of successful credential compromise, as a single stolen password could grant an attacker full access to critical organizational resources. This vulnerability was identified through a review of organizational security policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email systems</li><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate New Employee Security Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training as part of their onboarding process. While annual training is conducted for all employees, this initial gap leaves new hires susceptible to social engineering attacks, phishing, and unintentional security policy violations during their critical initial period. This was identified through a review of HR and security training policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement robust security measures for all open SSH ports, including enforcing strong, unique passwords, utilizing key-based authentication, disabling root login, and restricting access to trusted IP addresses. Furthermore, the organization must prioritize the implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, specifically for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, to significantly enhance credential security. Finally, a mandatory security awareness training program should be integrated into the onboarding process for all new employees to ensure they are equipped with essential security knowledge from day one. The existing acceptable use policy and annual security awareness training should be leveraged and reinforced to support these new initiatives.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The current cybersecurity posture of the organization presents several critical and high-severity risks, primarily stemming from an exposed SSH port and a pervasive lack of Multi-Factor Authentication across key systems. While foundational elements like an acceptable use policy and annual security training are present, the absence of initial security training for new employees further exacerbates the human element risk. Addressing these vulnerabilities, particularly the implementation of MFA and securing remote access points, is paramount to significantly improving the organization's readiness against common cyber threats and protecting sensitive assets.</p>
