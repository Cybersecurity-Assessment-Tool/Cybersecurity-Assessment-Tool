        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Based on the provided Nmap scan data, the network appears to have no open ports, suggesting a potentially hardened external perimeter or limited external exposure. This is a positive indicator for basic network security. Internally, the organization demonstrates good security practices by implementing MFA for email and sensitive data systems, as well as having an acceptable use policy and regular security awareness training. However, a key area of concern is the lack of MFA enforcement for computer logins, which presents a significant internal access risk.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised. Without MFA, a single factor (username/password) is sufficient for an attacker to gain access to an employee's workstation, potentially leading to lateral movement within the network, data exfiltration, or system compromise. This was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Internal network access</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risk, it is strongly recommended that the organization implements and enforces Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins. This will add an essential layer of security, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access even if primary credentials are compromised. Additionally, while the Nmap scan showed no open ports, regular, more comprehensive vulnerability scanning and penetration testing should be conducted to identify any hidden or internal network vulnerabilities. Continue with the established security awareness training and policy enforcement.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization exhibits a mixed state of cybersecurity readiness. While strong practices are in place for email, sensitive data access, and employee training, the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for computer logins represents a critical vulnerability that could be exploited for unauthorized internal access. Addressing this specific gap is paramount to enhancing the overall security posture and protecting against credential-based attacks.</p>
