        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization currently employs Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and computer logins, which is a positive security measure. However, a critical gap exists as MFA is not required for accessing sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization lacks fundamental security policies and training programs, specifically an employee acceptable use policy, initial security awareness training for new employees, and annual security awareness training for all staff. The network scan data provided indicates no open ports, suggesting a basic level of external network hardening, but this does not account for internal vulnerabilities or human-factor risks.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Sensitive data systems are not protected by Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). This means that if a single credential (e.g., a password) for an account with access to these systems is compromised, an attacker could gain unauthorized access to critical data without needing a second form of verification. This significantly elevates the risk of data breaches and unauthorized information disclosure, impacting data confidentiality and integrity. This vulnerability was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not have an established employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines on appropriate use of company resources, internet, email, and data handling, employees may inadvertently or intentionally engage in activities that introduce security risks. This can lead to increased exposure to malware, data leakage, compliance violations, and a general lack of accountability regarding cybersecurity best practices. This vulnerability was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li><li>IT assets</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training upon joining the organization. This leaves them unprepared for common cyber threats such as phishing, social engineering, and malware, as well as unfamiliar with the organization's specific security protocols and policies. Untrained new hires represent a significant entry point for attackers, increasing the likelihood of successful cyberattacks that could compromise systems or data. This vulnerability was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational systems</li><li>Sensitive data</li><li>Network access</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. Regular training is essential to keep staff informed about evolving cyber threats, new attack vectors, and updated security policies and best practices. Without ongoing education, employees' knowledge of security risks can degrade over time, making them more susceptible to sophisticated attacks and increasing the overall human risk factor within the organization. This vulnerability was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational systems</li><li>Sensitive data</li><li>Network access</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access from compromised credentials. Concurrently, develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy that clearly outlines expectations for secure behavior and resource utilization. Establish a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees during their onboarding process, covering essential topics like phishing, social engineering, password hygiene, and data handling. Furthermore, institute annual refresher security awareness training for all employees to ensure continuous education on evolving threats and best practices, reinforcing a strong security culture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has implemented MFA for email and computer logins, significant vulnerabilities exist due to the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems and a critical lack of foundational security policies and training programs. The current readiness against human-factor risks and internal threats is low, despite a seemingly hardened external network perimeter. Addressing these policy and training gaps is paramount to significantly enhance the overall cybersecurity posture and reduce the likelihood of successful cyberattacks and data breaches.</p>
