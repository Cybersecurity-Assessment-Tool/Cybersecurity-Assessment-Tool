        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization operates a network with at least one host running a web server on port 80. The organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems and has an acceptable use policy. New employees receive security awareness training. However, critical gaps exist in the security posture, specifically the lack of MFA for computer logins and the absence of annual security awareness training for all employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for employees to log into their computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication. This was identified from the 'Org Data' indicating 'Do you require MFA to log into computers?':'No'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Internal network access</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. This leaves employees vulnerable to evolving social engineering attacks (phishing, pretexting) and reduces their ability to identify and report security incidents, increasing the overall human risk factor. This was identified from the 'Org Data' indicating 'Does your organization do security awareness training for all employees at least once per year?':'No'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network security</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins. This will significantly enhance protection against credential theft and unauthorized access. Additionally, a comprehensive annual security awareness training program should be established for all employees to ensure they are continuously updated on current threats and best practices, thereby strengthening the human firewall. Regular vulnerability assessments of the web server on port 80 should also be conducted to identify and address potential software vulnerabilities.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security with MFA for critical systems and initial employee training. However, the absence of MFA for computer logins and annual security awareness training represents significant vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. Addressing these areas is crucial for improving the overall security readiness and resilience against common cyber threats.</p>
