            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network scan revealed at least one active host with SSH (port 22) open. From an organizational security standpoint, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for email and computer logins, and security awareness training is conducted for all employees, including new hires. However, a significant gap exists as MFA is not required for sensitive data systems, and there is no formal employee acceptable use policy in place.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Inadequate Access Control for Sensitive Data",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if primary credentials are compromised (e.g., via phishing, brute-force, or credential stuffing attacks). Without MFA, a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to sensitive data, leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and reputational damage. This was identified directly from the organizational security policy data.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Sensitive data systems",
                            "User accounts accessing sensitive data"

                    {
                        "Risk": "Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy",
                        "Overview": "The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy (AUP). An AUP is crucial for setting clear expectations regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, data, and networks. Without an AUP, employees may inadvertently or intentionally engage in activities that introduce security risks (e.g., installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, mishandling sensitive data, or using company resources for personal, non-work-related activities). This absence can lead to increased exposure to malware, data leakage, and legal liabilities. This was identified directly from the organizational policy data.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Open SSH Port Exposure",
                        "Overview": "The network scan identified an open SSH (port 22) service on at least one host. While SSH is a legitimate service, an exposed SSH port can be a target for brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or exploitation of unpatched SSH server vulnerabilities if not properly secured. Without further information on SSH configuration (e.g., use of strong passwords/keys, rate limiting, IP whitelisting, up-to-date software), it represents a potential entry point for attackers. This was identified via network scanning.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Host(s) with open port 22",
                            "SSH service"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access. Furthermore, develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy (AUP) to clearly define acceptable behavior and reduce human-factor risks. For the open SSH port, a thorough review and hardening of its configuration is essential, including ensuring strong authentication methods (e.g., SSH keys), disabling root login, implementing rate limiting, and keeping the SSH server software updated. Consider restricting SSH access to specific IP ranges where feasible.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security through MFA for email and computer logins and regular security awareness training. However, critical gaps exist, particularly the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems and a formal acceptable use policy, which expose the organization to significant risks. The open SSH port also warrants immediate review to ensure secure configuration. Addressing these vulnerabilities is crucial for enhancing the overall security posture and protecting sensitive assets."
