        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network appears to be minimally exposed externally based on the provided scan data, with no open ports identified. Internally, the organization has an acceptable use policy and conducts security awareness training for new employees. However, critical security controls such as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) are not universally enforced, specifically for email access and computer logins. Additionally, annual security awareness training for all employees is not consistently performed.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. If an attacker gains access to an employee's email, they could potentially impersonate the employee, access sensitive information, or launch further attacks within the organization. This was identified through the organizational data indicating "Do you require MFA to access email?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee email accounts</li><li>Email server/service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for employees to log into their computers. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials (username/password) are compromised. An attacker gaining access to a computer could then access internal resources, install malware, or move laterally within the network. This was identified through the organizational data indicating "Do you require MFA to log into computers?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee workstations/laptops</li><li>Domain controllers (if applicable)</li><li>Internal network</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Infrequent Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This leads to a degradation of security knowledge over time, making employees more susceptible to evolving social engineering tactics, phishing attempts, and other human-factor vulnerabilities. Regular training is crucial to maintain a strong security posture. This was identified through the organizational data indicating "Does your organization do security awareness training for all employees at least once per year?":"No".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network security</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and computer logins. This critical control will drastically reduce the risk of unauthorized access even if primary credentials are compromised. Furthermore, the organization should establish and enforce a policy for mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees. This will ensure that staff remain vigilant against current threats and understand their role in maintaining organizational security. Reviewing and updating the acceptable use policy regularly is also advised to reflect current best practices and technologies.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant risks due to the lack of universal Multi-Factor Authentication implementation for email and computer access, which are critical entry points for attackers. Additionally, the absence of regular, organization-wide security awareness training leaves the human element vulnerable to evolving threats. While some foundational policies are in place, these gaps in essential security controls and ongoing education indicate a moderate to high level of readiness risk. Addressing these vulnerabilities promptly through the recommended MFA deployment and consistent training will be crucial for improving the overall security posture and resilience against cyber threats.</p>
