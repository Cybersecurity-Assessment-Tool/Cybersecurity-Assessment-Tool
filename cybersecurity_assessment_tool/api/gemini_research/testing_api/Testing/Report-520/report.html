        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization exhibits significant vulnerabilities primarily stemming from a lack of foundational security practices, particularly in user authentication and security awareness. While MFA is required for email and sensitive data systems, its absence for computer logins creates a critical entry point for attackers. Furthermore, the complete lack of an employee acceptable use policy and any form of security awareness training (for new hires or annually for all staff) indicates a substantial gap in human-centric security controls. The provided network scan data is minimal and does not reveal specific network-level vulnerabilities, but the organizational data highlights critical weaknesses in policy and training that could lead to successful cyberattacks.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised through phishing, malware, or brute-force attacks. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's workstation and potentially the internal network, leading to data breaches, system compromise, or further lateral movement within the environment. This vulnerability was identified directly from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Internal network access points</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This means there are no formal guidelines or rules for how employees should use company IT resources, including computers, networks, and data. Without such a policy, employees may unknowingly engage in risky behaviors (e.g., installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, sharing sensitive data inappropriately), leading to security incidents, data breaches, or compliance violations. This vulnerability was identified directly from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All IT systems</li><li>Employee devices</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Compliance posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) as they may be less familiar with company policies, procedures, and common threats. Without initial training, new employees are more susceptible to falling victim to these attacks, potentially introducing malware, compromising credentials, or facilitating unauthorized access to the organization's systems, thereby increasing the overall attack surface. This vulnerability was identified directly from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employee accounts</li><li>Email systems</li><li>Internal network</li><li>Organizational data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. Regular training is crucial to keep employees informed about evolving threats, reinforce best practices, and maintain a strong security culture. Without annual training, employees may forget previous lessons, become complacent, or be unaware of new attack vectors, increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents, such as successful phishing attacks or malware infections. This vulnerability was identified directly from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee accounts</li><li>Email systems</li><li>Internal network</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Overall security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, the organization should prioritize the immediate implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to significantly enhance protection against credential theft. Concurrently, a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy must be developed and formally communicated to all staff, clearly outlining expectations for IT resource usage. Furthermore, a robust security awareness training program is essential; this should include mandatory training for all new employees upon onboarding and annual refresher training for all staff to ensure continuous education on evolving threats and best practices. These measures will collectively strengthen the organization's security posture by addressing critical gaps in authentication, policy, and human-centric defenses.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to a lack of fundamental security controls related to user authentication and employee awareness. The absence of MFA for computer logins, coupled with no acceptable use policy and a complete lack of security awareness training, leaves the organization highly susceptible to social engineering attacks, unauthorized access, and insider threats. While MFA is in place for email and sensitive data, these critical gaps indicate a low level of readiness against common cyber threats, necessitating urgent action to implement basic security hygiene and foster a more secure operational environment.</p>
