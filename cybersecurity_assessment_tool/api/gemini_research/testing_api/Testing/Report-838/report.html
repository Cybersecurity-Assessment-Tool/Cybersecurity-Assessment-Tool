        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a strong foundational security posture with comprehensive Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) implemented across email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. An employee acceptable use policy is in place, and security awareness training is conducted for new employees. However, there is a notable gap in recurring security awareness training for all employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. This oversight can lead to a degradation of security knowledge over time, making employees more susceptible to evolving threats such as phishing, social engineering, and malware. Without regular refreshers, employees may forget best practices, increasing the risk of human error leading to security incidents. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>It is strongly recommended that the organization implement mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees. This training should cover current threat landscapes, phishing recognition, data handling best practices, and incident reporting procedures. Regular training ensures that employees remain vigilant and informed about the latest cybersecurity threats and organizational policies, significantly reducing the risk of human-factor incidents.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization has established a commendable baseline for security readiness, particularly with its robust MFA implementation and initial employee training. However, the absence of annual security awareness training for all employees represents a significant procedural vulnerability. Addressing this gap is crucial for maintaining a resilient security posture and ensuring that the entire workforce remains a strong line of defense against evolving cyber threats.</p>
