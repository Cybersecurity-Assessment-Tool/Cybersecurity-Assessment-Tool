        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The network scan indicates a well-secured perimeter with no open ports detected, suggesting a robust firewall configuration. However, the organization's internal security posture is significantly weakened by the absence of fundamental security policies and training. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is commendably implemented for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, the lack of an acceptable use policy and any form of security awareness training for employees (new or annual) creates substantial human-factor vulnerabilities. This indicates a strong technical control for access but a critical gap in employee education and policy enforcement, which could lead to social engineering attacks, insider threats, or accidental data breaches.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The absence of an acceptable use policy (AUP) means employees may not be aware of the organization's expectations regarding the use of IT resources, data handling, and internet access. This can lead to misuse of company assets, exposure to malware, data leakage, and non-compliance with regulatory requirements. Without clear guidelines, employees might inadvertently engage in risky behaviors, impacting the organization's security posture and legal standing.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>IT systems</li><li>Sensitive data</li><li>Organizational reputation</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees are often targets for social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) as they may be less familiar with organizational security protocols and common threats. The lack of initial security awareness training leaves new hires vulnerable to these attacks, potentially compromising credentials, introducing malware, or facilitating unauthorized access to systems and data. This significantly increases the risk of a breach during the onboarding phase.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Email systems</li><li>Internal networks</li><li>Sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Annual Security Awareness Training for All Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Without regular, annual security awareness training, employees' knowledge of evolving cyber threats and best security practices can become outdated. This increases the likelihood of employees falling victim to sophisticated phishing campaigns, ransomware, or other social engineering tactics. Continuous training is crucial to reinforce security principles, adapt to new threats, and maintain a strong human firewall, preventing accidental or malicious security incidents.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Email systems</li><li>Internal networks</li><li>Sensitive data</li><li>Organizational reputation</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, the organization should immediately implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy, clearly outlining expectations for IT resource usage, data handling, and security protocols. This policy should be formally communicated to all employees and acknowledged. Furthermore, a mandatory security awareness training program must be established. This program should include initial training for all new employees during their onboarding process, covering essential topics like phishing recognition, password hygiene, data protection, and incident reporting. Additionally, annual refresher training should be conducted for all employees to keep them informed about the latest threats and reinforce security best practices. Regular training, coupled with the acceptable use policy, will significantly strengthen the organization's human firewall and reduce the likelihood of security incidents stemming from employee actions.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has commendably implemented Multi-Factor Authentication across critical access points, indicating a strong technical control for identity and access management, its overall cybersecurity readiness is severely hampered by significant gaps in foundational security policies and employee training. The absence of an acceptable use policy and any form of security awareness training for both new and existing employees creates a substantial human-factor vulnerability, leaving the organization susceptible to social engineering, accidental data breaches, and non-compliance issues. Addressing these policy and training deficiencies is paramount to building a robust and resilient security posture.</p>
