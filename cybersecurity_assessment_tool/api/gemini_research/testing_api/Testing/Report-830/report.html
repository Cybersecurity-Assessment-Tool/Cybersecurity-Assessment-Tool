        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network assessment reveals several critical and high-severity vulnerabilities. An Nmap scan identified an open FTP service (vsftpd 2.3.4) allowing anonymous login, posing a significant data exposure risk. Furthermore, a substantial portion of workstations are running Windows 7, an end-of-life operating system, leaving them highly susceptible to known exploits. Organizational policies show a lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, increasing the risk of account compromise. While MFA is used for sensitive data systems and annual security awareness training is conducted, there is no acceptable use policy and new employees do not receive initial security training, creating potential gaps in user behavior and awareness.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Anonymous FTP Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nmap scan identified an open FTP service (vsftpd 2.3.4) on port 21 that allows anonymous login. This configuration can lead to unauthorized access to files, data leakage, or even server compromise if write permissions are misconfigured. The service version is also outdated, potentially containing known vulnerabilities.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>FTP Server (vsftpd 2.3.4)</li><li>Port 21</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Windows Policy - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Computers are running Windows 7, which is an end-of-life operating system. This means it no longer receives security updates from Microsoft, leaving systems critically vulnerable to known and newly discovered exploits, making them easy targets for attackers.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing or brute-force attacks, as a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to an employee's email, potentially leading to business email compromise and data exfiltration.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This makes workstations vulnerable to unauthorized access if passwords are stolen or guessed, potentially leading to lateral movement within the network and access to internal resources.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This means there are no formal guidelines for employees regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, increasing the risk of misuse, data breaches, and non-compliance with security standards.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>IT resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training upon onboarding. This leaves them vulnerable to common social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) from the start, potentially exposing the organization to risks before they understand security best practices and their role in maintaining security.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately disable anonymous access to the FTP service, upgrade the vsftpd software to a current, supported version, and ensure it is securely configured. All workstations running Windows 7 must be upgraded to a currently supported operating system (e.g., Windows 10 or 11) to receive critical security updates. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and computer logins across the organization to significantly enhance account security. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to guide appropriate IT resource usage. Furthermore, establish mandatory security awareness training for all new employees as part of their onboarding process, in addition to the existing annual training, to ensure a consistent baseline of security knowledge.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks stemming from outdated software, insecure service configurations, and critical gaps in authentication policies and employee training. While some security measures are in place, such as MFA for sensitive data and annual security training, the absence of MFA for email and computer logins, the prevalence of Windows 7, and anonymous FTP access represent critical vulnerabilities that could lead to data breaches, system compromise, and operational disruption. Immediate and comprehensive action is required to address these findings and significantly improve the organization's overall security posture and readiness against cyber threats.</p>
