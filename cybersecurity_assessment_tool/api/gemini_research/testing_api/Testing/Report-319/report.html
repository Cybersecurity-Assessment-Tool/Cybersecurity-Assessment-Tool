        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open SSH port (22) on at least one host. While the organization has an acceptable use policy and conducts annual security awareness training for all employees, there are significant gaps in its security posture. Critically, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for accessing email, logging into computers, or accessing sensitive data systems. Furthermore, new employees do not receive security awareness training, leaving them vulnerable from the start.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Authentication Controls - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email, logging into computers, or accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or other means. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to critical systems and data, leading to data breaches, financial loss, and reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email systems</li><li>Employee computers</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed SSH Service - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A network scan identified that port 22 (SSH) is open on at least one host within the network. While SSH is a legitimate service for secure remote access, an open SSH port, especially if not properly secured with strong passwords, key-based authentication, rate limiting, and regular patching, presents a potential attack surface. Attackers frequently target SSH services with brute-force attacks or exploit known vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access. The scan data does not provide details on the security configuration of this service.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host(s) with open port 22</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate New Employee Security Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. This leaves new hires vulnerable to social engineering attacks, phishing attempts, and other common cybersecurity threats from day one. New employees may not be aware of organizational security policies, best practices for handling sensitive information, or how to identify and report suspicious activities, making them a weak link in the organization's security posture.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>Organizational data and systems accessible by new employees</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. For the exposed SSH service, ensure it is configured with strong, key-based authentication, disable password authentication, implement IP-based access restrictions, and regularly patch the SSH server software. Additionally, comprehensive security awareness training must be introduced for all new employees as part of their onboarding process to ensure they are equipped to identify and respond to cybersecurity threats from the outset. Regular reviews of security configurations and employee training effectiveness should also be conducted.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces critical vulnerabilities due to the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication across key systems and an exposed SSH service that could be exploited. The absence of security awareness training for new employees further exacerbates the risk of human-factor attacks. While some foundational elements like an acceptable use policy and annual training are in place, the organization's overall readiness is significantly hampered by these critical gaps, requiring immediate attention and remediation to prevent potential data breaches and unauthorized access.</p>
