        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's current security posture, based on the provided organizational data, highlights several critical areas for improvement in access control and policy enforcement. Specifically, the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems, along with the lack of an employee acceptable use policy and initial security awareness training for new hires, represents significant vulnerabilities. No technical network vulnerabilities were identified from the provided scan data, suggesting the primary risks are currently procedural and policy-based.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee inboxes through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks. A single compromised password could grant full access to sensitive communications and potentially lead to further internal system compromise. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on email.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email accounts</li><li>Email server/service</li><li>Employee credentials</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not enforced for accessing sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if a user's primary credentials are compromised. Attackers could gain direct access to sensitive information, leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and severe reputational damage. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on sensitive data systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases containing sensitive information</li><li>File shares with critical data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy (AUP). Without a clear AUP, employees may be unaware of their responsibilities regarding company assets, data handling, and internet usage. This absence creates a significant governance gap, potentially leading to misuse of resources, introduction of malware, data leakage, or other security incidents due to unguided employee behavior. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for an acceptable use policy.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company network</li><li>IT assets</li><li>Data handling procedures</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive dedicated security awareness training upon joining the organization. This means new hires may not be equipped with the necessary knowledge to identify and respond to common cyber threats (e.g., phishing, social engineering, malware) from day one. This makes them immediate potential targets and weak links in the security chain, increasing the risk of initial compromise. This was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for security awareness training for new employees.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Onboarding process</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is imperative to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all email accounts and sensitive data systems. This will provide a crucial layer of defense against credential compromise. Furthermore, develop and formally implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy (AUP) to clearly define expected behavior, responsibilities, and guidelines for using company resources and handling data. Concurrently, establish mandatory security awareness training for all new employees as an integral part of their onboarding process, ensuring they are equipped with essential cybersecurity knowledge from their first day. Continue the practice of annual security awareness training for all employees to reinforce best practices and keep staff informed of evolving threats.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by requiring MFA for computer logins and conducting annual security awareness training for existing employees. However, critical vulnerabilities exist due to the absence of MFA for email and sensitive data systems, the lack of an acceptable use policy, and the omission of security awareness training for new hires. Addressing these policy and access control deficiencies is paramount to mitigating significant risks, improving overall cybersecurity readiness, and safeguarding organizational assets against potential breaches and operational disruptions.</p>
