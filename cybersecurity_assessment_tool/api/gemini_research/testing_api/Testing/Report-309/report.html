        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization exhibits a mixed security posture. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for email and computer logins, a critical gap exists as MFA is not required for access to sensitive data systems. Furthermore, security awareness training is provided for new employees but is not conducted annually for all staff, indicating a potential decay in security knowledge over time. Network scans revealed an open port 8080 hosting a service titled 'TOP SECRET DB', which represents a significant and directly exposed risk to sensitive information.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed Sensitive Database Interface - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open port 8080 was identified, hosting a service with the title 'TOP SECRET DB'. This indicates a potentially sensitive database interface is directly accessible from the network, possibly without adequate authentication, encryption, or proper access controls. Direct exposure of such systems significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and system compromise, as attackers could potentially interact directly with critical data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li><li>Service on Port 8080</li><li>TOP SECRET DB interface</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive data systems. This leaves these critical systems vulnerable to credential stuffing, phishing attacks, and brute-force attacks, as a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to sensitive information without an additional layer of security verification.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User authentication mechanisms</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This lack of recurring training can lead to employees forgetting best practices, becoming susceptible to new social engineering techniques, and failing to recognize evolving cyber threats, thereby increasing the risk of human error-induced security incidents.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li><li>Training program</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediately investigate and secure the service exposed on port 8080, especially given its 'TOP SECRET DB' title. This should involve either closing the port if unnecessary, implementing robust authentication and encryption, or placing it behind a secure firewall with strict access controls. Furthermore, implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access from compromised credentials. Finally, establish a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees to ensure continuous education on current threats and best practices, reinforcing a strong security culture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization faces critical and high-severity risks primarily due to an exposed sensitive database interface and the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for sensitive data systems. While some foundational security practices like MFA for email/computers and new employee training are in place, the lack of comprehensive annual training and the direct exposure of a critical service indicate significant vulnerabilities. Addressing these issues promptly is crucial to enhancing the overall security posture and protecting sensitive assets.</p>
