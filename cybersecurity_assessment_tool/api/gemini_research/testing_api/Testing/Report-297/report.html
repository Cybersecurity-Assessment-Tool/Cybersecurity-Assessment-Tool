        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The network scan identified an open port 8080, which was initially flagged due to its 'TOP SECRET DB' title. However, further analysis confirmed this to be a false positive, and the port is considered secure. Organization-wide policies reveal a lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and computer logins, posing significant credential-based risks. While an acceptable use policy is in place and annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees, new employees do not receive initial security awareness training.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Port 8080 Open (False Positive) - <span class="severity-Info">Info</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Nmap scan identified port 8080 as open, running a service titled 'TOP SECRET DB'. However, further analysis, as per the provided current risks, indicates this is a false positive and the port is confirmed secure, posing no active threat.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing employee email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if an employee's credentials are compromised through phishing or other means, potentially leading to business email compromise, data exfiltration, and impersonation.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if local or domain credentials are stolen, potentially allowing attackers to gain a foothold within the internal network and move laterally.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network endpoints</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate New Employee Security Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. This means new hires may not be aware of common cybersecurity threats (e.g., phishing, social engineering) and best practices, making them more susceptible to attacks and potentially introducing vulnerabilities into the organization's security posture from day one.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>It is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and computer logins to significantly enhance credential security and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access. Furthermore, a mandatory security awareness training program should be developed and implemented for all new employees to ensure they are equipped with essential cybersecurity knowledge and best practices from their first day. Regular review and updates of existing security policies and training materials are also advised to address evolving threat landscapes effectively.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant risks primarily due to the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for critical access points like email and computer logins. While an identified open port 8080 was confirmed as a false positive, the lack of initial security awareness training for new employees also presents a notable vulnerability. Addressing these MFA and new employee training gaps is paramount to substantially improving the overall security posture and enhancing readiness against common cyber threats.</p>
