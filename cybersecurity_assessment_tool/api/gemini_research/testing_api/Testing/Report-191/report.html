        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan identified an open SSH port (22), which, if not properly secured, can pose a significant risk. From an organizational standpoint, while Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required for computer logins and annual security awareness training is conducted, critical gaps exist. MFA is not mandated for email access or sensitive data systems, leaving these crucial areas vulnerable. Furthermore, the absence of an employee acceptable use policy and a lack of security awareness training for new employees indicate a need for improved foundational security practices and user education.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unsecured SSH Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH port (22) was identified during the network scan. Without proper hardening, such as strong authentication (e.g., key-based), disabled root login, rate limiting, and up-to-date software, this port is susceptible to brute-force attacks or exploitation of known vulnerabilities, potentially leading to unauthorized system access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 22</li><li>Network perimeter</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly elevates the risk of email account compromise through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks. A compromised email account can lead to data breaches, business email compromise (BEC) scams, and unauthorized access to sensitive communications and systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access sensitive data systems. This critical oversight leaves valuable and sensitive information vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are stolen or compromised, increasing the likelihood of data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without formal guidelines, employees may unknowingly engage in risky behaviors, such as improper handling of company data, unauthorized software installations, or visiting malicious websites. This increases the risk of accidental data leaks, malware infections, and non-compliance with security best practices.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>IT systems</li><li>Organizational data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training upon onboarding. This leaves them unprepared for common cyber threats like phishing and social engineering from their first day, increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents, such as clicking malicious links or divulging sensitive information.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement robust security measures for the open SSH port, including strong authentication (e.g., key-based), disabling root login, and implementing rate limiting. Crucially, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) should be immediately deployed for all email accounts and sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access. The organization must develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to guide appropriate behavior regarding IT resources and data handling. Furthermore, a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees should be established to ensure they are equipped with essential cybersecurity knowledge from day one. Regular vulnerability assessments and a robust patch management program are also advised to maintain a strong security posture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently exhibits a mixed state of cybersecurity readiness. While some foundational controls like MFA for computer logins and annual security training are in place, significant vulnerabilities exist due to the lack of MFA for email and sensitive data systems, the absence of an acceptable use policy, and insufficient initial security training for new hires. The presence of an open SSH port also presents a potential entry point for attackers. Addressing these critical gaps is essential to enhance the organization's defense against common cyber threats and improve its overall security posture.</p>
