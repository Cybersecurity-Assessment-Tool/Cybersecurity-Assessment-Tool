        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes a MySQL database (version 5.7.33) on port 3306. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for email and computer logins, it is notably absent for sensitive data systems. Critical gaps in organizational security include the lack of an employee acceptable use policy and the absence of regular security awareness training for both new and existing employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network. This exposure allows external entities to potentially connect to the database, increasing the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, or denial-of-service attacks if the database is not properly secured with strong authentication and access controls. This was identified via an Nmap scan showing port 3306 as open.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is crucial to immediately implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from authorized internal IP addresses. For enhanced long-term security, consider placing the database behind a VPN or within a more isolated network segment, requiring authenticated VPN access for management. Furthermore, the organization must implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems. A comprehensive employee acceptable use policy should be developed and enforced, alongside a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees and annual refresher training for all staff to foster a security-conscious culture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In conclusion, the organization faces immediate risks from an exposed MySQL database and systemic vulnerabilities stemming from incomplete MFA implementation, a lack of an acceptable use policy, and the absence of regular security awareness training. Addressing these areas is paramount to improving the overall cybersecurity posture and readiness against potential breaches.</p>
