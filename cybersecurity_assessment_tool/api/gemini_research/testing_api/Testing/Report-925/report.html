        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems, and conducting regular security awareness training for all employees. However, a critical vulnerability was identified with an outdated Nginx web server (version 1.18.0) exposed on port 443, which is End-of-Life and no longer receives security updates. Additionally, the absence of MFA for computer logins and a formal employee acceptable use policy represent significant gaps in the organization's security posture, increasing the risk of unauthorized access and misuse of company resources.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Web Server Software (Nginx) - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nginx web server identified on port 443 is version 1.18.0, which reached End-of-Life (EOL) in May 2022. Running EOL software means it no longer receives security updates, making it highly susceptible to known vulnerabilities and exploits. This significantly increases the risk of compromise for the web service and potentially the underlying server, leading to data breaches, service disruption, or unauthorized access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Nginx 1.18.0 on port 443</li><li>Web server hosting Nginx</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This leaves user accounts vulnerable to credential stuffing, brute-force attacks, and phishing. If an attacker obtains a user's password, they can gain unauthorized access to internal systems without an additional layer of security, potentially leading to lateral movement within the network and data exfiltration.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee computer login systems</li><li>Internal network access</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. Without a clear AUP, employees may be unaware of the proper and secure use of company IT resources, including internet access, email, and hardware. This can lead to increased risks such as data leakage, malware infections from unauthorized software installations, and legal liabilities due to inappropriate online behavior, weakening the overall security culture.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Data integrity</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>It is strongly recommended to immediately upgrade the Nginx web server to a currently supported and patched version to mitigate the critical risk posed by outdated software. Implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins is crucial to enhance account security and prevent unauthorized access to internal systems. Furthermore, developing and enforcing a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy will clarify expectations for secure IT resource usage, reducing human-factor risks. Regular vulnerability scanning and patch management should be integrated into routine operations to proactively identify and address future security weaknesses.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has established a good foundation with MFA for sensitive systems and consistent security awareness training, significant vulnerabilities exist due to an outdated web server, lack of MFA for computer logins, and the absence of an acceptable use policy. Addressing these critical and high-severity risks is paramount to improving the overall security posture and readiness against modern cyber threats. Proactive measures and policy enforcement are essential to safeguard organizational assets and data.</p>
