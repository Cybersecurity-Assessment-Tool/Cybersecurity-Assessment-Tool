            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security through its implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, alongside regular security awareness training for all employees and an acceptable use policy. However, a critical gap exists in the protection of sensitive data systems, which currently lack MFA enforcement.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems",
                        "Overview": "The organization currently does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information should a single factor (e.g., password) be compromised. The impact could range from data breaches and regulatory non-compliance to reputational damage and financial losses. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational security policy questionnaire.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All sensitive data systems within the organization"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "It is strongly recommended that the organization implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems. This measure will significantly enhance the security posture by requiring an additional verification factor beyond a password, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised. Furthermore, regular reviews of access controls and data classification policies should be conducted to ensure that all sensitive data systems are appropriately identified and protected.",
            "Conclusion": "While the organization has established good practices in security awareness training and MFA for general access (email, computer logins), a critical vulnerability exists in the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems. Addressing this gap is paramount to safeguarding critical information and improving the overall cybersecurity readiness against sophisticated threats."
