        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to identity and access management, evidenced by the mandatory use of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and access to sensitive data systems. This significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials. However, the assessment identified critical gaps in foundational security practices related to human factors. Specifically, there is no formal employee acceptable use policy, and new employees do not receive dedicated security awareness training, although annual training is provided to all staff. The network scan did not identify any open ports or immediate network-level vulnerabilities, suggesting a basic level of network hardening.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Without a formal Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), employees may be unaware of the organization's expectations regarding the proper use of IT resources, data handling, and internet usage. This absence increases the risk of misuse, accidental data breaches, compliance violations, and potential legal liabilities. The lack of an AUP was identified through the organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational IT resources</li><li>Data integrity</li><li>Compliance posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees are often prime targets for social engineering attacks, such as phishing, as they may not yet be fully familiar with organizational security protocols, common threats, or reporting procedures. The absence of dedicated security awareness training during the onboarding process significantly increases the risk of successful attacks, potentially leading to credential compromise, malware infections, or data exfiltration. This vulnerability was identified by reviewing the organization's training practices.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational network</li><li>Sensitive data</li><li>Employee credentials</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization develop and implement a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). This policy should clearly outline expectations for IT resource usage, data handling, and security responsibilities, requiring all employees to acknowledge and adhere to it. Furthermore, a mandatory security awareness training program should be integrated into the onboarding process for all new hires, covering essential topics such as phishing, social engineering, password hygiene, and incident reporting. Regular review and updates of all security policies and training materials are also advised to adapt to evolving threat landscapes. While the initial network scan showed no immediate vulnerabilities, consider conducting more in-depth vulnerability assessments and penetration testing to uncover potential misconfigurations or software weaknesses that a basic port scan might miss.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization has established a strong foundation in identity and access management through robust MFA implementation. However, critical gaps in human-centric security controls, specifically the absence of an acceptable use policy and dedicated security awareness training for new employees, pose significant risks. Addressing these policy and training deficiencies is paramount to strengthening the overall security posture, reducing the likelihood of human error-induced incidents, and enhancing resilience against social engineering attacks. While the network appears hardened against basic external threats, continuous improvement in both technical and human security controls is essential for comprehensive protection.</p>
