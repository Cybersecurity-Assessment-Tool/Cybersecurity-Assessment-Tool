        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan identified an active host with an open SSH port (22). While the organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and conducts regular security awareness training for all employees, critical security gaps remain. Specifically, MFA is not required for accessing email or sensitive data systems, and there is a notable absence of an employee acceptable use policy. These deficiencies indicate a significant risk exposure, particularly concerning unauthorized access to critical information and potential policy violations.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A critical misconfiguration was identified where internal services, typically bound to localhost, appear to be accessible externally. This could allow unauthorized access to internal systems and data, bypassing perimeter defenses. The presence of an open SSH port (22) further exacerbates this risk, potentially allowing direct remote access if credentials are compromised or weak.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li><li>Port 22 (SSH)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing, as a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to an employee's email, leading to data breaches or business email compromise.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email System</li><li>User Accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not enforced for access to sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if user credentials are stolen or guessed, as there is no secondary layer of authentication to prevent access, posing a severe risk to data confidentiality and integrity.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive Data Systems</li><li>User Accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). Without clear guidelines on the appropriate use of company IT resources, employees may inadvertently engage in risky behaviors, such as visiting malicious websites, downloading unauthorized software, or mishandling sensitive information, increasing the overall attack surface and compliance risks.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Organizational Policy</li><li>Employee Behavior</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately address the 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability by ensuring that internal services are not externally accessible and that SSH access is properly secured, restricted, and monitored. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and sensitive data systems to significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials. Develop and enforce a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) to clearly define acceptable behavior regarding IT resource usage, thereby reducing human-factor risks. Regularly review and update security configurations, especially for publicly exposed services like SSH, to follow the principle of least privilege and secure defaults. Leverage existing security awareness training to educate employees on the importance of MFA and adherence to the new AUP.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several critical and high-severity vulnerabilities, primarily stemming from a misconfigured network service (localhost exposure) and significant gaps in access control policies (lack of MFA for email and sensitive data). While security awareness training is in place, the absence of an AUP and critical MFA requirements leaves the organization susceptible to credential-based attacks and insider threats. Addressing these issues promptly is crucial to enhancing the overall security posture and protecting sensitive assets from potential breaches and unauthorized access.</p>
