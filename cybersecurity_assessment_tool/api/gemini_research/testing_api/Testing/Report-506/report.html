        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to security fundamentals by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, robust security awareness training programs are in place for both new and existing employees on an annual basis. However, a critical vulnerability was identified with an FTP server (vsftpd 2.3.4) allowing anonymous login, posing a significant data exposure risk. Additionally, a substantial policy gap exists due to the absence of an employee acceptable use policy, which can lead to inconsistent security practices. Furthermore, several workstations are running outdated Windows 7 operating systems, which are no longer supported and highly vulnerable.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Anonymous FTP Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The network scan identified an FTP server (vsftpd 2.3.4) on port 21 that allows anonymous login. This poses a significant risk as unauthorized users could potentially upload or download files, leading to data breaches, malware distribution, or unauthorized access to sensitive information without authentication.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>FTP Server (vsftpd 2.3.4)</li><li>Port 21</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. This absence can lead to inconsistent employee behavior regarding IT resource usage, potential misuse of company assets, and an increased risk of security incidents due to a lack of clear guidelines on acceptable and unacceptable activities, data handling, and system access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Organizational Policy</li><li>Employees</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Windows Operating Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Several computers within the organization are running Windows 7. This operating system has reached its end-of-life and no longer receives critical security updates from Microsoft. This exposes workstations to known and unpatched vulnerabilities, making them highly susceptible to malware, exploits, and other cyberattacks, potentially leading to system compromise and data loss.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations (running Windows 7)</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately disable anonymous FTP access on the vsftpd server. If FTP functionality is essential, consider implementing secure alternatives like SFTP or SCP, or restrict access to authenticated users and specific, non-sensitive directories. Concurrently, the organization must prioritize the development and implementation of a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy, ensuring all employees are trained on its terms and acknowledge compliance. Furthermore, a critical priority is to upgrade all workstations running Windows 7 to a currently supported operating system (e.g., Windows 10 or 11) to ensure they receive vital security updates and patches. A robust patch management strategy should be established for all systems. The organization should continue its strong practices of utilizing MFA and conducting regular security awareness training.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization demonstrates a commendable commitment to foundational security practices through MFA implementation and regular security awareness training, significant vulnerabilities exist that require immediate attention. The presence of an anonymous FTP server, the lack of an acceptable use policy, and the continued use of outdated Windows 7 operating systems represent critical security gaps. Addressing these issues promptly is essential to enhance the organization's overall security posture and reduce its susceptibility to cyber threats and data breaches.</p>
