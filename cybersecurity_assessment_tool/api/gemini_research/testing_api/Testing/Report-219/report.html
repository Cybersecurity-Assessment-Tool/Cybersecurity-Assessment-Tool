        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes a MySQL database on port 3306, running version 5.7.33. While the organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, it lacks MFA for access to sensitive data systems. Positive security practices include an employee acceptable use policy and regular security awareness training for all employees, including new hires.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is openly accessible on the network, exposing a MySQL 5.7.33 database. This direct exposure significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and potential exploitation of known vulnerabilities in the specific MySQL version. This was identified via network port scanning.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li><li>MySQL Server 5.7.33</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive data systems. This significantly weakens the security posture, as compromised credentials (e.g., through phishing or malware) could grant attackers direct access to critical data without an additional layer of authentication. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User authentication mechanisms</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement strict firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from authorized internal systems. For long-term security, consider placing the database behind a VPN or within a more secure network segment, accessible only by authorized applications and personnel, and ensure the MySQL server is regularly patched and updated. Furthermore, implement and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication for all sensitive data systems to add a crucial layer of security, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access even if primary credentials are compromised.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security through its use of MFA for email and computer logins, as well as robust security awareness training and an acceptable use policy. However, critical vulnerabilities exist, notably an exposed MySQL database and the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems. These gaps present significant risks for data breaches and unauthorized access, requiring immediate attention to bolster the overall security posture and ensure the protection of sensitive information.</p>
