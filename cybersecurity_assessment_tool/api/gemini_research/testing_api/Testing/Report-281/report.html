        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) on port 3389, indicating a direct attack surface to the internet. Furthermore, the organizational security posture is significantly weakened by the absence of multi-factor authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins. Critical security practices such as an employee acceptable use policy and regular security awareness training for all employees are also not in place. While MFA is utilized for sensitive data systems, the overall lack of fundamental security controls presents a high risk profile.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>RDP Exposure - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed to the internet on port 3389. This allows external attackers to attempt to brute-force RDP credentials or exploit vulnerabilities in the RDP service, potentially leading to unauthorized access to internal systems. This was identified through a network scan showing port 3389 open and the 'ms-wbt-server' service running.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP address with open port 3389</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately close port 3389 to external access. For necessary remote access, implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution that requires strong authentication, preferably multi-factor authentication (MFA), before allowing access to internal resources, including RDP. Furthermore, implement MFA for all email access and computer logins to significantly reduce the risk of credential theft. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy. Establish and conduct mandatory security awareness training for all new employees and annual refresher training for all staff to educate them on common threats and secure practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces critical security vulnerabilities, primarily due to an exposed RDP service and a significant lack of foundational security controls. The absence of MFA for key access points, an acceptable use policy, and regular security awareness training leaves the organization highly susceptible to various cyberattacks, including unauthorized access, data breaches, and ransomware. While MFA is used for sensitive data systems, the overall security readiness is low, requiring immediate and comprehensive action to mitigate identified risks and build a more robust security posture.</p>
