        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes a MySQL database on port 3306. While the organization has an acceptable use policy and conducts regular security awareness training for all employees, it lacks multi-factor authentication (MFA) for email access and computer logins, although MFA is used for sensitive data systems.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network. This exposes the database to potential unauthorized access, data breaches, and service disruption. It was identified through a network port scan revealing an open MySQL service.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing or credential stuffing attacks, as a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to an employee's email. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This makes endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if passwords are stolen or guessed, potentially leading to lateral movement within the network and data exfiltration. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>It is strongly recommended to immediately implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted internal IP addresses or specific application servers. For a long-term solution, consider placing the database behind a VPN or implementing a secure bastion host for administrative access. Crucially, the organization must implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and computer logins to significantly enhance protection against credential-based attacks. While MFA is in place for sensitive data systems, extending it to email and endpoints will close critical security gaps. Continue with regular security awareness training, emphasizing the importance of strong passwords and phishing recognition.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security through acceptable use policies and regular security awareness training. However, critical vulnerabilities exist, including an exposed MySQL database and a significant lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins. Addressing these gaps is paramount to improving the overall security posture and reducing the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access.</p>
