        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The provided network scan data indicates a minimal network footprint with no open ports identified on the scanned hosts, suggesting a potentially well-hardened perimeter or an incomplete scan. However, a review of organizational security practices reveals several critical areas requiring attention to enhance overall readiness.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or other means. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to sensitive data, leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. This leaves new hires vulnerable to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) and increases the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents. New employees may not be aware of organizational security policies, common threat vectors, or best practices for handling sensitive information, making them a potential weak link in the security chain.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization implements mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised. Additionally, a comprehensive security awareness training program must be established for all new employees as part of their onboarding process to educate them on common threats, organizational policies, and best practices. Regular review and updates of security policies and training materials should also be conducted.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the network scan data did not reveal immediate technical vulnerabilities, the organization's current security posture is compromised by significant gaps in access control for sensitive data and a lack of initial security awareness training for new employees. Addressing these human and access control vulnerabilities is crucial for improving overall readiness and mitigating the risk of data breaches and social engineering attacks.</p>
