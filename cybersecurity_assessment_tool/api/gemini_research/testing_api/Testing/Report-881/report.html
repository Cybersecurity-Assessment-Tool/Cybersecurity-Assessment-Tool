        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) on port 3389, which is a critical security vulnerability. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for email and sensitive data systems, it is notably absent for computer logins, creating a significant access control weakness. Furthermore, the organization lacks a comprehensive security awareness training program for both new and existing employees, increasing susceptibility to social engineering attacks. An acceptable use policy is in place.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>RDP Exposure - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed to the internet, meaning port 3389 is open and accessible from outside the internal network. This allows potential attackers to attempt brute-force attacks, exploit known RDP vulnerabilities, or leverage stolen credentials to gain unauthorized access to internal systems. The impact could range from full system compromise, data exfiltration, ransomware deployment, to establishing a persistent foothold within the network. This vulnerability was identified through a network scan showing port 3389 (ms-wbt-server) in an open state.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>External IP address</li><li>Internal RDP servers</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to workstations and the internal network if employee credentials are stolen, phished, or otherwise compromised. Without a second factor, a single compromised password is sufficient for an attacker to gain access, potentially leading to lateral movement, data breaches, and system compromise. This was identified through a review of organizational security policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers</li><li>Internal network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees upon onboarding, nor does it provide annual refresher training for all employees. This lack of ongoing education leaves employees vulnerable to various social engineering tactics, such as phishing, pretexting, and malware delivery. Untrained employees are more likely to fall victim to these attacks, which can lead to credential compromise, malware infections, data loss, and other security incidents. This was identified through a review of organizational security policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data and systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is critically important to immediately close port 3389 to external access. For legitimate remote access needs, implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution that requires strong authentication, preferably with MFA, before allowing RDP connections to internal resources. Furthermore, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be implemented and enforced for all computer logins across the organization to significantly enhance access control. A comprehensive security awareness training program should be established, including mandatory training for all new employees upon onboarding and annual refresher training for all staff, covering topics such as phishing, password hygiene, data handling, and incident reporting. Regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing should also be conducted to identify and address emerging threats.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks, primarily stemming from an exposed RDP service and a critical gap in access control due to the absence of MFA for computer logins. The lack of a robust security awareness training program further exacerbates these vulnerabilities by increasing the human attack surface. While MFA is commendably used for email and sensitive data systems, these critical deficiencies in network perimeter security, access control, and employee education leave the organization highly susceptible to various cyberattacks, including unauthorized access, data breaches, and ransomware. Prompt and decisive action to implement the recommended mitigations is essential to improve the overall security posture and readiness.</p>
