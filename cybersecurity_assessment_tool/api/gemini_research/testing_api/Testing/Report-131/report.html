        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open SSH port (22), indicating a potential exposure. Furthermore, a review of organizational data highlighted significant deficiencies in security posture, including the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and sensitive data systems. Critical gaps were also identified in governance, with no employee acceptable use policy in place, and a complete lack of security awareness training for both new and existing employees. These findings collectively point to a high-risk environment with several critical and high-severity vulnerabilities.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed SSH Service - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An SSH service (port 22) was identified as open on the network. While SSH is a legitimate service, an exposed port without proper hardening (e.g., strong authentication, IP restrictions, regular patching) can serve as a critical entry point for unauthorized access. Given the high CVSS score of 10.0, this indicates a severe misconfiguration or lack of protection that could lead to full system compromise.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li><li>Port 22 (SSH Service)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for employees to log into their computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access. If an attacker obtains a single set of credentials (e.g., through phishing or malware), they can gain full access to an employee's workstation without an additional layer of security.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Login systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not enforced for accessing sensitive data systems. This presents a critical risk, as compromised credentials could grant attackers direct and unfettered access to confidential information, potentially leading to severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and significant reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User authentication mechanisms</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). Without a clear AUP, employees may be unaware of their responsibilities regarding the use of company IT assets, data handling, and internet usage. This absence can lead to inconsistent security practices, increased risk of misuse, accidental data exposure, and difficulty in enforcing disciplinary actions for security violations.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Organizational policies</li><li>Employee conduct</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training as part of their onboarding process. This leaves new hires vulnerable to common social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) and unaware of critical security protocols and best practices from day one. Untrained new employees can inadvertently introduce new attack vectors and increase the overall organizational risk.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Onboarding process</li><li>Human factor</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. Regular and updated training is crucial to keep employees informed about evolving cyber threats, new attack techniques, and reinforced secure behaviors. Without ongoing education, employees' security knowledge can become outdated, making them more susceptible to sophisticated attacks and weakening the organization's human firewall over time.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Ongoing security education</li><li>Human factor</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately investigate the open SSH port (22) to ensure it is properly secured, restricted to trusted networks, and utilizes strong authentication methods like key-based authentication and MFA. Implement and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and, critically, for all access to sensitive data systems. Develop and implement a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) that clearly outlines expectations for employee conduct regarding company IT resources and data. Establish a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees as part of their onboarding process, and implement a recurring, mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees to ensure ongoing education on current threats and best practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks stemming from both technical vulnerabilities, such as a potentially exposed SSH service, and critical gaps in its security policies and employee training programs. The absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for critical systems and general computer access, coupled with a lack of security awareness training and an acceptable use policy, creates a highly vulnerable environment. Addressing these foundational issues is paramount to improving the organization's overall security posture and readiness against evolving cyber threats.</p>
