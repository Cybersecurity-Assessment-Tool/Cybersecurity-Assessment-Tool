        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The network assessment identified an open port 80, indicating an active web server. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is utilized for email and sensitive data systems, it is not enforced for computer logins. Furthermore, the organization currently lacks both initial security awareness training for new employees and annual refresher training for all staff. These findings highlight critical vulnerabilities related to network access and human factors within the organization's security posture.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unsecured Web Server / Open Port 80 - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open port 80 was detected, indicating a web server is running. Without proper security configurations, such as HTTPS redirection, a Web Application Firewall (WAF), and up-to-date software, this port can be a gateway for various web-based attacks, including SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and directory traversal. The impact could range from data breaches to website defacement. This vulnerability was identified via an Nmap scan.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li><li>Web Server</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised through phishing, keyloggers, or brute-force attacks. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's workstation and potentially the internal network. This was identified from organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Internal network access</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) due to their unfamiliarity with organizational security policies and common threat vectors. This lack of training increases the likelihood of successful attacks that exploit human vulnerabilities, leading to data breaches, malware infections, or unauthorized access. This was identified from organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network security</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Regular Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. Regular training is crucial to keep employees informed about evolving threats, reinforce best practices, and maintain a strong security culture. Without ongoing education, employees may become complacent or unaware of new attack techniques, making them more susceptible to social engineering and other human-centric attacks. This was identified from organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network security</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to enhance protection against credential theft. The open port 80 should be thoroughly reviewed; if a web server is intended, ensure it is securely configured, patched, and ideally redirects to HTTPS. If the service is not needed, it should be disabled. Crucially, a comprehensive security awareness training program must be established, including mandatory training for all new employees upon onboarding and annual refresher courses for all existing staff. This will significantly improve the human firewall against social engineering attacks and reduce overall organizational risk.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several high-severity risks primarily stemming from a lack of robust human-centric security controls and an open network port. The absence of MFA for computer logins and the complete lack of security awareness training for both new and existing employees create significant opportunities for attackers to gain unauthorized access or compromise systems through social engineering. While some MFA is in place, these critical gaps indicate a need for immediate attention to strengthen the overall security posture and reduce the likelihood of successful cyberattacks.</p>
