        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes an Nginx web server (version 1.18.0) on port 443, indicating a public-facing web presence. However, a review of the organizational security posture reveals critical deficiencies in foundational security controls. There is a complete absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct security awareness training for new or existing employees. These gaps represent significant vulnerabilities that could be exploited.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email, logging into computers, or accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access should employee credentials be compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or other means. A single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to critical systems and data, leading to data breaches, financial loss, and reputational damage. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email systems</li><li>User workstations</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>All user accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines on the proper use of company IT resources, employees may unknowingly engage in activities that introduce security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive company data. This absence of policy can lead to increased exposure to malware, data leakage, and potential non-compliance with industry regulations. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee workstations</li><li>Company network infrastructure</li><li>Company data assets</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or annual training for all employees. This leaves the workforce highly susceptible to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting, business email compromise) and general human error. Untrained employees are more likely to click on malicious links, open infected attachments, or fall for impersonation scams, which can lead to malware infections, credential theft, and significant data breaches. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Email systems</li><li>Internal network</li><li>Sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Nginx Web Server - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The network scan identified an Nginx web server running version 1.18.0. This version is no longer actively maintained and has reached its end-of-life. Running outdated software increases the risk of known vulnerabilities being present and exploited, as security patches are no longer released for this version. Attackers can leverage publicly known CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) against this version to gain unauthorized access, disrupt services, or compromise the underlying server. This vulnerability was identified via network scanning.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Nginx web server (version 1.18.0)</li><li>Public-facing web services</li><li>Underlying server infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is imperative to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, as a top priority. Concurrently, develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy that clearly outlines expectations for IT resource usage. Furthermore, establish a mandatory security awareness training program for all new hires and conduct annual refresher training for all employees to educate them on common threats and best practices. Finally, the Nginx web server should be updated to a currently supported and patched version to mitigate known vulnerabilities and ensure ongoing security updates.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The current cybersecurity assessment reveals a critical lack of foundational security controls within the organization. The absence of MFA, an acceptable use policy, and security awareness training, coupled with an outdated web server, creates a highly vulnerable environment susceptible to various cyber threats, including unauthorized access, data breaches, and malware infections. Addressing these significant gaps with the recommended actions is crucial for improving the organization's readiness against cyberattacks and protecting its valuable assets.</p>
