        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization currently utilizes Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and conducts annual security awareness training for all employees. However, significant gaps were identified in other critical areas. There is no requirement for MFA to log into computers or to access sensitive data systems, which significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access. Furthermore, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not provide security awareness training for new employees. A network scan also revealed an open SSH port (22) on a host, presenting a potential entry point if not adequately secured.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH port (22) was detected on a network host. While SSH is a secure protocol, an open port increases the attack surface. If not properly secured with strong authentication (e.g., key-based authentication, MFA) and restricted access, it can be exploited for unauthorized access, brute-force attacks, or remote code execution. The scan identified an active SSH service.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 22</li><li>Network Host</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Authentication for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised through phishing, malware, or brute-force attacks. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's workstation, potentially leading to lateral movement within the network.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee Workstations</li><li>Authentication Systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Authentication for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk, as compromised credentials could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and regulatory non-compliance. Protecting sensitive data with only a single factor of authentication is a common vector for data exfiltration and severe data loss incidents.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive Data Systems</li><li>Data Repositories</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This means there are no formal guidelines for employees regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, internet, email, and data. This can lead to inconsistent security practices, increased risk of insider threats, and potential legal liabilities due to misuse of company assets or data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Organizational Policy</li><li>Employee Behavior</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Onboarding Security Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training. This leaves new hires vulnerable to common social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) and unaware of organizational security protocols from the start. It can lead to early security missteps and a higher likelihood of falling victim to attacks before they are properly educated on best practices.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New Employees</li><li>HR Onboarding Process</li><li>Security Culture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and, critically, for access to all sensitive data systems. For the open SSH port, ensure strong authentication methods like key-based authentication are enforced, disable password authentication, restrict access via firewall rules to only necessary source IPs, and consider changing the default port. The organization should develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to guide appropriate behavior and reduce insider risks. Furthermore, mandatory security awareness training must be integrated into the onboarding process for all new employees to establish a strong security culture from day one. Continue the existing annual security awareness training to reinforce best practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security through MFA for email and annual security awareness training. However, the absence of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, coupled with the lack of an acceptable use policy and new employee security training, represents significant vulnerabilities. The open SSH port also presents a direct technical risk. Addressing these critical gaps is paramount to enhancing the overall security posture, protecting sensitive data, and reducing the likelihood of successful cyberattacks.</p>
