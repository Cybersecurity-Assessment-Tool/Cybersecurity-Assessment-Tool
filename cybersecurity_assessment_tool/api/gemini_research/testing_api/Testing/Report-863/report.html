        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Based on the network scan, an open SSH port (22) was identified. The organization utilizes MFA for email access but lacks it for computer logins and sensitive data systems. An acceptable use policy is in place, and annual security awareness training is conducted, but new employees do not receive initial security awareness training.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A critical service, potentially intended for internal network access, appears to be exposed externally. This exposure, indicated by an open port 22 (SSH) on an unspecified IP, presents a severe risk of unauthorized access, brute-force attacks, or exploitation of SSH vulnerabilities. The impact could range from data exfiltration to full system compromise.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>1. Address Localhost Exposure: Immediately investigate the open port 22 (SSH). If external access is not required, restrict access to trusted IPs or internal networks only. If external access is necessary, ensure strong authentication (e.g., key-based authentication, MFA), disable root login, and implement robust intrusion detection/prevention systems. 2. Implement MFA: Extend Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to computer logins and sensitive data systems to significantly enhance access security and mitigate the risk of credential compromise. 3. Enhance Security Awareness Training: Introduce mandatory security awareness training for all new employees during their onboarding process to ensure they are aware of security best practices from day one. 4. Regular Vulnerability Scanning: Conduct regular, comprehensive vulnerability scans and penetration tests to identify and remediate exposed services and other security weaknesses proactively.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces critical security risks due to an exposed service (SSH) and significant gaps in its access control mechanisms, specifically the lack of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems. While an acceptable use policy and annual security training are positive, the absence of initial security awareness training for new employees and the critical vulnerability identified indicate a need for immediate action to strengthen the overall security posture and readiness against cyber threats.</p>
