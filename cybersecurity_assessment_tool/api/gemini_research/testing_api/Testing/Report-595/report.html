        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization currently employs Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access but lacks this critical security measure for computer logins and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, there is no established employee acceptable use policy, and while new employees receive security awareness training, annual training for all staff is not conducted. A network scan identified an open SSH port (22), which, if not properly secured, represents a potential entry point for unauthorized access.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication. An attacker with stolen credentials could gain access to internal systems, leading to data breaches or system compromise. This vulnerability was identified from the provided organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Servers</li><li>Network devices requiring login</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Sensitive data systems are not protected by MFA. This leaves critical organizational and customer data highly vulnerable to unauthorized access if an attacker compromises user credentials. The potential impact includes severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, significant financial penalties, and reputational damage. This vulnerability was identified from the provided organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Databases</li><li>File shares</li><li>CRM systems</li><li>HR systems</li><li>Financial applications</li><li>Any other systems storing sensitive organizational or customer data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines, employees may misuse company IT resources, access inappropriate content, or engage in risky online behaviors, increasing the likelihood of malware infections, data leakage, and potential legal liabilities. This vulnerability was identified from the provided organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT infrastructure</li><li>Organizational data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, annual training for all employees is not conducted. This results in a workforce that may not be up-to-date on the latest cyber threats, best practices, and organizational security policies, significantly increasing the risk of successful phishing attacks, social engineering, and other human-factor vulnerabilities. This vulnerability was identified from the provided organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port (22) - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A network scan revealed an open SSH port (22). While SSH is a legitimate service for remote administration, an open port without proper hardening (e.g., strong passwords, key-based authentication, rate limiting, IP restrictions, disabling root login) can be exploited by attackers for brute-force attacks, unauthorized access, or as a pivot point into the internal network. This vulnerability was identified from the network scan data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Server(s) hosting SSH service</li><li>Network perimeter</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and access to sensitive data systems. A comprehensive employee acceptable use policy should be developed, communicated, and enforced across the organization to guide proper IT resource usage. Furthermore, a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees must be established to keep the workforce informed about current threats and security best practices. Finally, all systems with an open SSH port 22 should be reviewed and hardened by enforcing strong authentication methods (preferably key-based), disabling root login, implementing IP-based access restrictions, and configuring intrusion detection/prevention systems to monitor for malicious activity.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several critical and high-severity security vulnerabilities, primarily due to insufficient authentication mechanisms for internal systems and sensitive data, and significant gaps in foundational security policies and training. The absence of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, coupled with the lack of an acceptable use policy and annual security awareness training, creates substantial exposure to credential theft, unauthorized access, and human-factor risks. The presence of an open SSH port without specified hardening measures also presents a direct attack vector. Addressing these issues through the immediate implementation of MFA, development of comprehensive policies, regular training, and diligent hardening of network services is paramount to improving the organization's overall security posture and reducing its attack surface.</p>
