        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open port 8080 exposing a service titled "TOP SECRET DB," indicating a critical vulnerability related to sensitive data exposure. Furthermore, an assessment of organizational policies highlighted two significant areas of concern: the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for sensitive data systems and the lack of annual security awareness training for all employees. While MFA is implemented for email and computer logins, its absence for critical data systems creates a substantial attack vector. The infrequent security training contributes to a potential human-factor vulnerability across the workforce.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unsecured Sensitive Data Exposure via Open Port - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open port 8080 was identified via an Nmap scan, exposing a service with the title "TOP SECRET DB". This indicates a potential direct exposure of highly sensitive information or access to a critical database without apparent authentication or proper security controls, posing a severe risk to data confidentiality.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li><li>TOP SECRET DB service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Authentication for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive data systems, as identified through organizational policy review. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical data if primary credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or other means.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Employee Security Awareness Gap - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual training for all employees, as identified through organizational policy review. This leads to a degradation of security knowledge over time, making employees more susceptible to social engineering attacks, phishing, and other human-factor vulnerabilities.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, immediate action is required. Firstly, the service exposed on port 8080, identified as "TOP SECRET DB," must be secured immediately. This involves either closing the port if the service is not intended to be public, implementing robust authentication and authorization controls, or moving the service behind a secure firewall with strict access rules. Secondly, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be implemented for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access even if primary credentials are compromised. Finally, a comprehensive annual security awareness training program should be established for all employees to continuously educate them on current threats, best practices, and the organization's acceptable use policies, thereby strengthening the human firewall.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces critical vulnerabilities, primarily stemming from an exposed "TOP SECRET DB" service and a lack of MFA for sensitive data systems, which together pose a severe risk to data confidentiality and integrity. Additionally, the absence of annual security awareness training creates a persistent human-factor vulnerability. While some security measures like MFA for email and computer logins are in place, these critical gaps significantly undermine the overall security posture, indicating a low state of readiness against sophisticated cyber threats. Immediate and decisive action is required to address these findings and enhance the organization's cybersecurity defenses.</p>
