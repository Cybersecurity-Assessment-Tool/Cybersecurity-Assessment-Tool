        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open FTP server running vsftpd 2.3.4 on port 21, which allows anonymous login. This version is significantly outdated and known to have critical vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the organizational data indicates several critical security posture weaknesses: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for computer logins, there is no employee acceptable use policy in place, and security awareness training is not conducted for new or existing employees. Additionally, a significant portion of workstations are running Windows 7, an end-of-life operating system, posing a severe risk.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Anonymous FTP Access & Outdated FTP Server - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An FTP server running vsftpd version 2.3.4 is accessible on port 21 and configured to allow anonymous login. This outdated software version is known to have critical vulnerabilities (e.g., CVE-2011-2523) and anonymous access can lead to unauthorized data exposure, data manipulation, or even server compromise if write permissions are misconfigured. This was identified via an Nmap scan with the 'ftp-anon' script.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>FTP Server (vsftpd 2.3.4)</li><li>Port 21</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to internal systems and data in the event of compromised credentials, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee Workstations</li><li>Login Systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines for the appropriate use of company IT resources, employees may inadvertently or intentionally engage in activities that compromise security, lead to data breaches, or result in non-compliance with regulations. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All Employees</li><li>IT Resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or annually for all employees. This leaves the workforce vulnerable to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, malware via email) and unaware of best practices for protecting sensitive information, significantly increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All Employees</li><li>Organizational Security Posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Windows Policy - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Computers are running Windows 7, which is an end-of-life operating system no longer receiving security updates from Microsoft. This exposes workstations to known and unpatched vulnerabilities, making them highly susceptible to malware, exploits, and advanced persistent threats. This was identified through an existing vulnerability assessment.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediate action is required to address the identified critical vulnerabilities. The anonymous FTP access on the outdated vsftpd server must be disabled, and the server should be updated to a currently supported version or replaced with a secure file transfer protocol like SFTP or FTPS. All workstations running Windows 7 must be upgraded to a supported operating system (e.g., Windows 10 or 11) to ensure they receive critical security patches. Furthermore, the organization must implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to enhance access security. It is crucial to develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy and establish mandatory security awareness training for all new hires, with annual refreshers for all employees, to cultivate a security-conscious culture and mitigate human-factor risks.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces a high level of cybersecurity risk due to a combination of critical technical vulnerabilities and significant gaps in security policies and employee training. The presence of an outdated, anonymously accessible FTP server and end-of-life operating systems on workstations creates immediate exploitation opportunities. The absence of MFA for computer logins, an acceptable use policy, and regular security awareness training further weakens the overall security posture, leaving the organization highly susceptible to data breaches, malware infections, and unauthorized access. Addressing these issues promptly is paramount to improving the organization's readiness against cyber threats.</p>
