        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security practices by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and conducting annual security awareness training for all employees. An acceptable use policy is also in place, which is a positive step towards establishing clear guidelines. However, critical gaps exist in the application of MFA for email access and sensitive data systems, leaving these high-value targets vulnerable to credential compromise. Furthermore, the absence of security awareness training for new employees poses a significant risk, as new hires may not be immediately equipped to identify and mitigate common cyber threats.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Email accounts are frequently targeted by attackers through phishing and other social engineering tactics. Without Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), a compromised password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's email, potentially leading to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, or further internal network penetration. This vulnerability was identified through the organization's self-reported security practices.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>User email accounts</li><li>Organizational communication</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Direct access to systems containing sensitive organizational data without Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) significantly elevates the risk of unauthorized access. If credentials for these systems are compromised, an attacker could gain immediate access to critical information, leading to severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and significant reputational and financial damage. This vulnerability was identified through the organization's self-reported security practices.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases storing sensitive information</li><li>User accounts with access to sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees, often unfamiliar with an organization's specific security policies, common threats, and internal procedures, are particularly susceptible to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, vishing). Without initial security awareness training during onboarding, they may inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities or fall victim to attacks, increasing the overall human risk factor for the organization. This vulnerability was identified through the organization's self-reported security practices.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li><li>Human element of security</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and sensitive data systems immediately. This will provide a crucial layer of defense against credential theft. Additionally, a mandatory security awareness training program should be established for all new employees as part of their onboarding process to ensure they are equipped with essential cybersecurity knowledge from day one. The existing annual security awareness training and acceptable use policy should be regularly reviewed and reinforced to maintain a strong security culture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has some foundational security measures in place, such as MFA for computer logins and annual security awareness training, significant vulnerabilities exist due to the lack of MFA for email and sensitive data systems, and the absence of initial security awareness training for new employees. Addressing these critical policy and procedural gaps is paramount to mitigating the risk of data breaches, unauthorized access, and social engineering attacks, thereby improving the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness.</p>
