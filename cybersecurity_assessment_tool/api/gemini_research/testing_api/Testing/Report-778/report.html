        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and computer logins, and conducting annual security awareness training for all employees. However, the assessment identified critical gaps in protecting sensitive data systems, establishing clear employee conduct guidelines, and ensuring new hires are immediately equipped with essential security knowledge. The absence of an acceptable use policy and specific security training for new employees introduces significant human-factor risks, while the lack of MFA for sensitive data systems leaves critical assets vulnerable to credential compromise.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Multi-Factor Authentication for Sensitive Data - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or other means. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to sensitive data, leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Missing Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This means there are no formal guidelines or rules for employees regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, internet, email, and data. Without such a policy, employees may unknowingly engage in risky behaviors, such as visiting malicious websites, downloading unauthorized software, or mishandling sensitive information, leading to increased exposure to malware, data loss, and legal liabilities.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Network infrastructure</li><li>Organizational data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient New Employee Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. While annual training is provided, new hires are particularly vulnerable as they may not be immediately aware of the organization's security policies, common threats (e.g., phishing), and best practices. This gap leaves new employees susceptible to social engineering attacks and increases the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents during their initial employment period.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network security</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised. Concurrently, a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy should be developed, communicated, and enforced to establish clear guidelines for the appropriate use of company IT resources and data. Furthermore, a mandatory security awareness training program specifically for new employees must be introduced as part of their onboarding process to ensure they are aware of security best practices and organizational policies from day one. Regular reviews and updates of these policies and training materials are also advised to adapt to evolving threat landscapes.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization has made positive strides in implementing MFA for email and computer logins, and conducting annual security awareness training. However, significant vulnerabilities persist due to the lack of MFA for sensitive data systems, the absence of an acceptable use policy, and the omission of security awareness training for new employees. Addressing these critical gaps is essential to enhance the overall security posture, reduce the risk of data breaches, and foster a more secure operational environment.</p>
