                "Summary": "The organization's network includes an FTP server running vsftpd 2.3.4. Policy-wise, the organization has an acceptable use policy and conducts annual security awareness training for all employees. However, there are significant gaps in multi-factor authentication (MFA) implementation across email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, and new employees do not receive initial security awareness training.",

                        "Risk": "Outdated Operating System",
                        "Overview": "Workstations are running Windows 7, which has reached its end-of-life for mainstream support. This means it no longer receives security updates, making systems highly vulnerable to known exploits and increasing the risk of malware infection and data breaches.",

                        "Risk": "Anonymous FTP Access",
                        "Overview": "The FTP server (vsftpd 2.3.4) allows anonymous login. This configuration can lead to unauthorized access to files, potential data exposure, or even unauthorized file uploads, which could be used to host malicious content or compromise the server further. The vsftpd 2.3.4 version itself is also very old and likely has known vulnerabilities.",

                        "Risk": "No MFA for Email",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing attacks or brute-force attempts, as a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's email.",

                        "Overview": "Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for logging into computers. This makes workstations vulnerable to unauthorized access if passwords are stolen or guessed, potentially leading to lateral movement within the network and access to sensitive internal resources.",

                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This is a critical security gap, as it allows direct access to highly confidential information with only a single factor of authentication, making these systems prime targets for attackers.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Inadequate New Employee Security Training",
                        "Overview": "New employees do not receive security awareness training. This leaves them susceptible to social engineering attacks, phishing, and unaware of organizational security policies and best practices from the start, increasing the overall human risk factor.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "New employees",

                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "Immediately upgrade all workstations running Windows 7 to a currently supported operating system like Windows 10 or 11, considering a hardware refresh if necessary. Disable anonymous FTP access immediately; if FTP is still required, ensure strong authentication is enforced and consider migrating to a more secure file transfer protocol like SFTP or SCP, and upgrade vsftpd to the latest stable version or replace it. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, prioritizing sensitive data systems, followed by email access, and then computer logins. Introduce mandatory security awareness training for all new employees as part of their onboarding process, covering common threats and organizational security policies, and continue annual training for all employees.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces several significant cybersecurity risks, primarily stemming from outdated software, insecure service configurations, and a critical lack of multi-factor authentication across key systems including email, computer logins, and sensitive data access. While an acceptable use policy and annual security training for existing employees are positive, the absence of training for new hires and the widespread MFA gap leave the organization highly vulnerable to account compromise, data breaches, and unauthorized system access. Addressing these vulnerabilities, particularly the implementation of MFA and securing the FTP server, is paramount to improving the overall security posture and readiness."
