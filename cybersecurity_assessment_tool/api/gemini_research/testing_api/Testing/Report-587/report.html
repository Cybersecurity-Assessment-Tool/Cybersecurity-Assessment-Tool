        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open SSH port (22) on at least one host. From an organizational policy standpoint, while Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required for computer logins, it is notably absent for email access and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees, though new hires do receive initial training.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A critical vulnerability was identified where a localhost service is exposed, potentially allowing unauthorized access to internal resources. This exposure carries a high risk of system compromise and data breach.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Weak Email Authentication - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of email account compromise through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks, potentially leading to business email compromise (BEC) and unauthorized access to sensitive communications.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>User accounts</li><li>Email data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Sensitive Data System Authentication - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Access to sensitive data systems does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). This critical oversight leaves sensitive information highly vulnerable to unauthorized access and exfiltration if primary credentials are compromised, posing severe risks for data privacy, regulatory compliance, and reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>User accounts</li><li>Confidential data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines on the appropriate use of company IT resources, employees may inadvertently engage in risky behaviors, leading to increased exposure to malware, data leakage, and potential legal or compliance issues.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employees</li><li>IT infrastructure</li><li>Company data</li><li>Organizational policies</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive initial security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual training for all employees. This gap means employees may not be updated on the latest threats and best practices, increasing their susceptibility to social engineering attacks, phishing, and other human-factor vulnerabilities over time.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security culture</li><li>Phishing susceptibility</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port - <span class="severity-Low">Low</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH port (22) was identified on at least one host. While SSH is a legitimate service, an improperly secured or unmonitored open SSH port can be a target for brute-force attacks, unauthorized access, or serve as an entry point for attackers if weak credentials or unpatched vulnerabilities exist. It requires careful management and monitoring.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with port 22 open</li><li>SSH service</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and sensitive data systems to significantly enhance authentication security. Furthermore, a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy should be developed, communicated, and enforced to establish clear guidelines for IT resource usage. Regular, at least annual, security awareness training must be provided to all employees to keep them informed about evolving threats and best practices. The 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability requires immediate investigation and remediation to prevent unauthorized access to internal services. Finally, all open network ports, such as SSH (port 22), should be reviewed to ensure they are strictly necessary, properly configured with strong authentication, and regularly monitored for suspicious activity.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In conclusion, the organization exhibits critical vulnerabilities related to authentication for email and sensitive data, alongside significant gaps in foundational security policies and ongoing employee training. While some security measures are in place (MFA for computer logins, new employee training), the absence of MFA for key systems, a formal acceptable use policy, and annual security awareness training creates a substantial attack surface. Addressing these areas is paramount to improving the overall security posture and readiness against modern cyber threats.</p>
