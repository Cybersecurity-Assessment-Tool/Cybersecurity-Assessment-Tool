            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization demonstrates a foundational level of network security, with an Nmap scan indicating no immediately apparent open ports on scanned hosts, suggesting a controlled external attack surface. Internally, the organization has implemented strong multi-factor authentication (MFA) for critical access points including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, which significantly enhances identity and access management. An employee acceptable use policy is also in place, and new employees receive security awareness training. However, a notable gap exists in the frequency of security awareness training for all existing employees.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. This oversight creates a significant human-factor vulnerability, increasing the risk of successful social engineering attacks such as phishing, pretexting, and business email compromise. Employees who are not regularly educated on evolving cyber threats and best security practices are more susceptible to making errors that could lead to data breaches, malware infections, or unauthorized access. This vulnerability was identified through the review of organizational security policies and practices.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "Organizational data",
                            "Network systems",
                            "Email infrastructure"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risk, it is strongly recommended that the organization implement a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees. This training should cover current threat landscapes, phishing recognition, password hygiene, data handling best practices, and incident reporting procedures. Regular refreshers and simulated phishing exercises can further reinforce learned behaviors and improve overall human firewall effectiveness. Additionally, consider tailoring training content to specific roles and responsibilities within the organization to address unique risk profiles.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization has established a commendable security posture with robust MFA implementation across critical access points and a controlled network perimeter. These measures significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and external exploitation. However, the absence of annual security awareness training for all employees represents a key area for improvement. Addressing this human-factor vulnerability is crucial to building a comprehensive defense-in-depth strategy and enhancing the organization's overall resilience against sophisticated cyber threats."
