        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes an Nginx web server (version 1.18.0) on port 443 (HTTPS). Internally, the organization lacks multi-factor authentication (MFA) for critical access points including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. While an acceptable use policy is in place and annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees, there is no specific security awareness training for new employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The absence of MFA across email, computer login, and sensitive data systems significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access. If an attacker compromises a single set of credentials, they gain full access to these critical resources without an additional layer of security. This vulnerability was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email access</li><li>Computer login</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Nginx Web Server - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nginx web server running on version 1.18.0 is not the latest stable release. Older software versions often contain known vulnerabilities that have been patched in newer releases. Running an outdated version exposes the organization to potential exploits that target these known weaknesses, which could lead to data breaches, denial of service, or unauthorized access. This was identified via network scan data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Nginx 1.18.0 web server (port 443)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While annual security awareness training is provided, the lack of dedicated training for new employees means that individuals joining the organization may not be immediately aware of current security policies, best practices, and common threats (e.g., phishing, social engineering). This oversight can lead to new employees inadvertently introducing vulnerabilities or falling victim to attacks during their initial employment period. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Overall organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, immediate implementation of multi-factor authentication (MFA) is crucial for all email accounts, computer logins, and access to sensitive data systems. This will provide a vital additional layer of security against credential compromise. Furthermore, the Nginx web server should be updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities and ensure ongoing security. Finally, a comprehensive security awareness training program specifically tailored for new employees should be established to ensure all personnel are equipped with the necessary knowledge to identify and mitigate cybersecurity risks from day one.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to the absence of multi-factor authentication across critical systems, the use of outdated web server software, and a gap in security awareness training for new hires. While an acceptable use policy and annual training are positive steps, these vulnerabilities leave the organization susceptible to unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Addressing these issues promptly is essential to improve the overall security readiness and protect organizational assets.</p>
