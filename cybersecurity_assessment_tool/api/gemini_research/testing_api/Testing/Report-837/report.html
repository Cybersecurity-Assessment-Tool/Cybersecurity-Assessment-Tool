        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network assessment reveals several critical gaps in its security posture, primarily concerning authentication mechanisms and employee security awareness. While a network scan identified an open port 8080 labeled "TOP SECRET DB", this was reported as a false positive and secured. However, the organization currently lacks Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across critical access points including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, there is an absence of both initial and annual security awareness training for employees, which significantly elevates the human risk factor. An acceptable use policy is in place, which is a positive foundational element.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are compromised, leading to potential data breaches, phishing attacks, and business email compromise. Identified from organizational policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if user credentials are stolen or guessed, potentially allowing attackers to gain a foothold in the internal network. Identified from organizational policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Servers</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk, as compromised credentials could grant direct access to confidential information, leading to severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and reputational damage. Identified from organizational policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Hires - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training. This means they may not be aware of common cyber threats (e.g., phishing, social engineering) or organizational security policies, making them more susceptible to attacks and potentially introducing vulnerabilities into the organization. Identified from organizational policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. Regular training is crucial to keep employees updated on evolving threats and reinforce best practices, reducing the overall human risk factor. Without it, employees may forget previous training or be unaware of new attack vectors. Identified from organizational policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>

            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open Port 8080 (TOP SECRET DB) - <span class="severity-Info">Info</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Nmap scan identified port 8080 as open, with the HTTP title "TOP SECRET DB". While the provided "Current Risks" data indicates this port is "Secured" and a "false positive" with a CVSS score of 0.0, the presence of an open port labeled "TOP SECRET DB" warrants attention. For the purpose of this report, we acknowledge the "false positive" claim from the provided risk data, but highlight the potential for misconfiguration or oversight if this claim is inaccurate.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Server hosting port 8080</li><li>"TOP SECRET DB" service</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's cybersecurity posture, immediate implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is strongly recommended for all email accounts, computer logins, and especially for access to sensitive data systems. This will provide a crucial layer of defense against credential theft. Concurrently, a comprehensive security awareness training program should be established. This program must include mandatory training for all new employees upon onboarding and annual refresher training for all existing employees to ensure continuous education on evolving cyber threats and best practices. While the open port 8080 was deemed a false positive, it is prudent to conduct a thorough internal review of its configuration and purpose to ensure it is indeed secure and properly documented, mitigating any potential future misunderstandings or misconfigurations.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In conclusion, the organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication across key access points and a complete lack of security awareness training for its workforce. These deficiencies create substantial vulnerabilities to credential compromise, social engineering attacks, and unauthorized access to sensitive information. While an acceptable use policy is present, its effectiveness is diminished without accompanying training and robust authentication controls. Addressing these fundamental security gaps is paramount to improving the organization's overall readiness against cyber threats and protecting its critical assets.</p>
