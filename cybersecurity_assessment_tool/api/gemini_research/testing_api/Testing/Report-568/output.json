            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization currently has a foundational security posture with an acceptable use policy and regular security awareness training for all employees. However, critical gaps exist in multi-factor authentication (MFA) implementation across key access points. Network scans did not reveal any immediate open port vulnerabilities.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Inadequate Email Security",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks. Compromised email accounts can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and further lateral movement within the network. This was identified through the organizational data indicating \"No\" to MFA for email access.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Email system",
                            "Employee accounts",
                            "Organizational data accessible via email"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Inadequate Workstation Security",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This leaves workstations vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials (username/password) are compromised. An attacker gaining access to a computer could potentially access internal resources, sensitive data, or deploy malware, leading to data breaches or operational disruption. This was identified through the organizational data indicating \"No\" to MFA for computer login.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Employee workstations",
                            "Network access points",
                            "Internal systems"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "It is strongly recommended that the organization implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and computer logins. For email, this should include all employee accounts to prevent unauthorized access and mitigate phishing risks. For computer logins, MFA should be enforced for all workstations and servers to enhance endpoint security. Additionally, while not identified as a vulnerability, regular reviews of the acceptable use policy and security awareness training content should be conducted to ensure they remain current and effective against evolving threats.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization demonstrates a commitment to security through its established acceptable use policy and consistent security awareness training programs. However, the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and computer logins represents a significant security vulnerability. Addressing these MFA gaps is critical to enhancing the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and reducing the risk of credential-based attacks and unauthorized system access. The current readiness is moderate, with strong foundational policies but critical technical implementation gaps."
