        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's security posture, based on the provided organizational data, indicates a mixed readiness level. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required for computer logins and sensitive data systems, it is notably absent for email access. The organization has an acceptable use policy in place, which is a positive step. However, a significant gap exists in security awareness training, as neither new employees nor all employees annually receive such training. Due to broken network scan data and current risks information, a comprehensive technical vulnerability assessment could not be performed, limiting the scope of this report to policy and access control observations.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Email Security - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. Compromised email accounts can lead to data breaches, business email compromise (BEC) scams, and further lateral movement within the network. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data provided, which explicitly states 'Do you require MFA to access email?':'No'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email accounts</li><li>Email servers</li><li>User credentials</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Untrained New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often targets for social engineering attacks as they may be less familiar with organizational security policies and common threats. This lack of initial training exposes the organization to risks such as phishing, malware infections, and policy violations from the outset of an employee's tenure. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data provided, which explicitly states 'Does your organization do security awareness training for new employees?':'No'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Stale Security Awareness - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. Without regular, updated training, employees may forget best practices, become complacent, or be unaware of new and evolving threats (e.g., new phishing techniques, ransomware variants). This increases the overall human risk factor, making the organization more susceptible to social engineering, malware, and data loss incidents. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data provided, which explicitly states 'Does your organization do security awareness training for all employees at least once per year?':'No'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access. This critical step will significantly enhance protection against credential theft and unauthorized account access. Furthermore, a comprehensive security awareness training program should be established. This program must include mandatory training for all new employees upon onboarding and annual refresher training for all existing employees to ensure continuous education on evolving threats and best practices. Regular training will empower employees to recognize and report potential security incidents, thereby strengthening the organization's human firewall.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Based on the available organizational data, the organization exhibits critical vulnerabilities related to email access security and employee security awareness. While some positive security controls are in place (MFA for computers/sensitive data, acceptable use policy), the absence of MFA for email and a structured security awareness training program for both new and existing employees leaves the organization exposed to significant risks from social engineering, phishing, and credential compromise. Addressing these human and access control vulnerabilities is paramount to improving the overall cybersecurity readiness and reducing the likelihood of successful cyberattacks.</p>
