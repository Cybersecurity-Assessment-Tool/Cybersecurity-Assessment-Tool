            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network currently operates with an identified FTP server (vsftpd 2.3.4) that permits anonymous login, posing a significant risk of unauthorized access and data exposure. Internally, while Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is mandated for email and sensitive data systems, it is notably absent for computer logins, leaving a critical vulnerability for workstation access. Furthermore, the organization lacks essential security awareness training for both new hires and existing employees on an annual basis, increasing susceptibility to social engineering and human error. An acceptable use policy is in place, which is a positive step, but its effectiveness is diminished without proper training and enforcement mechanisms. A critical finding is the presence of workstations running an outdated, end-of-life operating system (Windows 7), which no longer receives security updates, making these systems highly vulnerable to known exploits.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Anonymous FTP Login Allowed & Outdated FTP Service",
                        "Overview": "The FTP server, identified as vsftpd version 2.3.4, is configured to allow anonymous login. This configuration permits unauthorized users to access files on the server without authentication, potentially leading to data leakage, unauthorized file uploads, or even server compromise if write permissions are misconfigured. Additionally, vsftpd 2.3.4 is an outdated version, which may contain known vulnerabilities that could be exploited. This was identified via an Nmap scan that reported 'ftp-anon: Anonymous FTP login allowed'.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Outdated Operating System (Windows 7)",
                        "Overview": "Several computers within the organization are running Windows 7, an operating system that has reached its end-of-life. This means Microsoft no longer provides security updates, patches, or technical support for Windows 7. Systems running this OS are highly susceptible to known vulnerabilities, malware, and advanced persistent threats, as new exploits will not be patched, significantly increasing the risk of compromise and data breaches. This was identified through existing vulnerability reports.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Workstations running Windows 7"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Computer Logins",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. While MFA is used for email and sensitive data, its absence for workstation access means that a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to an employee's computer and potentially the internal network. This significantly elevates the risk of unauthorized access, lateral movement within the network, and data exfiltration, as it removes a crucial layer of defense against credential theft. This was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                        ]

                    {
                        "Risk": "Insufficient Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees, nor does it provide annual training for all employees. This lack of regular education leaves the workforce vulnerable to social engineering attacks such as phishing, ransomware, and other forms of malware. Employees who are not regularly updated on current threats and best practices are more likely to make errors that could lead to security incidents, compromising organizational data and systems. This was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "Organizational data",
                            "Network infrastructure"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, immediate action is required across several fronts. Firstly, the FTP server should be secured by disabling anonymous access and updating vsftpd to a current, supported version. For enhanced security, consider migrating to SFTP or FTPS. Secondly, all workstations running Windows 7 must be upgraded to a currently supported operating system, such as Windows 10 or 11, to ensure they receive critical security updates. Thirdly, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) should be implemented and enforced for all computer logins to significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access from compromised credentials. Lastly, a comprehensive security awareness training program must be established. This program should include mandatory training for all new employees and annual refresher courses for the entire staff to educate them on current threats, best practices, and the organization's acceptable use policy.",
            "Conclusion": "The current cybersecurity posture of the organization presents several critical and high-severity vulnerabilities, primarily stemming from outdated systems, weak authentication practices for workstation access, and a significant gap in employee security awareness training. The presence of an anonymous FTP server and end-of-life operating systems creates immediate entry points for attackers, while the lack of MFA for computer logins and insufficient training leaves the organization highly susceptible to credential theft and social engineering. While an acceptable use policy is in place, its effectiveness is limited without proper enforcement and education. Addressing these vulnerabilities promptly through system upgrades, robust authentication implementation, and continuous security education is paramount to enhancing the organization's overall security readiness and protecting its assets from evolving cyber threats."
