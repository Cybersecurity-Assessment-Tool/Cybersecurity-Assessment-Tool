        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes a critical service, Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) on port 3389, to the internet. While the organization utilizes Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and conducts regular security awareness training for all employees, there are notable gaps in their security posture. Specifically, MFA is not required for accessing email or sensitive data systems, and there is no employee acceptable use policy in place.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>RDP Exposure - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed to the internet via an open port 3389. This allows potential external attackers to attempt to gain access to internal systems, significantly increasing the attack surface. Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, system compromise, or ransomware deployment. This vulnerability was identified through network scanning.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the critical RDP exposure, it is strongly recommended to immediately close port 3389 to the internet. For legitimate remote access needs, implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution to ensure secure and encrypted connections. Additionally, enhance overall security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and sensitive data systems. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to establish clear guidelines for technology usage and reduce insider risks.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization faces a critical security risk due to an exposed RDP service, which provides a direct entry point for potential attackers. While efforts are made in security awareness training and MFA for computer logins, the absence of MFA for email and sensitive data, along with a lack of an acceptable use policy, indicates significant vulnerabilities. Addressing these critical issues and implementing the recommended security controls is paramount to improving the organization's cybersecurity readiness and protecting its assets.</p>
