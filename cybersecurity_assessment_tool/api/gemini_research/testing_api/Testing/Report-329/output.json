            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network currently exposes an RDP service on port 3389, indicating a potential direct access point to internal systems. While the organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, there is a critical gap in requiring MFA for access to sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization lacks fundamental security practices, including an employee acceptable use policy and any form of security awareness training for both new and existing employees.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "RDP Exposure",
                        "Overview": "Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is directly exposed to the internet. This allows potential attackers to attempt brute-force attacks or exploit known vulnerabilities in the RDP service to gain unauthorized access to internal systems. The impact could range from unauthorized data access to full system compromise. This was identified through network scanning which revealed an open RDP port.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "IP"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "It is strongly recommended to immediately close the exposed RDP port (3389) to the internet. For secure remote access, implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution that requires strong authentication. Additionally, implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy. Crucially, establish and conduct mandatory security awareness training for all new employees and annual refresher training for all staff to educate them on cybersecurity best practices, phishing, and social engineering threats.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces a critical vulnerability due to an exposed RDP service, which significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access and system compromise. While MFA is in place for email and computer logins, the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems, coupled with a complete lack of security awareness training and an acceptable use policy, indicates a low state of cybersecurity readiness. Addressing these fundamental gaps is paramount to improving the organization's overall security posture."
