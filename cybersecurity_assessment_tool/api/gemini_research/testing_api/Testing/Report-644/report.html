        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Based on the provided data, the organization's network has an open port 80, indicating a web server or service is accessible. The organization has some good security practices in place, such as requiring MFA for computer logins and conducting security awareness training for new employees, along with an acceptable use policy. However, significant gaps exist in MFA implementation for email and sensitive data systems, and recurring security awareness training for all employees is not conducted annually.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unsecured Web Service Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open port 80 was detected, indicating an HTTP service is running and accessible. Without proper security configurations (e.g., HTTPS redirection, WAF, regular patching), this service could be vulnerable to various web-based attacks, including information disclosure, cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, or denial-of-service. The impact could range from data breaches to service disruption. Identified via Nmap scan.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li><li>Web server/service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of email account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. A compromised email account can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, or further lateral movement within the network. Identified from organizational policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee email accounts</li><li>Email system</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are stolen or compromised. Attackers could gain direct access to confidential information, leading to severe data breaches, regulatory fines, and reputational damage. Identified from organizational policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts with access to sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Recurring Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. While new employees receive training, the lack of regular, recurring training means employees may forget best practices, become complacent, or not be updated on new threats (e.g., evolving phishing techniques). This increases the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents, such as falling for phishing scams or mishandling sensitive information. Identified from organizational policy data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security culture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediately assess the service running on port 80. If it's a web server, ensure it's configured to redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS, implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF), and keep all web server software and applications patched and up-to-date. If the service is not intended to be public, restrict access to internal networks or specific IP addresses. Implement mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and all sensitive data systems. This is a critical step to significantly enhance credential security and prevent unauthorized access even if passwords are compromised. Establish a mandatory annual (or more frequent) security awareness training program for all employees. This training should cover current threats, phishing recognition, data handling best practices, and incident reporting procedures to maintain a strong human firewall. Regularly review network configurations, conduct vulnerability assessments, and penetration testing to identify and remediate potential weaknesses proactively.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security with MFA for computer logins and initial employee training. However, critical vulnerabilities exist due to the lack of MFA for email and sensitive data systems, which are prime targets for attackers. The presence of an open HTTP port also poses a significant risk if not properly secured. Furthermore, the absence of annual security awareness training for all employees leaves the organization susceptible to social engineering and human error. Addressing these gaps, particularly the implementation of MFA across all critical access points and consistent security education, is paramount to improving the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and readiness against evolving threats.</p>
