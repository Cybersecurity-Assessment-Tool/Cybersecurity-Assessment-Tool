        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes a MySQL database (version 5.7.33) on port 3306, indicating a potential direct access point to sensitive data. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is in place for email and sensitive data systems, it is notably absent for computer logins. Furthermore, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees, despite providing it for new hires. These gaps suggest a mixed state of security readiness, with critical technical vulnerabilities alongside significant policy and training deficiencies.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The MySQL database server is accessible directly from the network via port 3306. This exposure allows potential attackers to attempt unauthorized access, brute-force attacks, or exploit known vulnerabilities in MySQL version 5.7.33. The impact could range from data exfiltration to complete database compromise, leading to significant data breaches and operational disruption. This was identified through network scanning which revealed the open port and service.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted internal IP addresses or specific application servers. For a long-term solution, consider placing the database behind a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or within a more isolated network segment. Additionally, implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to enhance access control. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to define expected behavior and secure practices. Finally, establish a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees to ensure continuous education on current threats and best security practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization faces a significant security risk due to an exposed MySQL database, which could lead to unauthorized access and data compromise. This technical vulnerability is compounded by organizational weaknesses, including the absence of MFA for computer logins, a formal acceptable use policy, and comprehensive annual security awareness training for all staff. While some security measures are in place (MFA for email and sensitive data), the current readiness level is suboptimal, requiring immediate attention to both technical controls and foundational security policies and training to effectively protect organizational assets.</p>
