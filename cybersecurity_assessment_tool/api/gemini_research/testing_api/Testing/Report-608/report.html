        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open HTTP port (80), indicating a potential web service or unencrypted communication channel. Internally, the organization has an acceptable use policy and requires MFA for computer logins. However, critical gaps exist in security posture, specifically the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, there is no security awareness training for new employees, nor is there annual training for all employees, which significantly increases human-factor risks.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. Compromised email accounts can lead to further attacks, data breaches, and business email compromise (BEC) scams.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are stolen or guessed. A breach of these systems could result in significant data loss, regulatory fines, reputational damage, and operational disruption.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>File shares</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires may not be aware of the organization's security policies, common cyber threats (e.g., phishing, social engineering), or best practices for data handling. This increases the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. Regular training is crucial to keep employees updated on evolving threats, reinforce security best practices, and maintain a strong security culture. Without it, employees may become complacent or unaware of new attack vectors.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open HTTP Port (80) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The network scan identified an open HTTP port (80). While HTTP is a standard protocol for web traffic, it transmits data, including potentially sensitive information, in plain text without encryption. This makes it vulnerable to eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attacks, and session hijacking. If a web server is running on this port, it could also be susceptible to various web application vulnerabilities if not properly secured and patched.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Network perimeter</li><li>Web server (if present)</li><li>Client-server communications over port 80</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and sensitive data systems immediately. This is a critical step to prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised. Additionally, a comprehensive security awareness training program should be established, including mandatory training for all new employees and annual refresher training for the entire workforce. This will help educate employees on current threats and best security practices. For the open HTTP port 80, it is advised to assess its purpose. If it hosts a web service, ensure it is properly secured, regularly patched, and ideally, migrate to HTTPS (port 443) to encrypt all traffic. If the port is not essential, it should be closed or restricted.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to the absence of MFA for key systems and a lack of consistent security awareness training. While MFA is in place for computer logins and an acceptable use policy exists, these measures are insufficient to protect against modern threats. The open HTTP port also presents a potential entry point for attackers. Addressing these vulnerabilities is crucial to enhance the organization's overall security posture and readiness against cyberattacks.</p>
