        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open port 8080 exposing a service titled "TOP SECRET DB", indicating a critical data exposure risk. Furthermore, the organization lacks fundamental security controls, including multi-factor authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. There is also an absence of an employee acceptable use policy and any form of security awareness training for both new and existing employees. These deficiencies collectively point to a very low security posture and high susceptibility to various cyber threats.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed "TOP SECRET DB" on Port 8080 - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open port 8080 was identified, hosting a service explicitly titled "TOP SECRET DB". This indicates a severe data exposure vulnerability, potentially allowing unauthorized access to highly sensitive information. The impact could be catastrophic, leading to data breaches, regulatory fines, reputational damage, and operational disruption. This was identified via an Nmap scan showing an open port 8080 with the http-title script revealing "TOP SECRET DB".</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li><li>"TOP SECRET DB" service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce MFA for email access, computer logins, or sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access through compromised credentials (e.g., phishing, brute-force attacks). Without MFA, a single stolen password can grant an attacker full access to critical systems and data. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email systems</li><li>Employee workstations/laptops</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal Acceptable Use Policy for employees. This absence means there are no clear guidelines regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, data handling, and internet usage, leading to potential misuse, data leakage, and increased risk of insider threats or accidental security incidents. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational IT resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or annual training for all employees. This leaves employees vulnerable to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) and unaware of best practices for data protection and secure computing. Human error is a leading cause of security breaches, and the lack of training exacerbates this risk. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data and systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediately address the critical exposure on port 8080 by securing or shutting down the "TOP SECRET DB" service. Implement robust authentication mechanisms, including multi-factor authentication (MFA), across all critical systems such as email, computer logins, and sensitive data access points to prevent unauthorized access from compromised credentials. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to establish clear guidelines for IT resource usage and data handling. Furthermore, establish and regularly conduct mandatory security awareness training for all employees, both new hires and existing staff, to educate them on common cyber threats, best practices, and their role in maintaining organizational security. Regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing should be performed to identify and remediate further weaknesses.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks due to a critical data exposure on port 8080 and a widespread lack of fundamental security controls and employee awareness programs. The absence of MFA, an AUP, and security training creates a highly vulnerable environment susceptible to various attack vectors, including credential theft, data breaches, and social engineering. Urgent action is required to mitigate these identified risks and establish a foundational security posture to protect sensitive data and maintain operational integrity.</p>
