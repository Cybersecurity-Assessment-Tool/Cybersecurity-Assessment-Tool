        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed a critical vulnerability with an exposed 'TOP SECRET DB' accessible via port 8080, indicating a severe lack of access control for sensitive information. Furthermore, the organizational data indicates significant gaps in foundational security practices, including the complete absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. The organization also lacks an acceptable use policy and does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees, leaving it highly susceptible to human-factor risks and policy violations. While new employees receive initial training, the lack of ongoing education diminishes its long-term effectiveness.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unsecured Sensitive Database Exposure - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A database identified as 'TOP SECRET DB' is openly accessible via port 8080. This indicates a severe misconfiguration or lack of access control, potentially exposing highly sensitive information to unauthorized parties. The impact could be data breaches, intellectual property theft, and significant reputational damage. This was identified via Nmap's http-title script.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li><li>TOP SECRET DB service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for email access. This significantly increases the risk of email account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing, leading to potential business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and impersonation.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for logging into computers. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are stolen or guessed, potentially allowing attackers to gain a foothold in the internal network, escalate privileges, and access sensitive resources.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All organizational computers</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for accessing sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk to the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information, making these systems highly susceptible to unauthorized access and data breaches if credentials are compromised. This is particularly concerning given the discovery of an exposed 'TOP SECRET DB'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts</li><li>TOP SECRET DB</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of an Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines, employees may engage in activities that introduce security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling company data, leading to increased exposure to malware, data loss, and compliance issues.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational network and data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Recurring Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, there is no annual or recurring training for all employees. This means that security knowledge and best practices may degrade over time, leaving the organization vulnerable to evolving threats like advanced phishing techniques, social engineering, and malware.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediately secure the 'TOP SECRET DB' on port 8080 by implementing stringent access controls, firewall rules, and authentication mechanisms, or by removing it from public exposure if not intended. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, including email, computer logins, and especially sensitive data systems, to significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access. Develop and enforce a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) to establish clear guidelines for technology usage and data handling. Furthermore, establish a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees to ensure continuous education on current threats and best practices, reinforcing the initial training provided to new hires.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces critical security vulnerabilities, primarily due to an exposed sensitive database and a complete lack of Multi-Factor Authentication across key systems. These technical weaknesses are compounded by significant gaps in security policies and employee training, indicating a low level of readiness against modern cyber threats. Addressing these fundamental issues is paramount to protecting sensitive data and maintaining operational integrity.</p>
