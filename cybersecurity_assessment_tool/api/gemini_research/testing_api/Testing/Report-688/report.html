        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a strong foundation in technical security controls, particularly with the widespread implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and access to sensitive data systems. Network scans indicate no open ports, suggesting a well-secured perimeter from external threats. However, significant gaps exist in foundational security policies and ongoing employee education. The absence of an employee acceptable use policy and the lack of annual security awareness training for all employees represent critical areas of concern that could undermine the effectiveness of existing technical safeguards.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. This policy is fundamental for establishing clear guidelines on the appropriate use of company IT resources, data, and networks. Without such a policy, employees may be unaware of expected behaviors, leading to potential misuse of assets, data leakage, or non-compliance with industry regulations. This increases the risk of insider threats, accidental data breaches, and legal liabilities. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating no such policy is in place.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT assets</li><li>Company data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. Regular and ongoing training is crucial to keep staff informed about evolving cyber threats, social engineering tactics (e.g., phishing, ransomware), and best security practices. Without periodic refreshers, employees are more susceptible to falling victim to sophisticated attacks, which can lead to system compromises, data breaches, and financial losses. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating a lack of annual training for all employees.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company data</li><li>Email systems</li><li>Network access</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization develop and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy. This policy should clearly define expectations for employee conduct regarding company IT resources, data handling, and internet usage. Furthermore, the organization must establish and enforce a program for mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees. This training should cover current threat landscapes, social engineering techniques, data protection best practices, and the organization's security policies, including the newly implemented acceptable use policy. Regular training will significantly enhance the human firewall and reduce the likelihood of successful cyberattacks exploiting human vulnerabilities.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization exhibits commendable technical security posture with robust MFA implementation and a seemingly secure network perimeter. However, the absence of an acceptable use policy and the lack of consistent, annual security awareness training for all employees introduce significant human-factor risks. Addressing these policy and training gaps is paramount to building a truly resilient cybersecurity defense and ensuring that employees are equipped to be the first line of defense against evolving cyber threats, rather than potential vulnerabilities.</p>
