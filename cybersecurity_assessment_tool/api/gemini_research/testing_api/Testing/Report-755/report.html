        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open SSH port (22) on a host, indicating a potential entry point that requires secure configuration. Policy review indicates several critical security gaps: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for email access or for sensitive data systems, significantly increasing the risk of account compromise and data breaches. While MFA is used for computer logins, this does not extend to all critical access points. Furthermore, the organization lacks essential security awareness training for both new and existing employees, leaving the workforce vulnerable to social engineering and phishing attacks. An additional critical vulnerability, 'Localhost Exposed', was identified, suggesting a service intended for internal use is externally accessible.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A service intended for internal access (localhost) is externally exposed on a critical port, potentially allowing unauthorized access or exploitation. This was identified by a high CVSS score (10.0) and the affected element being an IP address, indicating external accessibility.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Email MFA - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing or credential stuffing, as a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to an employee's email. Identified via organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Sensitive Data MFA - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are compromised, posing a severe risk of data breaches and regulatory non-compliance. Identified via organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Critical databases</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees nor does it provide annual training for all employees. This leaves the workforce susceptible to social engineering attacks, phishing, and other human-factor vulnerabilities, increasing the overall risk of security incidents. Identified via organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Port 22 (SSH) was found to be open on a host. While SSH is a legitimate service, an open SSH port, especially if exposed to the internet, presents a potential attack vector for brute-force attacks or exploitation of unpatched vulnerabilities in the SSH daemon. This was identified during the network scan.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with port 22 open</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately investigate and restrict external access to any 'localhost exposed' services. Implement mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and sensitive data systems to significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. Establish a comprehensive security awareness training program, including mandatory training for all new employees and annual refresher courses for the entire workforce, to educate staff on common threats like phishing and social engineering. For the open SSH port, ensure it is secured with strong authentication methods (e.g., key-based authentication, MFA), restrict access via firewall rules to only trusted IP addresses, and ensure the SSH daemon is regularly patched and updated. Regular vulnerability scanning and a robust patch management program should also be implemented across all systems.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several critical and high-severity vulnerabilities, primarily stemming from a lack of comprehensive Multi-Factor Authentication implementation across key systems (email, sensitive data) and a complete absence of security awareness training for its employees. The presence of an externally exposed 'localhost' service and an open SSH port further exacerbates the risk profile. While an acceptable use policy is in place and MFA is used for computer logins, these measures are insufficient to protect against the identified threats. Immediate action is required to address these fundamental security gaps and significantly enhance the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness.</p>
