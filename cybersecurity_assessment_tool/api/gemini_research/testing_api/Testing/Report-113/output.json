            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network scan revealed an open Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) port (3389), indicating potential external exposure. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is utilized for email access, it is not enforced for computer logins or sensitive data systems. An acceptable use policy is in place, and annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees; however, new employees do not receive initial security awareness training during onboarding.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "RDP Exposure",
                        "Overview": "Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed externally on port 3389, allowing potential attackers to attempt brute-force attacks or exploit vulnerabilities in the RDP service. This critical vulnerability was identified via an Nmap scan showing port 3389 open, indicating direct internet accessibility to the RDP service. Unauthorized access via RDP can lead to full system compromise, data exfiltration, and lateral movement within the network.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "External IP Address of the RDP server",
                            "Port 3389 (ms-wbt-server)"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "It is strongly recommended to immediately close the exposed RDP port (3389) to the internet. For secure remote access, implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution that requires multi-factor authentication for all users. Furthermore, extend multi-factor authentication requirements to all computer logins and sensitive data systems to significantly enhance access control and reduce the risk of credential-based attacks. Implement a comprehensive security awareness training program for all new employees during their onboarding process to ensure a foundational understanding of cybersecurity best practices from day one. Regularly review and update the acceptable use policy to reflect current threats and organizational security standards.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces a critical risk due to an externally exposed RDP service, which presents a significant attack vector for unauthorized access and potential system compromise. While some foundational security measures like MFA for email and annual security training are in place, there are notable gaps in MFA enforcement for computer logins and sensitive data systems, as well as the absence of initial security awareness training for new employees. Addressing these identified vulnerabilities and implementing the recommended controls is crucial to improve the overall security posture, reduce the attack surface, and enhance the organization's readiness against cyber threats."
