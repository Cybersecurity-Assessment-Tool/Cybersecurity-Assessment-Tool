        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently presents an open port 8080, which, despite being confirmed secure, initially displayed a "TOP SECRET DB" title, indicating potential exposure of sensitive systems. Internally, the organization exhibits significant gaps in its security posture, particularly concerning access controls and employee awareness. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not mandated for computer logins or access to sensitive data systems, creating critical vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the absence of an employee acceptable use policy and the lack of annual security awareness training for all staff contribute to a heightened risk of human-factor related security incidents and policy non-compliance.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Port 8080 Status - <span class="severity-Info">Info</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An initial network scan identified an open port 8080 with a title "TOP SECRET DB", suggesting a sensitive database. However, further analysis confirmed this port is secure and the finding is a false positive, indicating no immediate exploitable vulnerability.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Multi-Factor Authentication for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for employees to log into their computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are compromised through phishing, malware, or other means, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Multi-Factor Authentication for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This is a critical vulnerability, as it leaves highly sensitive information vulnerable to compromise should a single set of credentials be breached, potentially leading to data exfiltration or integrity loss.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>Critical applications</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Missing Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an established employee acceptable use policy. This absence can lead to inconsistent employee behavior regarding IT resource usage, potentially introducing security risks through misuse of company assets, unauthorized software installations, or unsafe browsing habits, without clear guidelines or consequences.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT assets</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual training for all employees. This oversight means employees may not be updated on the latest threats, best practices, or evolving company policies, leading to a degradation of security posture over time and increased susceptibility to social engineering attacks.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security culture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and, critically, for access to all sensitive data systems. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy that clearly outlines expectations for IT resource usage and data handling, including consequences for non-compliance. Establish a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees to ensure continuous education on current threats, best practices, and organizational security policies. While Port 8080 has been deemed secure, ongoing monitoring of all open ports and regular vulnerability assessments are advised to prevent future exposures.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity vulnerabilities primarily due to inadequate access controls and a lack of comprehensive security policies and training. The absence of MFA for critical systems and computer logins, coupled with the lack of an acceptable use policy and annual security awareness training, leaves the organization susceptible to various attack vectors, including credential compromise and insider threats. While the identified Port 8080 is currently secure, the overall readiness is low, necessitating immediate action to implement robust security measures and foster a stronger security culture to protect sensitive assets and maintain operational integrity.</p>
