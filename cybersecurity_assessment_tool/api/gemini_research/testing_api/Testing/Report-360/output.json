            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization currently employs Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access, which is a positive step. However, a significant lack of foundational security controls has been identified across other critical areas. Specifically, MFA is not required for computer logins or access to sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or annual training for all employees. These omissions indicate a low level of security readiness and expose the organization to various preventable risks.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Computer Logins",
                        "Overview": "Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for employees to log into their computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised, as a single factor (password) is the only barrier. The impact could range from unauthorized system access to lateral movement within the network. This was identified through organizational policy review.",

                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems",
                        "Overview": "Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not enforced for accessing systems containing sensitive data. This is a critical vulnerability, as compromised credentials could directly lead to a data breach, regulatory non-compliance, and severe reputational and financial damage. The impact is direct data exfiltration or manipulation. This was identified through organizational policy review.",

                        "Affected Elements": [

                    {
                        "Risk": "No Employee Acceptable Use Policy",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not have an employee acceptable use policy. This absence means there are no clear guidelines for employees regarding the proper use of company assets, data, and networks. This can lead to misuse of resources, increased risk of malware infections, data leakage, and legal liabilities due to inappropriate online behavior. This was identified through organizational policy review.",

                        "Risk": "No Security Awareness Training for New Employees",
                        "Overview": "New employees do not receive security awareness training. This leaves new hires vulnerable to common cyber threats such as phishing, social engineering, and malware, as they may not be aware of best practices or organizational security protocols from day one. This increases the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents. This was identified through organizational policy review.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "No Annual Security Awareness Training for All Employees",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. Regular training is crucial to keep employees updated on evolving threats and reinforce security best practices. Without it, employees' knowledge of cybersecurity can become outdated, increasing susceptibility to new attack vectors and reducing overall security posture. This was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "Organizational data and systems"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all computer logins and sensitive data systems immediately. This will provide a crucial layer of defense against credential compromise. Furthermore, the organization must develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to establish clear guidelines for responsible technology use. Concurrently, a robust security awareness training program should be established, including mandatory training for all new employees upon onboarding and annual refresher training for all existing employees to ensure continuous education on evolving cyber threats and best practices.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to the absence of critical foundational security controls. While MFA for email is a positive, the lack of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, coupled with the absence of an acceptable use policy and regular security awareness training, creates substantial vulnerabilities. These gaps expose the organization to a high risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and human-error-induced security incidents. Addressing these fundamental weaknesses is paramount to improving the overall security readiness and protecting organizational assets effectively."
