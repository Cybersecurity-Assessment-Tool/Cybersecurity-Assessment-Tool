        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan indicates an open HTTP port (80), suggesting the presence of a web server or service. A review of organizational data reveals significant security gaps, primarily a complete lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across critical access points including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or provide annual training for all employees, indicating a high human risk factor.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee inboxes through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks. A compromised email account can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and serve as a pivot point for further network penetration.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>All employee email accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MFA is not enforced for logging into organizational computers. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if user credentials are stolen, guessed, or phished. Successful compromise of a computer can lead to lateral movement within the network, installation of malware, and access to sensitive internal resources.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All organizational computers</li><li>User login systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Access to sensitive data systems does not require MFA. This is a critical vulnerability as a single compromised credential could grant an attacker full access to highly confidential information. The impact could include severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, financial penalties, and significant reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>File shares containing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not provide security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering and phishing attacks due to their unfamiliarity with organizational security policies and common threat vectors. This oversight increases the likelihood of new employees inadvertently introducing malware or compromising credentials.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>Organizational network and systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Ongoing Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. Without regular training, employees may not be updated on the latest cybersecurity threats, best practices, and organizational policies. This leads to a higher susceptibility to evolving social engineering tactics, phishing campaigns, and other human-centric attacks.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational network and systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open HTTP Port (Port 80) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A network scan identified an open HTTP port (80). While not inherently a vulnerability, an open HTTP port without proper security configurations (e.g., redirection to HTTPS, robust web application firewall) can expose web services to various risks. These include unencrypted data transmission, potential for man-in-the-middle attacks, and exploitation of underlying web server vulnerabilities if the service is outdated or misconfigured. If this service is not intended for public access, it represents an unnecessary attack surface.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Web server on port 80</li><li>Network perimeter</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, immediate implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is paramount across all critical access points, including email systems, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. This single measure will drastically reduce the risk of credential-based attacks. Concurrently, a comprehensive security awareness training program must be established, starting with mandatory training for all new employees and followed by annual refresher courses for the entire workforce to educate them on current threats and best practices. For the identified open HTTP port (80), it is recommended to assess its purpose; if public access is required, implement HTTPS with strong encryption and ensure the underlying web server and application are fully patched and securely configured. If not required, the port should be closed or restricted to authorized IP ranges.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces critical security vulnerabilities primarily due to the complete absence of Multi-Factor Authentication across key access points and a significant lack of security awareness training for its employees. These deficiencies create a high-risk environment, making the organization highly susceptible to various cyberattacks, including phishing, credential theft, and data breaches. While a single open HTTP port was identified, the human and access control vulnerabilities represent the most immediate and severe threats to the organization's readiness and data integrity.</p>
