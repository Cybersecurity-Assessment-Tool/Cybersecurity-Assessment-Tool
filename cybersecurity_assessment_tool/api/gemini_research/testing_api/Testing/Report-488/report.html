        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open port 80 (HTTP). An assessment of organizational security practices indicates a mixed security posture. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required for computer logins and annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees, there are critical gaps. Specifically, MFA is not enforced for email access or sensitive data systems, and new employees do not receive initial security awareness training.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open Port 80 (HTTP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open port 80 was detected during the network scan. This port is typically used for unencrypted HTTP traffic. If not properly secured, or if it exposes administrative interfaces or sensitive information, it can be exploited for various attacks, including data interception, unauthorized access, or web application vulnerabilities. The lack of encryption makes any data transmitted over this port vulnerable to eavesdropping.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Network perimeter</li><li>Web server (port 80)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. If an attacker gains access to an employee's email, they could potentially access sensitive information, impersonate the employee, or pivot to other systems within the organization.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee email accounts</li><li>Email system</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not enforced for accessing sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are compromised. Attackers could gain direct access to sensitive information, leading to severe consequences such as data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and significant reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts with access to sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training upon joining the organization. This means new hires may not be immediately aware of critical security policies, common threats (like phishing), or best practices, making them more susceptible to social engineering attacks and potentially introducing vulnerabilities through insecure practices from the outset.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security culture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and sensitive data systems without delay. The open port 80 should be thoroughly reviewed; if it is not essential, it should be closed, or if required, all traffic should be securely redirected to HTTPS with appropriate security configurations. Furthermore, a mandatory and comprehensive security awareness training program for all new employees must be established to ensure they are equipped with essential security knowledge and best practices from their first day. Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments should also be conducted to proactively identify and address emerging threats and ensure ongoing compliance.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several significant security vulnerabilities, primarily stemming from the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for email and sensitive data systems, which presents a critical risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches. The presence of an open HTTP port 80 also requires immediate attention and remediation. While the organization demonstrates some positive security practices, such as MFA for computer logins and annual security training, the identified gaps indicate a moderate to high overall risk posture. Addressing these critical vulnerabilities is paramount for enhancing the organization's resilience against cyber threats and safeguarding its valuable assets.</p>
