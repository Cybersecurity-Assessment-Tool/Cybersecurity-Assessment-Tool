        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a strong security posture regarding Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins. However, a critical gap exists as MFA is not required for accessing sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization lacks essential security awareness training programs for both new hires and existing employees on an annual basis. While a network scan identified an open port 8080 with a 'TOP SECRET DB' title, this has been assessed as a false positive and is considered secure.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are compromised, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for entry. This vulnerability was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees are not provided with security awareness training. This leaves them vulnerable to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) and unaware of organizational security policies and best practices from the start, increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network security</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. Regular training is crucial to keep employees updated on evolving threats, reinforce security best practices, and maintain a strong security posture. Lack of such training can lead to outdated knowledge and increased susceptibility to modern cyber threats. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Overall security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open Port 8080 (False Positive) - <span class="severity-Info">Info</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Nmap scan identified an open port 8080 with the title 'TOP SECRET DB'. However, further assessment has confirmed this port is securely configured and the initial finding is a false positive. No immediate action is required. This was identified via network scanning and subsequent assessment.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems. This will provide a crucial layer of defense against unauthorized access. Concurrently, establish a comprehensive security awareness training program that includes mandatory training for all new employees upon onboarding and annual refresher training for all existing staff. These training programs should cover current threat landscapes, phishing recognition, data handling best practices, and organizational security policies. No action is required for Port 8080 as it has been confirmed secure.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently exhibits a mixed state of cybersecurity readiness. While strong in some areas like MFA for email and computer logins, critical vulnerabilities exist due to the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems and a complete lack of security awareness training for employees. Addressing these high and medium severity risks through the recommended implementations of MFA and robust training programs is paramount to fortifying the organization's defenses against common cyber threats and improving overall security readiness.</p>
