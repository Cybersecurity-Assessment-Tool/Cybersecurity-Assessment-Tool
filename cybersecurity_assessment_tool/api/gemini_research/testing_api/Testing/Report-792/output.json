            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization currently employs Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems, and has an acceptable use policy in place. However, critical gaps exist in endpoint security and employee training. Specifically, MFA is not mandated for computer logins, and there is a complete absence of both initial security awareness training for new employees and recurring annual training for all staff. These omissions significantly elevate the risk of unauthorized access via compromised credentials and human-error-induced security incidents.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Logins",
                        "Overview": "Without MFA, user credentials (username/password) are a single point of failure. If compromised, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to internal systems and data, facilitating lateral movement and potential data breaches. This vulnerability was identified directly from the organizational policy data indicating no MFA requirement for computer logins.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employee computers",
                            "Internal network access",
                            "User accounts"
                        ]

                    {
                        "Risk": "Insufficient Security Awareness Training for New Employees",
                        "Overview": "New employees are often unfamiliar with an organization's specific security policies, common social engineering tactics (phishing, pretexting), and data handling best practices. The absence of initial training leaves them vulnerable to manipulation and makes them potential entry points for attackers, increasing the risk of human error-induced breaches. This was identified from the organizational data stating no security awareness training for new employees.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All new employees",
                            "Organizational data",

                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of Regular Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "Without annual security awareness training, employees may forget best practices, become complacent, or remain unaware of evolving threats (e.g., new phishing techniques, ransomware trends). This significantly increases the organization's susceptibility to social engineering attacks, malware infections, and insider threats due to human error. This was identified from the organizational data stating no annual security awareness training for all employees.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "Organizational data",
                            "Network security"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication for all computer logins to enhance endpoint security and prevent unauthorized access from compromised credentials. Furthermore, a comprehensive security awareness training program should be established. This program must include mandatory initial training for all new employees, covering essential security policies, threat identification, and safe computing practices. Additionally, annual refresher training should be provided to all employees to ensure ongoing awareness of evolving threats and reinforce secure behaviors. Regular updates to training content are crucial to address new attack vectors and maintain a resilient security posture.",
            "Conclusion": "While the organization has taken positive steps by implementing MFA for email and sensitive data systems and establishing an acceptable use policy, its overall security readiness is significantly hampered by critical vulnerabilities. The lack of MFA for computer logins and the complete absence of a structured security awareness training program (both for new hires and annually for all staff) expose the organization to a high risk of credential compromise, social engineering attacks, and data breaches stemming from human error. Addressing these fundamental gaps is paramount to improving the organization's defense against prevalent cyber threats and fostering a more secure operational environment."
