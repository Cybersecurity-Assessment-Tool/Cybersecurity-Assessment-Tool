        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed a single open port, 443, running Nginx version 1.18.0, indicating a web server presence. While the network footprint appears minimal from the scan, the organizational data highlights significant internal security posture weaknesses. Critically, the organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access, computer logins, or access to sensitive data systems. This lack of MFA across key access points presents a substantial risk. On a positive note, the organization has an acceptable use policy and conducts security awareness training for new employees and annually for all staff, which are good foundational practices, but these are undermined by the absence of MFA.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee inboxes through credential stuffing, phishing, or brute-force attacks. A compromised email account can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and serve as a pivot point for further network penetration. This vulnerability was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>All employee email accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for logging into organizational computers. This policy leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if user credentials are stolen, guessed, or compromised. Attackers gaining access to a computer can perform lateral movement, install malware, exfiltrate data, or disrupt operations. This vulnerability was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All organizational computers</li><li>User login accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing systems containing sensitive data. This is a critical security gap, as a single compromised credential could grant an attacker direct access to confidential information. Such a breach could result in severe data loss, regulatory non-compliance, significant financial penalties, and irreparable reputational damage. This vulnerability was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All sensitive data systems</li><li>Associated user accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Nginx Web Server Software - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A network scan identified an Nginx web server running version 1.18.0 on port 443. This version is outdated and may contain known vulnerabilities that have been addressed in newer releases. Running outdated software increases the attack surface, making the server susceptible to exploits such as denial-of-service attacks, information disclosure, or even remote code execution, potentially compromising the web service and underlying system. This vulnerability was identified via network scan data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Web server on port 443</li><li>Nginx 1.18.0</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, the immediate implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is paramount. MFA should be mandated for all email access, computer logins, and especially for all systems handling sensitive data. This single measure will drastically reduce the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials. Additionally, the Nginx web server should be updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities and improve overall security. Regular patch management for all software and operating systems is crucial. While security awareness training is in place, it should be reinforced with specific emphasis on the importance of MFA and identifying phishing attempts that target credentials.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication across critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. This lack of a fundamental security control leaves the organization highly vulnerable to credential-based attacks and subsequent data breaches. Furthermore, the presence of outdated web server software introduces additional, exploitable weaknesses. While security awareness training and an acceptable use policy are positive elements, they are insufficient to mitigate the high-severity risks posed by the lack of MFA and unpatched software. Urgent action is required to implement MFA and update critical systems to improve the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness.</p>
