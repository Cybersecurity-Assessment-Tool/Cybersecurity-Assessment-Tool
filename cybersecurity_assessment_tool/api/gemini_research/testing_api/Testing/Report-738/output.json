            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to security awareness and policy enforcement, with an acceptable use policy in place and regular security awareness training for all employees, including new hires. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is implemented for email and sensitive data systems, which is a positive security measure. However, MFA is not required for computer logins, representing a potential area for improvement in access control. A network scan identified a potential vulnerability related to an unencrypted web server, specifically with port 80.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Unencrypted Web Server",
                        "Overview": "An unencrypted web server was identified, with port 80 found to be open. This exposes web traffic to potential eavesdropping and interception, allowing attackers to view sensitive information transmitted over the network. The presence of an open, unencrypted port 80 indicates a lack of secure communication protocols for web services.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Port 80"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is recommended to immediately close port 80 if it is not essential for operations. For long-term security, implement SSL/TLS encryption for all web services to ensure secure communication. Furthermore, it is strongly advised to extend multi-factor authentication requirements to include computer logins for all employees. This will significantly enhance access control and reduce the risk of unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised.",
            "Conclusion": "Overall, the organization has a foundational security posture with good practices in employee training and policy enforcement, and partial implementation of MFA. The primary areas for immediate improvement include securing web server communications by addressing the unencrypted web server vulnerability and enhancing access control by implementing MFA for computer logins. Addressing these points will significantly strengthen the organization's defense against common cyber threats and improve its overall readiness."
