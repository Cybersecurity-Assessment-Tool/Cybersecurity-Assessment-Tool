        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open SSH port (22), indicating potential remote access capabilities. While the organization has an acceptable use policy and conducts annual security awareness training for all employees, there are significant gaps in its multi-factor authentication (MFA) implementation, specifically for email and computer logins. Furthermore, new employees do not receive initial security awareness training, which could expose the organization to social engineering risks. MFA is currently only required for sensitive data systems.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Without MFA, email accounts are highly susceptible to credential stuffing, phishing, and brute-force attacks. A compromised email account can lead to further breaches, data exfiltration, and business email compromise (BEC) scams. This was identified by the organization's self-reported policy.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Not requiring MFA for computer logins significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or guessed. This can lead to lateral movement within the network, data access, and system compromise. This was identified by the organization's self-reported policy.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers</li><li>Network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees are often the most vulnerable to social engineering attacks (phishing, pretexting) due to a lack of familiarity with organizational security policies and common threats. Without initial security awareness training, they may inadvertently introduce malware, fall for scams, or expose sensitive information. This was identified by the organization's self-reported policy.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port (Port 22) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH port (22) on a host, while necessary for remote administration, presents a potential attack surface. If not adequately secured with strong authentication (e.g., key-based authentication, MFA) and regularly patched, it can be vulnerable to brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, and exploitation of software vulnerabilities, leading to unauthorized remote access. This was identified via network scan data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with open port 22</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and computer logins. This will drastically reduce the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials. Additionally, a comprehensive security awareness training program should be established for all new employees, covering common threats like phishing and social engineering, to ensure they are equipped with essential security knowledge from day one. The open SSH port (22) identified in the network scan should be thoroughly reviewed to ensure it is secured with strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., SSH keys, MFA if supported), restricted to necessary IP addresses, and kept up-to-date with the latest security patches to prevent exploitation.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several significant security risks, primarily stemming from a lack of comprehensive Multi-Factor Authentication implementation across critical access points like email and computer logins, and a gap in initial security awareness training for new hires. While some foundational security practices are in place, these vulnerabilities represent considerable entry points for attackers. Addressing these issues proactively is crucial for improving the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and protecting its assets from potential breaches.</p>
