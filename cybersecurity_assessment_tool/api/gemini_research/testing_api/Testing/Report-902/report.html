        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network assessment reveals several critical security weaknesses. An Nmap scan identified an FTP server running an outdated version of vsftpd (2.3.4) that allows anonymous access, posing a significant risk of unauthorized data access and system compromise. Furthermore, internal policy review indicates a lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for both email and sensitive data systems, leaving these critical access points vulnerable to password-based attacks. The organization also lacks an acceptable use policy and does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees, which can lead to human error and policy violations. Finally, workstations are running unsupported Windows 7 operating systems, exposing them to numerous unpatched vulnerabilities.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Anonymous FTP Access - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An FTP server (vsftpd 2.3.4) is configured to allow anonymous login, which can lead to unauthorized access to files and potential data breaches or system compromise. This was identified via an Nmap scan.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>FTP Server (vsftpd 2.3.4)</li><li>Port 21</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated FTP Software - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The FTP server is running vsftpd version 2.3.4, which is an old version known to have multiple vulnerabilities, including a backdoor vulnerability (CVE-2011-2523). Running outdated software increases the risk of exploitation. Identified via Nmap service detection.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>FTP Server (vsftpd 2.3.4)</li><li>Port 21</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing or brute-force attacks, as a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to an employee's email. Identified from organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email System</li><li>Employee Accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if a password is compromised, increasing the risk of data breaches and compliance violations. Identified from organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive Data Systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy (AUP). Without a clear AUP, employees may be unaware of their responsibilities regarding company IT resources, potentially leading to misuse, security incidents, and legal liabilities. Identified from organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Organizational Policy</li><li>Employee Conduct</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Annual Security Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, annual training for all employees is not conducted. This means employees may not be updated on the latest threats, best practices, or organizational policies, increasing the likelihood of falling victim to social engineering attacks or making security errors over time. Identified from organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee Security Awareness</li><li>Organizational Training Program</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Windows Operating Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Workstations are running Windows 7, which has reached its end-of-life and no longer receives security updates from Microsoft. This exposes these systems to known and newly discovered vulnerabilities, making them highly susceptible to malware, exploits, and compromise. Identified from current risks data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations running Windows 7</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, immediate action is required. The FTP server should be secured by disabling anonymous access, updating vsftpd to a current, supported version, or decommissioning it if not essential. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and sensitive data systems to significantly enhance access security. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to guide appropriate conduct and reduce internal risks. Establish a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees to ensure ongoing education on current threats and best practices. Finally, all workstations running Windows 7 must be upgraded to a currently supported operating system, such as Windows 10 or 11, to receive critical security updates and patches.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks stemming from outdated software, critical misconfigurations, and gaps in security policies and training. The presence of an anonymous and outdated FTP server, coupled with the absence of MFA for email and sensitive data, creates easily exploitable entry points for attackers. Furthermore, the use of unsupported operating systems and a lack of comprehensive security awareness and policy enforcement leave the organization vulnerable to a wide range of threats, from data breaches to system compromise. Addressing these vulnerabilities promptly is crucial to improving the overall security posture and readiness against cyberattacks.</p>
