        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network assessment revealed an open port 8080, explicitly labeled as 'TOP SECRET DB', indicating a critical exposure of potentially highly sensitive data. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required for email access, it is notably absent for computer logins and sensitive data systems, creating significant authentication vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not provide security awareness training for new employees, although annual training is conducted for all staff. These gaps suggest a moderate to high overall risk posture, with a critical immediate threat identified.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed 'TOP SECRET DB' on Port 8080 - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A network scan identified an open port 8080 with a service title 'TOP SECRET DB'. This indicates a critical exposure of potentially highly sensitive data or a system managing such data. Direct exposure of a service explicitly labeled 'TOP SECRET DB' on an open port presents an immediate and severe risk of unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or compromise. This was identified via Nmap's http-title script.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li><li>Service running on Port 8080</li><li>TOP SECRET DB</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication for logging into computers. This leaves employee workstations vulnerable to unauthorized access through credential theft (e.g., phishing, brute-force attacks) as only a single factor (password) is required for authentication. The impact is potential lateral movement within the network and access to internal resources. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Authentication systems</li><li>Active Directory/LDAP (if applicable)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Access to sensitive data systems within the organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication. This significantly elevates the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access to critical and confidential information. If an attacker compromises a single set of credentials, they could gain direct access to sensitive data without an additional layer of security. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases containing sensitive information</li><li>Cloud storage for sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy. Without a clear AUP, employees may be unaware of their responsibilities regarding the proper use of company IT assets, data handling procedures, and prohibited activities. This can lead to increased risks of data leakage, malware infections, compliance violations, and insider threats due to unintentional or malicious misuse of resources. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Organizational policies</li><li>Employee conduct</li><li>IT asset usage</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees are not provided with security awareness training during their onboarding process. This leaves new hires susceptible to common social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) and unaware of the organization's specific security protocols and best practices from the outset. This increases the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employee onboarding process</li><li>Employee education program</li><li>Human resources procedures</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediate action is required to address the critical exposure on port 8080; the 'TOP SECRET DB' service should be secured, investigated, or shut down without delay. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and sensitive data systems to significantly enhance access control and mitigate credential-based attacks. Develop and enforce a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy to clearly define employee responsibilities and acceptable conduct regarding IT resources. Integrate mandatory security awareness training into the new employee onboarding process to ensure all staff are equipped with essential security knowledge from day one. Continue the existing annual security awareness training for all employees to maintain a strong security culture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces critical vulnerabilities, most notably the direct exposure of a 'TOP SECRET DB' service on an open port. Significant gaps in access control, specifically the absence of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, coupled with a lack of foundational policies like an Acceptable Use Policy and initial security training for new hires, indicate a substantial risk of data breaches and unauthorized access. While some security measures are in place (MFA for email, annual training), the identified critical and high-severity risks require urgent attention to improve the organization's overall security posture and readiness against cyber threats.</p>
