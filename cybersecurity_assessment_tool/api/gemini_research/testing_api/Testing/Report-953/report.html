        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open RDP port (3389) with the ms-wbt-server service running, indicating direct exposure of Remote Desktop Protocol. While the organization has implemented MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, and has an acceptable use policy and new employee security training, there are notable gaps. Specifically, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for email access, and annual security awareness training for all employees is not conducted.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>RDP Exposure - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is directly exposed to the internet, as identified by an open port 3389 during the network scan. This allows potential attackers to attempt brute-force attacks or exploit RDP vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to internal systems. The impact could range from unauthorized access to data breaches or system compromise.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks. If an attacker gains access to an employee's email, it could lead to further internal compromise, data exfiltration, or business email compromise (BEC) scams. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email System</li><li>User Accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. This leaves employees vulnerable to evolving social engineering tactics, phishing attempts, and other cybersecurity threats. A lack of regular training can lead to human error being a primary vector for successful attacks, impacting data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All Employees</li><li>Organizational Security Posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately close the exposed RDP port (3389) and implement secure access methods such as a VPN for remote access. Furthermore, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) should be mandated for all email access to prevent account compromise. The organization must also establish and enforce a policy for mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees to ensure continuous education on current threats and best practices. Long-term, consider implementing a robust vulnerability management program to regularly scan for and address exposed services and other vulnerabilities.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces critical security risks, primarily due to an exposed RDP service and significant gaps in its security posture, including the absence of MFA for email and a lack of annual security awareness training for all employees. While some foundational security measures are in place, these critical vulnerabilities and policy weaknesses leave the organization highly susceptible to cyberattacks, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, and operational disruption. Addressing these issues promptly is crucial for improving overall cybersecurity readiness.</p>
