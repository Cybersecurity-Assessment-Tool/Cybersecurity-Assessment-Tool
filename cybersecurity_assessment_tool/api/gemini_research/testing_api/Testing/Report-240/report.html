        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to multi-factor authentication (MFA) across critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. This significantly enhances protection against unauthorized access. However, the assessment identified critical gaps in foundational security policies and new employee onboarding processes, specifically the absence of an acceptable use policy and dedicated security awareness training for new hires. While annual security training is conducted for all employees, the initial period for new employees represents a heightened risk due to a lack of immediate security education and clear behavioral guidelines.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy. This absence means there are no clear guidelines for employees regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, data, and internet access. This can lead to misuse of company assets, increased risk of data breaches, introduction of malware, and legal liabilities due to unauthorized or inappropriate activities. The risk was identified through the organizational data provided, which explicitly stated the absence of such a policy.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Company data</li><li>Organizational reputation</li><li>Legal compliance</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient New Employee Security Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct dedicated security awareness training for new employees. While annual training is provided for all employees, new hires are particularly vulnerable to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) and may not be aware of company-specific security protocols and best practices from day one. This significantly increases the risk of human error leading to security incidents, data loss, or unauthorized access during their initial employment period. The risk was identified through the organizational data provided, which indicated no security awareness training for new employees.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Company data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li><li>Email systems</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately develop and implement a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy. This policy should clearly outline expectations for employee conduct regarding IT asset usage, data handling, and internet browsing, and be communicated to all existing and new employees. Concurrently, a mandatory security awareness training program specifically tailored for new employees should be established. This training should be delivered as part of the onboarding process, covering essential security best practices, common threats like phishing, and the organization's specific security protocols, ensuring new hires are security-aware from their first day. Regular review and updates of both the policy and training content are also advised to adapt to evolving threat landscapes.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization has a commendable stance on multi-factor authentication, which forms a strong barrier against common access threats. However, the absence of an Employee Acceptable Use Policy and dedicated security awareness training for new employees represents significant vulnerabilities. These gaps expose the organization to increased risks of human error, policy violations, and potential security breaches. Addressing these foundational policy and training deficiencies is crucial for enhancing the overall cybersecurity readiness and fostering a robust security culture within the organization.</p>
