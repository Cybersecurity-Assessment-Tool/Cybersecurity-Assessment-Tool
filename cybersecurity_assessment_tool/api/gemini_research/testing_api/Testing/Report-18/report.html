        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, demonstrating a foundational security measure. An acceptable use policy is also in place. However, MFA is not required for accessing sensitive data systems, and there is a complete absence of security awareness training for both new and existing employees. A recent assessment identified a potential unencrypted web server, indicating a risk of data exposure, despite network scan data showing port 80 as closed.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unencrypted Web Server - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Port 80 is open. This indicates that an unencrypted web server might be exposed, allowing sensitive data to be transmitted in plain text, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. This was identified by detecting an open port 80.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediate action should be taken to verify the status of Port 80 and, if confirmed open, it must be closed or secured with SSL/TLS encryption for all web traffic. The organization should extend MFA requirements to all sensitive data systems to significantly enhance access control and prevent unauthorized access. Furthermore, it is crucial to establish and regularly conduct comprehensive security awareness training for all new employees and annually for the entire workforce to foster a security-conscious culture and mitigate human-factor risks.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has taken positive steps by implementing MFA for email and computer access and having an acceptable use policy, significant vulnerabilities persist. The potential exposure of an unencrypted web server, coupled with critical gaps in MFA coverage for sensitive data and the complete lack of security awareness training, indicates a moderate to high overall risk posture. Addressing these identified areas is paramount to improving the organization's cybersecurity readiness and resilience against potential threats.</p>
