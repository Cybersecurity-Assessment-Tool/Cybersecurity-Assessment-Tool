        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan identified an active FTP server running vsftpd 2.3.4 with anonymous login enabled. From an organizational standpoint, MFA is utilized for email and sensitive data systems, but not for computer logins. An acceptable use policy is in place, and annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees, though new employees do not receive specific training upon onboarding.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Windows Operating System - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Computers are running Windows 7, which has reached end-of-life and no longer receives security updates. This exposes the workstations to known vulnerabilities and potential exploits, significantly increasing the risk of compromise. Identified via internal assessment data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Anonymous FTP Access Enabled - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The FTP server (vsftpd 2.3.4) allows anonymous login, which means unauthorized users can access and potentially modify files on the server without authentication. This poses a significant data breach risk and could be used for malware distribution or data exfiltration. Identified via Nmap scan script 'ftp-anon'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>FTP Server (vsftpd 2.3.4)</li><li>Port 21</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No MFA for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or guessed, as a single factor (password) is the only barrier. Identified via organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee Workstations</li><li>Login Systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate New Employee Security Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive specific security awareness training upon onboarding. This leaves them vulnerable to social engineering attacks, phishing, and other common threats during their initial period, potentially introducing risks to the organization before they understand security protocols. Identified via organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New Employees</li><li>Organizational Security Posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediately disable anonymous FTP access; if FTP functionality is required, implement secure alternatives like SFTP or FTPS with strong authentication and ensure the server software is regularly patched. Upgrade all workstations running Windows 7 to a currently supported operating system (e.g., Windows 10 or 11) to ensure ongoing security updates. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins across the organization to enhance credential security. Establish a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees as part of their onboarding process, covering essential security practices and common threats. Furthermore, regularly conduct vulnerability scans and penetration tests to proactively identify and address emerging risks, and ensure all software and operating systems are kept up-to-date with the latest security patches.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a mixed security posture. While MFA is utilized for email and sensitive data, critical vulnerabilities exist, including an exposed FTP server with anonymous access, outdated operating systems on workstations, and a lack of MFA for computer logins. Additionally, the absence of security awareness training for new employees presents a human factor risk. Addressing these identified risks is crucial to significantly improve the overall security readiness and reduce the attack surface.</p>
