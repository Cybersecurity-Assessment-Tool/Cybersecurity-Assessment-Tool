        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The network scan data provided is minimal, indicating no immediate open ports or services were identified on the scanned hosts. However, this limited technical insight does not reflect the overall security posture. A review of organizational data reveals significant gaps in foundational security practices, particularly concerning multi-factor authentication, employee policies, and security awareness training. These procedural and policy weaknesses represent a substantial risk to the organization's data and systems, regardless of the technical scan results.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for email access. This critical vulnerability leaves email accounts highly susceptible to compromise through credential stuffing, phishing, or brute-force attacks. A compromised email account can serve as a gateway for business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and further penetration into the network, leading to significant financial and reputational damage. This was identified through the 'Org Data' indicating 'No' for MFA on email.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>All employee email accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MFA is not required for logging into computers within the organization. This exposes all workstations and potentially connected network resources to unauthorized access if user credentials are stolen, guessed, or phished. Attackers gaining access to a single computer can perform lateral movement, access sensitive data, and deploy malware, significantly impacting operational continuity and data integrity. This was identified through the 'Org Data' indicating 'No' for MFA on computer login.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All organizational computers</li><li>User login accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Access to sensitive data systems does not require MFA. This is a critical security flaw, as a single compromised credential could grant an attacker unfettered access to confidential information, intellectual property, or personally identifiable information (PII). Such a breach could lead to severe regulatory penalties, legal liabilities, and irreparable damage to the organization's reputation. This was identified through the 'Org Data' indicating 'No' for MFA on sensitive data systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems (e.g., CRM, ERP, HR systems, financial databases)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without a clear AUP, employees may unknowingly engage in activities that introduce security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive data. This absence of formal guidelines increases the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents and makes it difficult to enforce consistent security practices. This was identified through the 'Org Data' indicating 'No' for an acceptable use policy.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational IT assets</li><li>Data handling procedures</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering and phishing attacks due to their unfamiliarity with organizational security protocols and common threats. This lack of initial training leaves them unprepared to identify and report suspicious activities, significantly increasing the risk of successful attacks that leverage human vulnerabilities. This was identified through the 'Org Data' indicating 'No' for security awareness training for new employees.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Annual Security Awareness Training for All Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not provide annual security awareness training for all employees. Without regular, updated training, employees' knowledge of current cyber threats and best practices can degrade over time. This makes the organization more susceptible to evolving threats such as advanced phishing campaigns, ransomware, and social engineering tactics, as employees may fail to recognize or properly respond to new attack vectors. This was identified through the 'Org Data' indicating 'No' for annual security awareness training.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, immediate action is required across several key areas. Firstly, implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. This single measure will drastically reduce the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials. Secondly, develop and formally implement a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) that clearly outlines expected behavior regarding IT asset usage, data handling, and internet browsing. This policy should be communicated to all employees and regularly reviewed. Thirdly, establish a robust security awareness training program. This must include mandatory training for all new employees upon onboarding, covering common threats and organizational security protocols. Furthermore, conduct annual refresher training for all employees to keep them informed about evolving cyber threats and best practices. These foundational steps will build a stronger human firewall and reduce the organization's overall attack surface.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the provided network scan data did not reveal immediate technical vulnerabilities, the organization's current readiness is severely compromised by critical gaps in its security policies and employee training. The absence of Multi-Factor Authentication across key access points (email, computer login, sensitive data systems) and the lack of an Acceptable Use Policy, coupled with no security awareness training for both new and existing employees, expose the organization to a high risk of data breaches, unauthorized access, and operational disruption. Addressing these fundamental weaknesses is paramount to establishing a secure and resilient cybersecurity posture.</p>
