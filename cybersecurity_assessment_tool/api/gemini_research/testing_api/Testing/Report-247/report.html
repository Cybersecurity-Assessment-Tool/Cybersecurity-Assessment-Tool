        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The network scan identified an open SSH port (22). Organizational data indicates that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for computer logins. While MFA is used for email and sensitive data systems, security awareness training is not conducted for new employees or annually for all employees. An employee acceptable use policy is in place.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unsecured Remote Access - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nmap scan identified an open SSH port (22). While SSH is a secure protocol, an open port presents a potential attack vector if not properly configured with strong authentication (e.g., key-based authentication, disabled password authentication) and access controls (e.g., IP whitelisting). Unauthorized access could lead to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further network penetration.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 22</li><li>Network perimeter</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Weak Authentication for Endpoints - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee workstations and potentially the internal network if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or malware. A single compromised password could grant an attacker access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers</li><li>Internal network access</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Increased Human Error Vulnerability - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires may not be familiar with the organization's security policies, common threat vectors (e.g., phishing, social engineering), or best practices for data handling. This lack of initial training makes them more susceptible to falling victim to attacks, potentially compromising organizational security.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network security</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Stagnant Security Knowledge & Practices - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. Without regular refreshers, employees' knowledge of evolving threats and security best practices can become outdated. This increases the likelihood of employees making security errors, falling for sophisticated social engineering attacks, or mishandling sensitive information, leading to potential breaches.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network security</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Implement strict access controls for the open SSH port (22), including IP whitelisting, disabling password authentication in favor of strong key-based authentication, and ensuring regular patching and monitoring of the SSH server. Consider changing the default SSH port. Mandate Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins across the organization to significantly enhance endpoint security. Establish a comprehensive security awareness training program that includes mandatory training for all new employees during onboarding and annual refresher training for all existing employees, covering topics such as phishing, social engineering, password hygiene, data handling, and incident reporting. Conduct regular network vulnerability scans and penetration tests to identify and remediate new vulnerabilities proactively.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates some foundational security practices, such as requiring MFA for email and sensitive data systems and having an acceptable use policy. However, significant vulnerabilities exist, particularly concerning endpoint authentication (lack of MFA for computer logins) and human factors (absence of comprehensive security awareness training for new and existing employees). The open SSH port also presents a potential entry point if not rigorously secured. Addressing these critical areas will substantially improve the organization's overall security posture and readiness against common cyber threats.</p>
