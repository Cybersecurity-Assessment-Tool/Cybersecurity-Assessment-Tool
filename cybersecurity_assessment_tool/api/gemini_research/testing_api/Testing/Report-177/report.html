        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed a critical exposure: an open port 8080 hosting a service explicitly titled 'TOP SECRET DB'. This indicates a severe risk of unauthorized access to highly sensitive information. While the organization implements MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, it lacks MFA for email access, which is a significant vulnerability. Furthermore, there is no employee acceptable use policy in place, and annual security awareness training for all employees is not conducted, leaving the organization susceptible to human-factor risks and policy non-compliance.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed Sensitive Database on Port 8080 - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An Nmap scan identified an open port 8080 with the HTTP title 'TOP SECRET DB'. This indicates a critical database or application server is directly accessible on the network, potentially without adequate authentication or authorization controls. The explicit labeling as 'TOP SECRET DB' suggests the presence of highly sensitive information, making this an extreme risk for data breaches, intellectual property theft, and severe reputational damage if compromised.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li><li>Service: TOP SECRET DB</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Missing MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly elevates the risk of email account compromise through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks. A compromised email account can serve as a gateway for further internal phishing, Business Email Compromise (BEC) scams, or unauthorized password resets for other critical services.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Organizational email system</li><li>Employee email accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. Without a clear AUP, employees may be unaware of their responsibilities regarding the proper use of company IT resources, data handling procedures, and internet usage. This absence can lead to misuse of company assets, increased risk of malware infections, potential data leakage, and difficulties in enforcing security standards or achieving regulatory compliance.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Data handling procedures</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This gap means that existing employees may not be regularly updated on the latest cybersecurity threats, evolving best practices, or changes in company security policies. Human error remains a primary cause of security incidents, and consistent, up-to-date training is vital for maintaining a strong and resilient security culture.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All existing employees</li><li>Organizational security culture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediate action is required to address the critical exposure of the 'TOP SECRET DB' on port 8080. This system must be secured by implementing strong authentication (preferably MFA), restricting network access to only authorized personnel and systems, and ensuring robust authorization controls are in place. Furthermore, the organization should promptly implement MFA for all email access to mitigate the high risk of account compromise. To strengthen the overall security posture, it is recommended to develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy and establish a program for mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees, covering current threats and best practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces a critical cybersecurity risk due to the direct exposure of a 'TOP SECRET DB' on an open network port. This, combined with significant gaps in MFA for email, the absence of an acceptable use policy, and insufficient ongoing security awareness training, indicates a moderate to high overall risk posture. While some security measures like MFA for computer logins are in place, the identified vulnerabilities require immediate and decisive action to prevent potential data breaches, maintain operational integrity, and foster a more secure environment.</p>
