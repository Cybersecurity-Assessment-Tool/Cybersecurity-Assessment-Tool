        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network includes an FTP server running vsftpd 2.3.4, which is configured to allow anonymous login. A significant security gap exists with the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, workstations are running Windows 7, an end-of-life operating system, posing substantial security risks. While the organization has an acceptable use policy and conducts security awareness training for both new and existing employees annually, these procedural controls are undermined by severe technical vulnerabilities.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Anonymous FTP Login Allowed - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The FTP server (vsftpd version 2.3.4) is configured to allow anonymous login. This configuration can lead to unauthorized access to files, potential data leakage, or even server compromise if write permissions are misconfigured. The vulnerability was identified through an Nmap scan detecting an open FTP port with anonymous login enabled.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>FTP server (vsftpd 2.3.4)</li><li>Port 21</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email, logging into computers, or accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access in the event of credential theft or compromise, as a single factor (password) is the sole barrier to entry across critical systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email systems</li><li>User login systems</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Windows Policy - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Workstations within the organization are running Windows 7, an operating system that has reached its end-of-life. This means it no longer receives security updates, making these systems highly susceptible to known vulnerabilities, malware infections, and potential system compromises. The risk was identified through an internal assessment of workstation operating systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately disable anonymous FTP access on the vsftpd server. If FTP functionality is essential, transition to secure alternatives such as SFTP or FTPS with robust authentication mechanisms, and ensure the vsftpd software is regularly patched and updated. A critical priority is the implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, to significantly enhance credential security. All workstations running Windows 7 must be upgraded to a currently supported operating system, such as Windows 10 or 11, to ensure they receive vital security updates. A long-term strategy should include a hardware refresh cycle to support newer operating systems. While the existing acceptable use policy and annual security awareness training are positive steps, these technical vulnerabilities must be addressed to build a robust security posture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to an insecure FTP configuration, a widespread lack of Multi-Factor Authentication, and the continued use of end-of-life operating systems on workstations. While foundational elements like security awareness training and an acceptable use policy are in place, they are insufficient to protect against the severe technical vulnerabilities identified. Addressing these critical issues is paramount to improving the organization's overall security readiness and reducing its exposure to potential cyber threats.</p>
