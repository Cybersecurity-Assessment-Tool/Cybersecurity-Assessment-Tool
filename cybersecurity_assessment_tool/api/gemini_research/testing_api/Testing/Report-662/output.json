            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network currently presents several critical and high-severity vulnerabilities. A network scan revealed an outdated FTP server (vsftpd 2.3.4) allowing anonymous login, posing a significant data exposure risk. Internally, workstations are running Windows 7, an end-of-life operating system, leaving them highly vulnerable to exploits. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is in place for email and computer logins, it is notably absent for sensitive data systems, creating a critical access control gap. Furthermore, the organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy, which can lead to inconsistent security practices. On a positive note, the organization conducts security awareness training for new employees and annually for all staff.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Anonymous FTP Login & Outdated vsftpd",
                        "Overview": "The network scan identified an FTP server running vsftpd version 2.3.4, which is an outdated version known to have security vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the server allows anonymous FTP login, enabling unauthorized users to access files without authentication. This poses a significant risk of data exposure, unauthorized file uploads, or potential server compromise.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "FTP server (vsftpd 2.3.4 on port 21)"

                    {
                        "Risk": "Outdated Operating System (Windows 7)",
                        "Overview": "Several workstations are identified as running Windows 7. This operating system has reached its end-of-life and no longer receives security updates or patches from Microsoft. This leaves these systems highly susceptible to known vulnerabilities and emerging threats, making them easy targets for malware, ransomware, and other cyberattacks.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Workstations"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive data systems. This means that if an attacker compromises a user's credentials (e.g., through phishing or brute force), they can gain direct access to critical data without an additional layer of security. This significantly elevates the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Sensitive data systems"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy",
                        "Overview": "The organization currently lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines on the appropriate use of company IT resources, employees may inadvertently engage in risky behaviors, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive information. This increases the likelihood of security incidents, data loss, and compliance violations.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "IT systems",
                            "network infrastructure"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately disable anonymous access on the FTP server and update vsftpd to a current, supported version, or consider migrating to a more secure file transfer protocol like SFTP or FTPS. All workstations running Windows 7 must be upgraded to a currently supported operating system (e.g., Windows 10 or 11) to ensure they receive critical security updates. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to add a crucial layer of security against unauthorized access. Furthermore, develop and formally implement an employee acceptable use policy to establish clear guidelines for IT resource usage and enhance overall security posture. Continue the existing security awareness training programs to reinforce best practices among all employees.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to critical vulnerabilities stemming from outdated software (Windows 7 and vsftpd) and a lack of MFA for sensitive data systems. The absence of an acceptable use policy also introduces potential human-factor risks. While security awareness training is a positive step, these fundamental technical and policy gaps severely impact the organization's overall security readiness. Addressing these critical and high-severity issues promptly is essential to prevent potential data breaches, system compromises, and maintain a robust security posture."
