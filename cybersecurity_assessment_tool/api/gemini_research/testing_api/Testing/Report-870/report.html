        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, alongside regular security awareness training for all employees and an acceptable use policy. A recent network scan identified an active host with port 80 observed as closed. However, a prior assessment highlighted a potential vulnerability related to an unencrypted web server on port 80, indicating a possible discrepancy or a recent change in the network configuration. A key area for improvement is the lack of MFA for sensitive data systems.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unencrypted Web Server - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A previous assessment identified that Port 80 is open, indicating a web server running without encryption. This exposes data transmitted over this port to interception and eavesdropping, compromising data confidentiality. While recent scan data shows port 80 as closed, the prior finding suggests a potential vulnerability that requires further investigation to confirm its current status or to understand any recent changes in the environment.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is recommended to first reconcile the conflicting information regarding Port 80; if an unencrypted web server is indeed present, immediately implement SSL/TLS encryption to secure data transmission. As an easy fix, ensure port 80 is closed if no unencrypted web services are intended. For long-term security, all web services should utilize HTTPS. Furthermore, it is critical to extend Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) requirements to all sensitive data systems to significantly enhance access control and reduce the risk of unauthorized access.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization has established a solid baseline for cybersecurity readiness with MFA for email and computer access, coupled with robust security awareness training and an acceptable use policy. However, the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems represents a significant security gap. The discrepancy regarding the unencrypted web server on Port 80 highlights the need for continuous monitoring and reconciliation of vulnerability assessment findings with real-time network scan data to ensure an accurate and up-to-date security posture.</p>
