            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, which is a positive security measure. However, MFA is not required for accessing sensitive data systems, which poses a significant risk. The organization has an acceptable use policy in place but lacks security awareness training for both new and existing employees, indicating a gap in human-centric security controls. Network scans indicate that while no web server is currently exposed on port 80, the provided risk assessment highlights a potential misconfiguration or past finding related to an unencrypted web server.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Unencrypted Web Server",
                        "Overview": "This risk indicates the presence of a web server accessible via unencrypted HTTP on Port 80. Transmitting data over unencrypted HTTP can expose sensitive information to eavesdropping and tampering, compromising data confidentiality and integrity. This was identified through a security assessment.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Port 80"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access. For the unencrypted web server risk, if Port 80 is indeed open, it should be immediately closed or redirected to an HTTPS-only service. All web traffic should be encrypted using SSL/TLS certificates to protect data in transit. Furthermore, the organization must establish and regularly conduct security awareness training for all employees, including new hires, to educate them on common threats like phishing, social engineering, and secure data handling practices. This will significantly strengthen the human firewall against cyberattacks.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing MFA for email and computer access and having an acceptable use policy. However, critical gaps exist in securing sensitive data systems without MFA and a complete absence of security awareness training. The potential for an unencrypted web server further highlights areas requiring immediate attention. Addressing these vulnerabilities, particularly through comprehensive training and consistent MFA implementation, is crucial for enhancing the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and reducing its attack surface."
