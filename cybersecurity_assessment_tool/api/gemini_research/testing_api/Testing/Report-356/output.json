            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network currently presents several critical security gaps. A host was identified with an open HTTP port (80), indicating unencrypted web traffic. Furthermore, the organization lacks Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for both email access and sensitive data systems, significantly increasing the risk of credential compromise and unauthorized data access. While MFA is utilized for computer logins, this single positive is overshadowed by the absence of an employee acceptable use policy and a complete lack of security awareness training for both new and existing employees. These deficiencies collectively expose the organization to a high risk of cyberattacks, data breaches, and operational disruptions.",

                        "Overview": "An open port 80 was identified, indicating an unencrypted HTTP web service is running. This allows for the transmission of data in plain text, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attacks, and potential data interception.

                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of email account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing, potentially leading to business email compromise (BEC) and data exfiltration.

                        "Overview": "Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are compromised, posing a severe risk of data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and reputational damage.

                        "Overview": "The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines on appropriate use of company IT resources, employees may inadvertently or intentionally engage in risky behaviors, increasing the likelihood of security incidents, data leakage, and legal liabilities.

                        "Overview": "New employees do not receive security awareness training. This leaves them unprepared for common cyber threats like phishing, social engineering, and malware, making them potential weak links in the organization's security posture from day one.

                        "Risk": "Lack of Regular Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This means employees may not be updated on the latest threats, best practices, and company policies, leading to a degradation of security knowledge over time and increased susceptibility to evolving cyberattacks. This was identified through organizational data.",
                        "Severity": "High",

                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement HTTPS for all web services, especially those exposed externally, to ensure data encryption in transit. Mandate Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and sensitive data systems to significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access. Develop and enforce a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) to establish clear guidelines for IT resource usage. Crucially, establish and regularly conduct security awareness training for all employees, including a mandatory session for new hires and annual refreshers for existing staff, to foster a strong security culture and educate against evolving threats. Finally, regularly scan the network for open ports and services, ensuring only necessary services are exposed and properly secured.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization exhibits significant security vulnerabilities, particularly concerning authentication mechanisms for critical systems (email, sensitive data) and a general lack of security awareness and policy enforcement. While MFA is used for computer logins, its absence in other high-risk areas, coupled with an unencrypted web service and no security training or AUP, creates a substantial attack surface. Addressing these gaps is crucial for improving the overall security posture and reducing the risk of data breaches and operational disruptions. Immediate action on these recommendations is advised to enhance the organization's readiness against cyber threats."
