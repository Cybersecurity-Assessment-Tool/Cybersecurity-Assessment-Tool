        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a mixed security posture. Positive aspects include the implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, as well as annual security awareness training for all employees. An acceptable use policy is also in place. However, critical vulnerabilities and significant gaps exist, particularly the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems and a lack of security awareness training for new employees. A network scan identified an open SSH port (22) and a critical 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability, indicating potential external exposure of internal services.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A critical vulnerability identified as 'Localhost Exposed' indicates that internal services or interfaces meant for local access are accessible externally. This could allow attackers to bypass network segmentation and directly interact with internal systems, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or system compromise. The impact is severe, as it exposes internal infrastructure to the public internet. This was identified through a security assessment.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information, even if an attacker compromises user credentials. Without MFA, a single compromised password could lead to a major data breach, impacting data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive Data Systems</li><li>User Accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient New Employee Security Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees are not provided with security awareness training upon joining the organization. This leaves them vulnerable to common social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) and unaware of organizational security policies and best practices from day one. Untrained employees can inadvertently introduce malware, expose credentials, or violate data handling policies, posing a significant risk to the organization's security posture. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New Employees</li><li>Organizational Security Posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port Exposure - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH (Secure Shell) port (22) was detected on a host within the network. While SSH is a legitimate service for remote administration, an open port presents a potential attack vector if not properly secured. Attackers can attempt brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or exploit known SSH vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to the system. The impact could range from unauthorized access to full system compromise. This was identified via an Nmap network scan.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host with open port 22</li><li>SSH Service</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediate action is required to address the 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability by ensuring internal services are not externally accessible and implementing strict network segmentation and firewall rules. Mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be implemented for all access to sensitive data systems to significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access. A comprehensive security awareness training program should be established for all new employees as part of their onboarding process, covering topics like phishing, social engineering, and organizational policies. For the open SSH port (22), review its necessity; if required, secure it with strong authentication (SSH keys), disable root login, restrict access via firewall rules to trusted IPs, and ensure the SSH server software is regularly patched and updated. Continue with annual security awareness training for all employees and regularly review and update security policies to align with current threat landscapes.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization exhibits a foundational commitment to cybersecurity with existing MFA for general access and annual training. However, the presence of a critical 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability, the lack of MFA for sensitive data systems, and the absence of initial security training for new employees represent significant security gaps. The open SSH port also poses a potential risk. Addressing these identified vulnerabilities and implementing the recommended mitigations is crucial to elevate the organization's overall cybersecurity posture, enhance its readiness against sophisticated threats, and protect its critical assets and data.</p>
