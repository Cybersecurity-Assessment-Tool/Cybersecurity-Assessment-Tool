        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes a MySQL database (version 5.7.33) via port 3306, which is open to the network. Furthermore, a review of organizational data reveals significant gaps in foundational security practices. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for email access or computer logins, although it is used for sensitive data systems. The organization also lacks an employee acceptable use policy and does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or annually for all staff. These combined factors indicate a low level of security readiness and a high exposure to various cyber threats.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network, exposing the database service (MySQL 5.7.33). This direct exposure increases the risk of unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or denial-of-service attacks if vulnerabilities in the MySQL service are exploited. The vulnerability was identified through network scanning.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Email Account Compromise Risk - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of email account compromise through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks, potentially leading to data breaches, business email compromise (BEC) scams, and unauthorized access to sensitive information. Identified from organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Endpoint Compromise Risk - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or guessed, potentially leading to lateral movement within the network, installation of malware, and access to sensitive systems. Identified from organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network endpoints</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Policy Enforcement Gap - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This absence can lead to inconsistent employee behavior regarding IT resource usage, increasing the risk of security incidents, data leakage, and non-compliance with regulations due to a lack of clear guidelines. Identified from organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Organizational policies</li><li>Employee conduct</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Human Factor Vulnerability - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or annually for all employees. This leaves employees susceptible to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) and unaware of best security practices, significantly increasing the risk of successful cyberattacks that exploit human vulnerabilities. Identified from organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted internal IP addresses or via a secure VPN. Furthermore, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) should be mandated for all email access and computer logins to significantly reduce the risk of credential-based attacks. The organization must develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to establish clear guidelines for IT resource usage. Crucially, a robust security awareness training program should be established, including mandatory training for all new employees and annual refresher training for all staff, to educate them on common cyber threats and best security practices. Consideration should also be given to upgrading the MySQL version to the latest stable release to benefit from security patches.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces a high level of cybersecurity risk due to an exposed database service and critical deficiencies in fundamental security controls. The absence of MFA for key access points, coupled with a lack of essential security policies and employee training, creates a significant attack surface. Immediate action is required to implement the recommended technical and procedural controls to enhance the organization's security posture and improve its overall readiness against cyber threats.</p>
