            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network currently exposes an Nginx web server (version 1.18.0) on port 443 (HTTPS). A review of organizational practices indicates several critical security gaps. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for email access, computer logins, or sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. While new employees receive security awareness training, this training is not conducted annually for all employees, leaving a significant gap in ongoing security education.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for critical access points including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. This significantly elevates the risk of unauthorized access, as compromised credentials (e.g., through phishing or brute-force attacks) could grant attackers full access without an additional layer of security. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data provided.",

                        "Risk": "Outdated Web Server Software",
                        "Overview": "The Nginx web server running on port 443 is identified as version 1.18.0. This version is outdated and may contain known security vulnerabilities that have been addressed in newer releases. Exploiting such vulnerabilities could lead to various attacks, including denial of service, information disclosure, or potentially remote code execution. This was identified via network scan data.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                    {
                        "Risk": "Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy",
                        "Overview": "The organization currently lacks an established employee acceptable use policy. This absence creates ambiguity regarding the appropriate use of company resources, data handling procedures, and internet usage. Without clear guidelines, there is an increased risk of accidental or intentional misuse of company assets, potential data breaches, and non-compliance with industry regulations. This was identified through the organizational data provided.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Insufficient Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct this training annually for all employees. This leaves the workforce vulnerable to evolving social engineering tactics, phishing attacks, and general human error, as employees may not be regularly updated on the latest threats and best practices. This was identified through the organizational data provided.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "Email systems",
                            "Data handling"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. The Nginx web server should be updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities and ensure optimal security. Furthermore, the organization must develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to establish clear guidelines for resource usage and data handling. Finally, a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees should be established to ensure continuous education on evolving cyber threats and best practices.",
            "Conclusion": "The current cybersecurity posture of the organization presents significant vulnerabilities, primarily due to the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication, the use of outdated software, and critical gaps in security policies and ongoing employee training. These issues collectively expose the organization to a high risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and operational disruption. Immediate and comprehensive action is required to address these findings and significantly enhance the overall security readiness."
