            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network scan revealed an open Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) port (3389), indicating a direct exposure to potential external threats. While the organization demonstrates a strong commitment to security awareness training for all employees and utilizes MFA for email and sensitive data systems, a critical gap exists in not requiring MFA for computer logins. This combination, particularly with an exposed RDP service, significantly elevates the risk of unauthorized access and system compromise.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "RDP Exposure",
                        "Overview": "Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) port 3389 was found to be open and exposed to the internet. This allows potential attackers to attempt brute-force attacks or exploit vulnerabilities in the RDP service to gain unauthorized access to internal systems. Gaining access via RDP could lead to full system compromise, data exfiltration, and lateral movement within the network. This vulnerability was identified through network scanning.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Port 3389 on target IP"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the critical RDP exposure, it is strongly recommended to immediately close port 3389 to external access. For legitimate remote access needs, implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution, ensuring all remote connections are routed through the VPN with strong authentication. Furthermore, address the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. Implementing MFA for all computer access, especially for systems accessible via RDP, will add a crucial layer of security against credential theft and unauthorized access attempts. Regularly review network configurations and conduct vulnerability scans to identify and remediate similar exposures proactively.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces a critical security vulnerability due to an exposed RDP service, which significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access. While the organization has commendable practices in security awareness training and MFA for certain systems, the absence of MFA for computer logins exacerbates the risk associated with the RDP exposure. Addressing these critical points is paramount to enhancing the overall security posture and readiness against cyber threats."
