        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan identified at least one active host with an open SSH (port 22) service. While the organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems, it lacks MFA for computer logins. An acceptable use policy is in place, and security awareness training is provided for new employees, but annual security awareness training for all employees is not conducted.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Without MFA for computer logins, an attacker who compromises a user's credentials (e.g., via phishing or brute-force) can gain unauthorized access to internal systems and data without an additional layer of authentication. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and lateral movement within the network, as a single compromised password could grant full system access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>User accounts</li><li>Workstations</li><li>Servers requiring login</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The absence of regular, annual security awareness training for all employees leaves the organization vulnerable to social engineering attacks (phishing, vishing, pretexting) and other human-factor risks. Employees may not be up-to-date on the latest threats, best practices for data handling, or how to identify and report suspicious activities, increasing the likelihood of successful attacks that bypass technical controls.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network security</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed SSH Service - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH (port 22) service, if not properly secured, can be a target for brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or exploitation of SSH vulnerabilities. While SSH is a secure protocol, misconfigurations such as weak passwords, root login enabled, or outdated software can lead to unauthorized access to the host, potentially providing a direct entry point into the network.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Host(s) with open port 22</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication for all computer logins to significantly reduce the impact of compromised credentials. Additionally, a comprehensive annual security awareness training program should be established for all employees to educate them on current threats and best security practices, thereby strengthening the human firewall. For the exposed SSH service, ensure it is configured securely by disabling password authentication in favor of key-based authentication, restricting access via firewall rules to only necessary IP addresses, and regularly patching the SSH server software to address known vulnerabilities.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of cybersecurity by implementing MFA for sensitive systems and providing initial security training. However, critical gaps exist in access control for computer logins and ongoing employee security education, which present significant attack vectors. The presence of an open SSH port also warrants immediate attention to prevent unauthorized access. Addressing these vulnerabilities will substantially improve the organization's overall security posture and readiness against common cyber threats.</p>
