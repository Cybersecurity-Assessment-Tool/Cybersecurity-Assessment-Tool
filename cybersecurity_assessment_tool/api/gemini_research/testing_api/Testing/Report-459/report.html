        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, demonstrating a commitment to identity and access management for these critical areas. However, MFA is not required for accessing sensitive data systems, which presents a significant security gap. Additionally, the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy, which can lead to inconsistent security practices and increased risk. Security awareness training is conducted for new employees and annually for all employees, which is a positive step in fostering a security-conscious culture. The network scan revealed an open MySQL port (3306) on an active host, indicating a potential database exposure.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network. This exposes the database service to potential unauthorized access, brute-force attacks, or exploitation of known MySQL vulnerabilities. If compromised, sensitive data stored in the database could be exfiltrated, modified, or destroyed, leading to data breaches, operational disruption, and reputational damage. The vulnerability was identified through a network port scan revealing an open port 3306.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306 (easy fix). For a long-term solution, consider placing the database behind a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or within a segmented network accessible only by authorized systems. Furthermore, it is crucial to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised. The organization should also develop and enforce an employee acceptable use policy to establish clear guidelines for secure behavior and data handling, thereby reducing human-related risks.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security through MFA for email and computer logins, and regular security awareness training. However, significant vulnerabilities exist, particularly the exposed MySQL database and the lack of MFA for sensitive data systems. The absence of an acceptable use policy further highlights areas for improvement in governance. Addressing these critical risks by securing the database, extending MFA coverage, and establishing clear policies is paramount to enhancing the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and readiness against potential threats.</p>
