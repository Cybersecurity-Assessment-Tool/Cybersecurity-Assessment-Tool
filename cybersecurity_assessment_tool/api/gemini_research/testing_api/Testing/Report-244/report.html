        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network infrastructure appears to be well-secured at a basic level, with no open ports identified during the network scan. However, a review of organizational data reveals significant vulnerabilities related to access control. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required for sensitive data systems, it is notably absent for email access and computer logins. On a positive note, the organization has an employee acceptable use policy and conducts security awareness training for both new and existing employees annually, indicating a foundational commitment to security awareness.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. Email is a critical communication channel and a frequent target for phishing attacks. Without MFA, a compromised password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's email account, potentially leading to sensitive information exposure, impersonation, or further access to other linked systems via password resets. This vulnerability was identified through the provided organizational security posture data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>All employee email accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This presents a significant risk, as a successful credential compromise (e.g., via phishing or malware) could allow an attacker to gain direct access to an employee's workstation and, subsequently, the internal network. This increases the likelihood of unauthorized access, lateral movement within the network, and potential data exfiltration or system compromise. This vulnerability was identified through the provided organizational security posture data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee workstations</li><li>Network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and computer logins. This will add a crucial layer of security, making it substantially harder for attackers to gain unauthorized access even if they obtain user passwords. Furthermore, continue to enforce the existing employee acceptable use policy and maintain regular security awareness training to ensure employees remain vigilant against evolving threats. While the network scan showed no immediate external vulnerabilities, continuous monitoring and regular vulnerability assessments are advised.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a mixed state of cybersecurity readiness. While foundational security awareness and policy enforcement are in place, and the external network appears robust, the absence of MFA for critical access points like email and computer logins represents a significant and high-severity vulnerability. Addressing these MFA gaps is paramount to mitigating the risk of credential-based attacks and unauthorized access, thereby substantially improving the overall security posture and readiness against modern cyber threats.</p>
