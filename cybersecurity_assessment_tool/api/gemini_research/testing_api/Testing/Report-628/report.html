        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The network scan indicated no immediately discoverable open ports on the external perimeter, suggesting a potentially secure external posture or limited external exposure. However, an assessment of organizational policies revealed several critical internal security gaps related to access control, employee conduct, and ongoing security education.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. Compromised email accounts can lead to further internal network breaches, data exfiltration, and business email compromise (BEC) scams. This vulnerability was identified through the review of organizational security policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li><li>Organizational data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if a single factor (e.g., password) is compromised. Attackers gaining access to these systems could exfiltrate, modify, or destroy sensitive information, leading to severe data breaches, regulatory fines, and reputational damage. This vulnerability was identified through the review of organizational security policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>Critical applications</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. Without a clear AUP, employees may be unaware of their responsibilities regarding the use of company IT resources, data handling, and internet usage. This can lead to increased risks of data leakage, malware infections, non-compliance with regulations, and legal liabilities due to inappropriate or unauthorized activities. This vulnerability was identified through the review of organizational security policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee workstations</li><li>Network resources</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Organizational reputation</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual training for all employees. This means that existing employees may not be updated on the latest threats, best practices, and organizational policies, leading to a degradation of security awareness over time. This increases the likelihood of successful social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing), malware infections, and human error-related incidents. This vulnerability was identified through the review of organizational security policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational network</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Endpoints</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and sensitive data systems immediately. This critical step will significantly enhance protection against credential-based attacks. Furthermore, the organization should develop and enforce a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) to clearly define expected behavior and responsibilities regarding IT resource usage. Finally, a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees should be established to ensure continuous education on evolving cyber threats and best security practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently exhibits a mixed security posture. While the external network scan did not reveal immediate vulnerabilities, the internal policy review indicates significant weaknesses. The absence of MFA for email and sensitive data systems, coupled with the lack of an Acceptable Use Policy and insufficient annual security awareness training, exposes the organization to a range of high to critical risks, primarily stemming from human factors and credential compromise. Addressing these policy and training gaps is paramount to improving overall cybersecurity readiness and protecting critical assets.</p>
