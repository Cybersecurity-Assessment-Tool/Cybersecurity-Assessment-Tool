        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open MySQL port (3306) running version 5.7.33, indicating a potential database exposure. On the positive side, the organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, which significantly enhances identity and access management. However, critical gaps were identified in security policies and training: the organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy, and there is no security awareness training for new employees or annual training for all employees. These policy and training deficiencies present significant human-factor risks.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network. This exposes the database to potential unauthorized access, data breaches, and denial-of-service attacks if not properly secured. The presence of an open port was identified via an Nmap scan showing port 3306 (MySQL) in an 'open' state.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li><li>MySQL Database Server</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not have an employee acceptable use policy. This absence creates a significant risk as employees may unknowingly or intentionally misuse company resources, engage in unsafe online behaviors, or introduce security threats without clear guidelines. This lack of policy makes it challenging to enforce proper conduct and protect organizational assets. Identified via organizational data indicating no such policy exists.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All Employees</li><li>Company Resources</li><li>Organizational Security Posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No New Employee Security Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often unfamiliar with the organization's specific security protocols, common cyber threats, and best practices, making them highly susceptible to phishing, social engineering, and other initial compromise vectors. This significantly increases the risk of security incidents originating from new personnel. Identified via organizational data indicating no training for new hires.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New Employees</li><li>Organizational Security Posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Annual Security Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. Regular and ongoing training is crucial to keep employees updated on evolving cyber threats, reinforce security best practices, and maintain a strong security-aware culture. The lack of annual training can lead to complacency, outdated knowledge, and increased susceptibility to advanced and emerging threats over time. Identified via organizational data indicating no annual training.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All Employees</li><li>Organizational Security Posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted internal IP addresses or via a secure VPN. Furthermore, the organization should develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to clearly define expectations for resource usage and online behavior. Mandatory security awareness training programs must be established for all new employees upon onboarding, and annual refresher training should be conducted for all existing employees to ensure ongoing vigilance against evolving threats. While MFA is a strong control, its effectiveness can be undermined by human error or social engineering if employees are not adequately trained. Leverage the existing MFA implementation across all critical systems and ensure its consistent application.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a strong foundation in identity and access management through its widespread use of MFA. However, this strength is significantly undermined by critical vulnerabilities, including an exposed database service and, more importantly, substantial gaps in security policies and employee training. The absence of an acceptable use policy and comprehensive security awareness training (for both new and existing employees) creates a high risk of human-factor incidents, which can lead to data breaches, system compromises, and operational disruptions. Addressing these policy and training deficiencies, alongside securing the exposed database, is paramount to improving the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and readiness against modern threats.</p>
