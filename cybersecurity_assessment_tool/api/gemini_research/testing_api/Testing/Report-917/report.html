        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open RDP port (3389), indicating potential exposure to external threats. From a policy perspective, the organization requires Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and computer logins, and conducts annual security awareness training for all employees. However, critical gaps exist, including the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems, a lack of an employee acceptable use policy, and no security awareness training specifically for new employees.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>RDP Exposure - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed to the internet via an open port (3389). This allows potential attackers to attempt brute-force attacks or exploit RDP vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to internal systems. This critical vulnerability was identified through a network port scan.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>IP address with open port 3389</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if credentials are compromised, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication. This was identified through a review of organizational security policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy. This absence can lead to employees engaging in risky online behaviors, misuse of company resources, or unintentional security breaches due to a lack of clear guidelines on appropriate system and network usage. This was identified through a review of organizational policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational network and systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Incomplete Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive security awareness training upon joining the organization. This leaves new hires vulnerable to common social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) and unaware of critical security protocols, potentially making them an easy target for initial access to the organization's network. This was identified through a review of organizational training programs.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately close the exposed RDP port (3389) and implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) for secure remote access. Furthermore, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be enforced for all sensitive data systems to prevent unauthorized access. The organization should develop and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to guide appropriate system usage and reduce insider risks. Crucially, a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees should be established to ensure they are equipped with essential cybersecurity knowledge from day one. Regular, annual security awareness training for all employees should continue as currently practiced.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces critical security vulnerabilities, primarily due to an exposed RDP service, which presents a significant attack surface. While MFA is in place for email and computer logins, the lack of MFA for sensitive data systems, absence of an acceptable use policy, and incomplete security awareness training for new hires indicate significant gaps in the overall security posture. Addressing these issues is paramount to enhancing the organization's readiness against cyber threats and protecting its critical assets.</p>
