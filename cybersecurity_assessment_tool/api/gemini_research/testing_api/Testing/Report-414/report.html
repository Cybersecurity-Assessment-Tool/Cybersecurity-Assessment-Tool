        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization operates with a host that is currently online. A network scan indicated that port 80 is closed. From an organizational policy standpoint, the company has implemented strong security measures including Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, an employee acceptable use policy is in place, and security awareness training is conducted for both new hires and all employees annually. However, a key area of concern identified is the lack of MFA for email access.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing employee email accounts. This significantly elevates the risk of unauthorized access to email through various attack vectors such as phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks. A compromised email account can serve as a gateway for attackers to pivot into internal systems, exfiltrate sensitive data, or launch Business Email Compromise (BEC) scams. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational security posture questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li><li>Organizational data</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>It is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts across the organization. This can be achieved by enabling MFA features provided by your email service provider or integrating with a dedicated identity and access management (IAM) solution. This measure will significantly enhance the security posture against unauthorized access and mitigate the risks associated with compromised credentials.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization has established a commendable foundation for cybersecurity through its comprehensive policies, regular security awareness training, and the use of MFA for critical systems. However, the absence of MFA for email access presents a significant vulnerability that could be exploited by adversaries. Addressing this specific gap is crucial for bolstering the overall security posture and ensuring a higher level of readiness against evolving cyber threats.</p>
