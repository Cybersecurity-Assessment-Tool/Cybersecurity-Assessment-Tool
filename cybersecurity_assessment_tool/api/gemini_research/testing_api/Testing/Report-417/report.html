        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The network scan identified an open port 8080 with a title 'TOP SECRET DB'. However, this has been confirmed as a false positive and is considered secure. The organization's readiness is significantly hampered by several critical gaps in its security policies and training programs. Specifically, there is a widespread lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for critical access points, and a complete absence of formal security awareness training and acceptable use policies.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No MFA for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing employee email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to email accounts through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. Compromised email accounts can lead to further internal system breaches, data exfiltration, and business email compromise (BEC) scams. This was identified from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee email accounts</li><li>Email server/service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This leaves internal systems vulnerable to unauthorized access if employee credentials are stolen or guessed. Without a second factor, an attacker with valid credentials can gain direct access to workstations and potentially the internal network, leading to data breaches, malware infections, and system compromise. This was identified from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network login systems</li><li>Active Directory/identity management systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy (AUP). An AUP defines the proper use of company assets, systems, and data, setting clear expectations for employee behavior. Without such a policy, employees may unknowingly engage in activities that introduce security risks, such as installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, or mishandling sensitive data, leading to increased exposure to malware, data loss, and compliance issues. This was identified from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT assets</li><li>Data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of New Employee Security Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) as they may be less familiar with company security protocols and common threats. The absence of initial training leaves new employees unprepared to identify and respond to security threats, increasing the likelihood of human error leading to breaches or malware infections. This was identified from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Company network</li><li>Data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Annual Security Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. Regular training is crucial to keep employees informed about evolving threats, reinforce best practices, and maintain a strong security culture. Without annual training, employees may become complacent, forget previous lessons, or be unaware of new attack vectors, making the organization more susceptible to social engineering, phishing, and other human-centric attacks. This was identified from the organizational data provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company network</li><li>Data</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and computer logins immediately. This will significantly enhance protection against credential theft. Furthermore, the organization should develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to establish clear guidelines for IT asset usage. Crucially, a robust security awareness training program must be established, including mandatory training for all new employees and annual refresher training for all existing staff. These measures will collectively strengthen the organization's human firewall and reduce susceptibility to social engineering and other human-centric attacks.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the network scan revealed no immediate technical vulnerabilities, the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness is low due to significant deficiencies in foundational security practices. The absence of MFA for critical access points, coupled with a lack of security awareness training and an acceptable use policy, exposes the organization to a high risk of human error, social engineering, and unauthorized access. Addressing these policy and training gaps is paramount to improving the organization's security posture and protecting its assets.</p>
