        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network assessment revealed a critical vulnerability with an open port 8080 exposing a service titled 'TOP SECRET DB'. This indicates a severe risk of data breach and unauthorized access to highly sensitive information. Furthermore, the organization exhibits significant security posture weaknesses due to the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, which greatly increases the risk of credential compromise. A lack of an employee acceptable use policy also represents a governance gap. On a positive note, the organization does conduct security awareness training for new employees and annually for all staff.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed Sensitive Database on Port 8080 - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An Nmap scan identified port 8080 as open, revealing a service titled 'TOP SECRET DB'. This indicates a potentially highly sensitive database is directly accessible from the network, possibly without adequate authentication or encryption, posing a critical risk of data breach and unauthorized access. The presence of 'TOP SECRET DB' in the title suggests the data held within is of extreme importance and confidentiality.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li><li>TOP SECRET DB service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for email access, computer logins, or sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access through compromised credentials, as a single password breach could grant an attacker full access to critical systems and data, leading to severe operational and data integrity impacts.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email access</li><li>Computer logins</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This gap in governance means there are no formal guidelines for employees regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, potentially leading to misuse, data leakage, or introduction of malware due to unapproved software or internet usage, thereby increasing the overall attack surface.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee IT resource usage</li><li>Organizational policy framework</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediate action is required to address the critical vulnerability on port 8080; the service must be thoroughly investigated, secured with strong authentication and encryption, or removed if not intended for public exposure. It is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, to significantly enhance credential security and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access. Furthermore, the organization should develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy (AUP) to establish clear guidelines for IT resource usage and reduce internal risks. Regular, comprehensive vulnerability scans and penetration testing should be conducted to proactively identify and remediate security weaknesses.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks, primarily stemming from a critically exposed sensitive database and a widespread absence of Multi-Factor Authentication across key access points. While security awareness training is a positive measure, these fundamental technical and policy gaps leave the organization highly vulnerable to data breaches, unauthorized access, and potential operational disruption. Addressing these core vulnerabilities with immediate and strategic security enhancements is paramount to improving the overall security posture and readiness.</p>
