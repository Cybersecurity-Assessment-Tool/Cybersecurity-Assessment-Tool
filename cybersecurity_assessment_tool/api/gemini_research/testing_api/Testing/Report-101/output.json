            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network currently exposes an open RDP port (3389) on an unspecified host, posing a significant remote access risk. Internally, a critical gap exists in authentication practices, as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for email access or computer logins, though it is used for sensitive data systems. Additionally, the organization lacks a comprehensive security awareness training program for both new and existing employees, which, despite having an acceptable use policy, leaves employees vulnerable to social engineering and other threats.",

                        "Risk": "RDP Exposure",
                        "Overview": "Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed on port 3389, allowing potential unauthorized access to internal systems. This was identified via a network scan showing port 3389 as open. The impact could range from unauthorized access to system compromise and data exfiltration.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Email Access",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing or credential stuffing attacks, as a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to an employee's email, leading to further internal compromise or business email compromise (BEC) scams. This was identified through organizational policy review.",

                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Computer Login",
                        "Overview": "Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for logging into computers within the organization. This leaves employee workstations vulnerable to unauthorized access if passwords are stolen or guessed, potentially leading to lateral movement within the network, data theft, or malware deployment. This was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                    {
                        "Risk": "Insufficient Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or at least once per year for all employees. This leaves the workforce susceptible to social engineering attacks, phishing, malware, and other human-factor vulnerabilities. A lack of awareness can lead to employees unknowingly facilitating breaches. This was identified through organizational policy review.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "Organizational data and systems"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "Immediately close port 3389 to external access. For legitimate remote access needs, implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution with strong authentication, including MFA, to secure connections. Furthermore, implement and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and computer logins across the organization. Establish a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees and conduct annual refresher training for all staff, covering topics such as phishing, social engineering, password hygiene, and incident reporting. Regularly review and update security policies, including the acceptable use policy, to reflect current threat landscapes and best practices.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to an exposed RDP service and critical gaps in its authentication and employee training protocols. The absence of MFA for email and computer logins, coupled with a lack of regular security awareness training, creates a fertile ground for credential compromise and social engineering attacks. While an acceptable use policy is in place, its effectiveness is diminished without proper enforcement and employee education. Addressing these vulnerabilities is paramount to enhancing the organization's overall security posture and readiness against evolving cyber threats."
