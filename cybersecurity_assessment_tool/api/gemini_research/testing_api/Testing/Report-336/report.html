        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization currently implements Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems. However, MFA is not enforced for computer logins. Furthermore, the organization lacks a structured security awareness training program for both new and existing employees, despite having an acceptable use policy.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised through phishing, malware, or brute-force attacks. Without a second factor, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's workstation and potentially the internal network.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers</li><li>Internal network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of New Employee Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. This means new hires may not be adequately informed about common cyber threats (e.g., phishing, social engineering), organizational security policies, and best practices from day one. This oversight can lead to new employees inadvertently introducing vulnerabilities or falling victim to attacks due to a lack of awareness.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network security</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not provide annual security awareness training for all employees. Regular training is crucial to keep employees updated on evolving threats, reinforce security best practices, and maintain a strong security culture. Without periodic refreshers, employees may forget previous training, become complacent, or be unaware of new attack vectors, increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network security</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to significantly enhance protection against credential theft. Additionally, a comprehensive security awareness training program should be established. This program must include mandatory training for all new employees upon onboarding and annual refresher training for all existing employees. Training should cover topics such as phishing detection, social engineering tactics, password hygiene, and data handling best practices to foster a robust security-conscious culture.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing MFA for email and sensitive data systems and having an acceptable use policy. However, critical gaps exist in endpoint security due to the lack of MFA for computer logins and a complete absence of structured security awareness training for both new and existing employees. Addressing these vulnerabilities is paramount to strengthening the organization's overall security posture and reducing the risk of successful cyberattacks stemming from compromised credentials or human error.</p>
