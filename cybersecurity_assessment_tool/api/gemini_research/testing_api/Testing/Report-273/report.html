        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network assessment reveals several critical gaps in its security posture, primarily concerning authentication and employee training. While an acceptable use policy is in place, the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across key access points and a complete lack of security awareness training for both new and existing employees significantly elevates the risk of unauthorized access and successful social engineering attacks. The network scan identified an open port 8080 with a title 'TOP SECRET DB', however, this was confirmed as a false positive and secured.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This is a critical vulnerability as it provides a single point of failure for protecting highly confidential information. A compromised credential could grant an attacker direct access to sensitive data, leading to severe data breaches, regulatory fines, and reputational damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>Confidential information repositories</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts if credentials are compromised, leading to potential phishing attacks, data exfiltration, and business email compromise.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>All employee email accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This leaves internal systems vulnerable to unauthorized access if employee login credentials are stolen or guessed, potentially leading to lateral movement within the network and data breaches.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All organizational computers</li><li>Internal network access points</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of New Employee Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. This means new hires may not be aware of common cyber threats (e.g., phishing, social engineering) or organizational security policies, making them more susceptible to attacks and potentially introducing vulnerabilities into the network.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. Regular training is crucial to keep employees updated on evolving threats and reinforce best security practices. Without it, employees' security knowledge can degrade over time, increasing the risk of human error-related incidents.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, immediate implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is strongly recommended across all critical access points, starting with sensitive data systems, followed by email access, and then computer logins. Furthermore, a comprehensive security awareness training program must be established. This program should include mandatory training for all new employees upon onboarding and annual refresher training for all staff to ensure continuous education on evolving cyber threats and best security practices. Regular phishing simulations should also be conducted to test and improve employee vigilance.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks due to a pervasive lack of Multi-Factor Authentication and a complete absence of security awareness training. While an acceptable use policy is a positive step, it is insufficient to mitigate the identified vulnerabilities. The current readiness level is low, making the organization highly susceptible to credential-based attacks, data breaches, and human error-induced security incidents. Addressing these fundamental security gaps is paramount to protecting organizational assets and sensitive information.</p>
