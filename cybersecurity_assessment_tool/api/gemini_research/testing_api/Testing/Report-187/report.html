        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a strong foundational security posture, with comprehensive implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for critical access points including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, robust security awareness initiatives are in place, encompassing an employee acceptable use policy and regular security awareness training for all employees, including new hires. Network scanning identified one active host with an open SSH (port 22) service, indicating a potential area for enhanced security hardening.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH (Secure Shell) port (22) was detected on a host within the network. While SSH is a legitimate service for remote administration, an open port represents a potential attack surface if not adequately secured. Attackers could attempt brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or exploit known SSH vulnerabilities if the server is not properly configured, regularly patched, or if weak authentication methods are in use. This could lead to unauthorized access and compromise of the affected system.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 22</li><li>Host with open port 22</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risk associated with the open SSH port, it is strongly recommended to implement best practices for SSH security. This includes enforcing key-based authentication instead of passwords, disabling root login, implementing rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks, and restricting SSH access to only necessary IP addresses. Additionally, ensure that the SSH server software is kept up-to-date with the latest security patches. The organization should continue its excellent practices regarding MFA implementation and regular security awareness training, as these are crucial components of a strong security defense.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization exhibits a commendable level of security readiness, particularly in its widespread adoption of MFA and consistent security awareness training. These measures significantly reduce the risk of common attack vectors. The primary area for immediate improvement lies in hardening the security configuration of the identified open SSH service to prevent potential unauthorized access. Addressing this specific vulnerability will further strengthen the overall security posture and readiness against cyber threats.</p>
