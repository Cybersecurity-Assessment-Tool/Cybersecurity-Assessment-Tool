        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and access to sensitive data systems, and conducts regular security awareness training for all employees. However, a critical security gap exists in not requiring MFA for email access. Additionally, the absence of a formal employee acceptable use policy introduces potential risks related to employee conduct and data handling.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing employee email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. A compromised email account can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information, business email compromise (BEC) scams, and further lateral movement within the network.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee email accounts</li><li>Email servers</li><li>Communication channels</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). Without a clear AUP, employees may not be fully aware of their responsibilities regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, data handling, internet usage, and security best practices. This can lead to unintentional security breaches, misuse of company assets, and potential non-compliance with regulatory requirements.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT assets</li><li>Data handling procedures</li><li>Network resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all employee email accounts. This is a critical step to protect against unauthorized access and credential-based attacks. Concurrently, a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) should be developed, implemented, and communicated to all employees. This policy should clearly outline responsibilities for using company IT resources, data handling, internet usage, and security protocols. Regular training on the AUP and periodic reviews of all security policies should be established to ensure ongoing relevance and effectiveness against evolving threats. Additionally, consider conducting regular phishing simulation exercises to reinforce security awareness training related to email-based threats.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization demonstrates a good foundation in security awareness training and MFA for critical systems like computer logins and sensitive data, significant vulnerabilities exist due to the lack of MFA for email access and the absence of an acceptable use policy. Addressing these gaps is paramount to enhancing the overall security posture, reducing the risk of account compromise, and ensuring consistent employee adherence to security best practices.</p>
