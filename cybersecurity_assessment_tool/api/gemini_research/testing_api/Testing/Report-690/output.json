            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, and provides security awareness training for new employees. However, there are notable gaps in the security posture, including the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems, a lack of an employee acceptable use policy, and no annual security awareness training for all employees. A specific vulnerability identified is an unencrypted web server, despite network scan data indicating port 80 is closed. For the purpose of this assessment, the identified risk of an unencrypted web server as detailed in the 'Current Risks' input is considered active.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Unencrypted Web Server",
                        "Overview": "Port 80 is open, indicating a web server is accessible without encryption. This exposes data transmitted over this port to potential eavesdropping and interception, compromising confidentiality. This vulnerability was identified as a current risk.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if primary credentials are compromised, as there is no secondary verification layer.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Sensitive data systems"
                        ]

                    {
                        "Risk": "No Employee Acceptable Use Policy",
                        "Overview": "The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without clear guidelines, employees may engage in activities that inadvertently or intentionally compromise network security, data integrity, or compliance, leading to increased operational and security risks.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "Organizational IT resources"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. This leaves employees vulnerable to evolving cyber threats such as phishing, social engineering, and malware, as their knowledge of current security best practices may become outdated.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement SSL/TLS encryption for all web services, ensuring all traffic is served over HTTPS. If the service on port 80 is not intended to be public, it should be closed or restricted. Furthermore, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be enforced for all sensitive data systems to provide an essential layer of protection against unauthorized access. The organization should also prioritize developing and implementing a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to establish clear guidelines for IT resource usage. Finally, mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees is crucial to maintain a high level of vigilance against evolving cyber threats and reinforce secure practices.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization has a foundational security posture with MFA for email and computer logins and initial security awareness training. However, significant vulnerabilities persist, particularly the lack of MFA for sensitive data systems, the absence of an acceptable use policy, and insufficient ongoing security awareness training. The presence of an an unencrypted web server further highlights areas requiring immediate attention. Addressing these critical gaps is paramount to enhancing the overall security posture, reducing the attack surface, and improving the organization's readiness against potential cyber threats."
