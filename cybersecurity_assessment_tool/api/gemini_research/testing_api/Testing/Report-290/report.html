        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network includes an FTP server running an outdated version that allows anonymous access. Internally, the security posture is significantly weakened by the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across critical systems such as email, computer logins, and sensitive data access. Furthermore, there is a critical lack of foundational security policies, specifically an employee acceptable use policy, and no regular security awareness training for employees. A significant portion of the workstation fleet is running Windows 7, an end-of-life operating system, posing substantial unpatched vulnerability risks.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Anonymous FTP Login Allowed - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The FTP service (vsftpd 2.3.4) on port 21 allows anonymous login. This can lead to unauthorized access to files, data leakage, or even arbitrary file uploads if not properly configured, posing a significant risk to data confidentiality and integrity. The service version is also outdated.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>FTP Server (vsftpd 2.3.4)</li><li>Port 21</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for email access, computer logins, or sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised, as a single factor (password) is the only barrier to critical systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email systems</li><li>User login systems</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This means there are no formal guidelines for employees regarding the proper and secure use of company IT resources, increasing the risk of misuse, data breaches, and non-compliance with security best practices.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>IT systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees, nor does it provide annual training for all employees. This leaves employees vulnerable to social engineering attacks (phishing, pretexting) and unaware of best security practices, significantly increasing the risk of human error leading to security incidents.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Windows Policy - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Computers are running Windows 7, an operating system that has reached its end-of-life and no longer receives security updates from Microsoft. This exposes the workstations to known and unpatched vulnerabilities, making them highly susceptible to malware, exploits, and other cyberattacks.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediately disable anonymous FTP access and update the vsftpd service to a current, supported version, ensuring proper authentication and authorization for all FTP operations. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, as a top priority to significantly enhance credential security. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to guide secure IT resource usage. Establish and regularly conduct mandatory security awareness training for all employees, including new hires and annual refreshers, to educate them on common threats and best practices. Prioritize the upgrade of all Windows 7 workstations to a currently supported operating system like Windows 10 or 11 to mitigate risks from unpatched vulnerabilities, considering a hardware refresh if existing machines cannot support newer OS versions.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces a critical array of cybersecurity vulnerabilities stemming from both technical misconfigurations and significant policy and training gaps. The presence of an anonymous FTP server, widespread lack of MFA, use of end-of-life operating systems, and absence of fundamental security policies and training collectively indicate a low state of readiness against modern cyber threats. Addressing these issues systematically is paramount to establishing a secure operational environment and protecting organizational assets.</p>
