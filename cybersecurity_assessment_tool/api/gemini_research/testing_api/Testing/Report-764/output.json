                "Summary": "The organization's network infrastructure includes at least one host with an open HTTP service (port 80). A review of organizational security practices reveals significant gaps in identity and access management, specifically the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. While an acceptable use policy is in place and annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees, there is a critical omission of security awareness training for new employees. These findings indicate a substantial risk posture, particularly concerning credential compromise and unauthorized access.",

                        "Overview": "The organization does not require MFA for email access. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts if credentials are compromised, potentially leading to phishing attacks, data breaches, and business email compromise.",

                        "Overview": "The organization does not require MFA for logging into computers. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if local or domain credentials are stolen or guessed, potentially allowing attackers to gain a foothold within the internal network.",

                        "Overview": "The organization does not require MFA to access sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk, as compromised credentials could grant direct access to confidential information, leading to severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and reputational damage.",

                        "Risk": "No Security Awareness Training for New Employees",
                        "Overview": "While annual security awareness training is conducted, new employees do not receive initial training. This leaves new hires vulnerable to social engineering attacks, phishing, and other common threats during their initial period, as they may not be aware of organizational security policies and best practices.",

                        "Risk": "Open Port 80 (HTTP)",
                        "Overview": "The network scan identified an open port 80, indicating an active HTTP service. While not inherently a vulnerability, an unencrypted HTTP service can expose sensitive information transmitted over the network to eavesdropping. If this service is not properly secured or is running outdated software, it could be exploited for various attacks, including information disclosure, session hijacking, or web application vulnerabilities.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Web server on port 80",
                            "Network traffic"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points, including email systems, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. This is a foundational security control that significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials. Furthermore, a comprehensive security awareness training program should be established for all new employees as part of their onboarding process, ensuring they are equipped with essential security knowledge from day one. The open port 80 should be thoroughly investigated to determine the nature of the service, ensure it is running the latest patched software, and ideally, transition to HTTPS (port 443) for all web services to encrypt data in transit. If the HTTP service is not essential, it should be closed. Regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing should be conducted to identify and address further potential weaknesses.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces a high level of risk primarily due to the widespread absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and a gap in security awareness training for new employees. These deficiencies create significant avenues for attackers to gain unauthorized access to systems and sensitive data. While some foundational elements like an acceptable use policy and annual training are present, the lack of MFA and initial training for new hires represents critical vulnerabilities that must be addressed urgently to enhance the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and protect against potential breaches."
