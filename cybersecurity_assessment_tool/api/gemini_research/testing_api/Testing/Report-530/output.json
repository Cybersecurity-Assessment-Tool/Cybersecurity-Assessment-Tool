            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network currently presents several significant security vulnerabilities. An Nmap scan identified an active FTP server running vsftpd version 2.3.4, which is outdated and configured to allow anonymous login, posing a critical risk for unauthorized data access. Furthermore, an internal review of organizational policies revealed that while Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is used for email access, it is not mandated for computer logins or access to sensitive data systems, leaving these critical assets vulnerable to credential compromise. Security awareness training for new employees and annual refreshers for all staff are not conducted, increasing the risk of human-factor incidents. An acceptable use policy is in place, which is a positive step. However, workstations are still operating on Windows 7, an end-of-life operating system, which lacks current security updates and is highly susceptible to modern threats.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Anonymous FTP Access and Outdated FTP Server",
                        "Overview": "An FTP server running vsftpd 2.3.4 was discovered to allow anonymous login. This configuration permits unauthorized users to access files on the server without authentication, potentially leading to data leakage or unauthorized file uploads. The vsftpd version 2.3.4 is also significantly outdated and known to contain multiple security vulnerabilities, including a critical backdoor vulnerability (CVE-2011-2523) that could allow remote code execution. This was identified via an Nmap scan on port 21.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Critical Systems",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins or access to sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to internal networks and critical data if user credentials are stolen or compromised through phishing, malware, or other means, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication. This was identified through a review of organizational access policies.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                    {
                        "Risk": "Insufficient Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "The organization currently lacks a formal program for security awareness training for new employees and does not conduct annual refresher training for all staff. This leaves employees vulnerable to social engineering attacks such as phishing, ransomware, and other forms of malware, increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security breaches and data loss. This was identified through a review of organizational HR and training policies.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Outdated Operating System on Workstations",
                        "Overview": "Workstations within the organization are currently running Windows 7. As Windows 7 reached its end-of-life in January 2020, it no longer receives security updates, patches, or technical support from Microsoft. This makes these systems highly vulnerable to known exploits, malware, and zero-day attacks, posing a significant risk to the integrity and confidentiality of organizational data. This was identified through an internal system audit.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Workstations"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, immediate action is required across several fronts. Firstly, the anonymous access on the FTP server must be disabled immediately, and the vsftpd service should be updated to the latest secure version or replaced with a more secure file transfer protocol like SFTP or SCP. A thorough review of the FTP server's contents is also recommended to ensure no sensitive data was exposed. Secondly, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) should be implemented and enforced for all computer logins and access to sensitive data systems to significantly enhance authentication security. Thirdly, a comprehensive security awareness training program must be established, including mandatory training for all new hires and annual refresher courses for all employees, to educate staff on cybersecurity best practices and threat recognition. Finally, all workstations running Windows 7 must be upgraded to a currently supported operating system, such as Windows 10 or 11, to ensure they receive critical security updates and remain protected against modern threats. A hardware refresh plan may be necessary to support newer OS versions.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces several critical and high-severity cybersecurity risks stemming from outdated software, weak authentication practices, and a lack of comprehensive security awareness training. The presence of an anonymously accessible and outdated FTP server, coupled with the absence of MFA for critical systems and the continued use of end-of-life operating systems, creates a highly vulnerable environment. While an acceptable use policy is a foundational element, the overall security readiness is low. Addressing these vulnerabilities promptly through the recommended actions is crucial to significantly improve the organization's security posture and protect against potential cyber threats."
