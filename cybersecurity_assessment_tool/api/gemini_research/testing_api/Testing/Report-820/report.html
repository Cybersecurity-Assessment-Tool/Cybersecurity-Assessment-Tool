        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates strong foundational security practices regarding Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. This significantly enhances protection against unauthorized access. However, a critical gap exists in human-centric security controls. The absence of an employee acceptable use policy and any form of security awareness training for both new and existing employees introduces substantial risk, as human error and malicious intent are often primary vectors for cyberattacks. The network scan data indicates no immediately apparent open ports, suggesting a basic level of network perimeter hygiene, but this does not mitigate the internal risks posed by a lack of employee education and policy enforcement.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). An AUP defines the proper use of company assets, information systems, and network resources by employees. Without such a policy, there are no clear guidelines for employees regarding appropriate online behavior, data handling, software installation, and internet usage. This increases the risk of employees inadvertently or intentionally misusing company resources, introducing malware, exposing sensitive data, or engaging in activities that could lead to legal or compliance issues. This was identified through organizational data indicating the absence of this policy.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company network</li><li>Company data</li><li>IT systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not provide security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) as they may be less familiar with company policies, procedures, and common threat indicators. Without initial training, new employees are highly susceptible to falling victim to these attacks, which can lead to credential compromise, malware infection, or unauthorized access to internal systems. This significantly increases the risk of initial breach and internal compromise. This was identified through organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Email systems</li><li>Internal network</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. Cybersecurity threats are constantly evolving, and without regular, updated training, employees' knowledge and vigilance can degrade over time. This makes them more vulnerable to new phishing techniques, social engineering tactics, and other emerging threats. The lack of ongoing education means employees may not recognize current attack vectors, increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents, data breaches, or system compromises. This was identified through organizational data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company network</li><li>Email systems</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization implement a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) that clearly outlines expectations for employee conduct regarding company assets and data. This policy should be formally documented, communicated to all employees, and acknowledged by them. Furthermore, the organization must establish and enforce a robust security awareness training program. This program should include mandatory initial training for all new employees, covering fundamental cybersecurity principles, common threats like phishing and social engineering, and proper data handling. Additionally, annual refresher training should be provided to all employees to keep them informed about evolving threats and reinforce best practices, ensuring a continuously vigilant workforce.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has a commendable stance on Multi-Factor Authentication, providing a strong technical barrier against unauthorized access, its overall cybersecurity readiness is significantly hampered by critical gaps in human-centric security controls. The absence of an acceptable use policy and any form of security awareness training for both new and existing employees creates substantial vulnerabilities that could be exploited through social engineering or accidental misuse. Addressing these policy and training deficiencies is paramount to building a resilient security posture and protecting against the most common and effective attack vectors.</p>
