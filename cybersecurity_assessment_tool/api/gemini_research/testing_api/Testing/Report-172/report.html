        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The provided network scan data indicates a minimal network footprint with no open ports detected, suggesting either a highly secured and isolated environment or an incomplete scan. From an organizational perspective, the company demonstrates strong adoption of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, which is a significant positive security control. However, there are notable gaps in foundational security policies and ongoing training.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks an employee acceptable use policy. This policy is crucial for defining expected employee behavior regarding company assets, data, and network usage. Without it, employees may inadvertently engage in activities that pose security risks, such as improper use of company devices, unauthorized software installations, or visiting malicious websites, leading to potential data breaches, malware infections, or compliance violations. The absence of such a policy creates ambiguity and increases the likelihood of human error-related security incidents.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company network</li><li>Company data</li><li>Company assets</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. Cybersecurity threats evolve rapidly, and without regular, updated training, employees may not be aware of the latest phishing techniques, social engineering tactics, or emerging malware. This significantly increases the risk of employees falling victim to attacks, leading to compromised credentials, data loss, or system infections. Continuous training is vital to maintain a strong human firewall and reinforce secure practices across the organization.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company network</li><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Email systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization develop and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy. This policy should clearly outline expectations for secure behavior, data handling, and system usage, and be communicated effectively to all employees. Furthermore, the organization must establish a program for mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees. This training should be updated regularly to cover current threat landscapes, reinforce best practices, and include practical examples of common attacks like phishing and social engineering. Regular training will empower employees to recognize and report potential threats, significantly reducing the organization's overall risk posture. Additionally, while the network scan showed no open ports, it is advisable to conduct more in-depth network penetration testing to ensure there are no hidden vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization exhibits a commendable commitment to strong authentication through widespread MFA implementation. However, its overall security readiness is significantly hampered by the absence of a formal employee acceptable use policy and a lack of recurring annual security awareness training for all staff. These gaps introduce substantial human-factor risks that could lead to security incidents despite robust technical controls. Addressing these policy and training deficiencies is paramount to building a resilient security posture and protecting against evolving cyber threats.</p>
