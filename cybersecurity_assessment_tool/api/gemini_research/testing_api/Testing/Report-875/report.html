        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization exhibits a mixed security posture. While strong controls like Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) are in place for email and sensitive data systems, critical gaps exist in other areas. An Nmap scan identified an open SSH port (22), which, if not properly secured, presents a significant attack surface. Furthermore, the absence of MFA for computer logins and a lack of initial security awareness training for new employees introduce considerable human-factor and credential-based risks. A critical vulnerability related to 'Localhost Exposed' was also identified, indicating potential misconfigurations leading to unintended system exposure.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Localhost Exposed - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A critical misconfiguration has led to the unintended exposure of internal services or the system itself to external networks. This vulnerability could allow unauthorized access, information disclosure, or remote code execution, posing an extreme risk to the organization's data and infrastructure. The issue was identified through a critical vulnerability assessment, indicating a severe security flaw.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Network perimeter</li><li>Exposed IP addresses</li><li>Internal services</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Computer Login Security - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee workstations and potentially the internal network if credentials are stolen, phished, or brute-forced. A single factor (password) is insufficient to protect against modern attack techniques, making this a high-impact vulnerability identified during the organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee workstations</li><li>User accounts</li><li>Internal network access</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Exposed SSH Service - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH (Secure Shell) port (22) was detected on the network perimeter during an Nmap scan. While SSH is a legitimate service for remote administration, an exposed port without robust hardening measures (e.g., strong, unique passwords, key-based authentication, MFA, IP restrictions, rate limiting, and regular patching) presents a significant attack surface. This can lead to brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or exploitation of SSH vulnerabilities, potentially granting unauthorized remote access to the underlying system.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Network perimeter</li><li>Server hosting SSH service</li><li>Port 22</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Untrained New Hires - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees do not receive initial security awareness training upon joining the organization. This leaves them vulnerable to common social engineering attacks, phishing attempts, and malware from day one, potentially introducing significant human-factor risks. While annual training is conducted for all employees, the lack of immediate onboarding security education creates a critical window of vulnerability for new hires, identified during the organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network integrity</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately address the 'Localhost Exposed' vulnerability by reviewing network configurations, firewall rules, and service bindings to ensure no internal services are unintentionally accessible from external networks. Implement mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins to significantly enhance protection against credential theft and unauthorized access. For the exposed SSH service, implement comprehensive hardening measures including disabling password authentication in favor of key-based authentication, enforcing strong passphrase policies for keys, implementing IP-based access restrictions, enabling rate limiting, and ensuring the SSH server is regularly patched and configured with the principle of least privilege. Finally, establish and enforce a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees as part of their onboarding process, covering essential topics such as phishing, social engineering, password hygiene, and incident reporting, to reduce human-factor risks from day one.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing MFA for sensitive systems and conducting annual security awareness training. However, the presence of critical vulnerabilities, including an exposed 'localhost' service, the lack of MFA for computer logins, an unhardened open SSH port, and the absence of initial security training for new hires, indicates significant areas requiring immediate attention. Addressing these high-priority risks is crucial to elevate the organization's overall security posture and readiness against prevalent cyber threats.</p>
