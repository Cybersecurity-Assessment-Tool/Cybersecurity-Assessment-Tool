            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network appears to have at least one active host, with port 80 currently reported as closed by network scans. From an organizational policy standpoint, the company has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and conducts regular security awareness training for all employees, including new hires. However, MFA is not required for email access or sensitive data systems, and there is no formal employee acceptable use policy in place.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Unencrypted Web Server",
                        "Overview": "An unencrypted web server was identified, with port 80 reported as open. This exposes web traffic to potential eavesdropping and data interception, compromising confidentiality.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Port 80"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and sensitive data systems to enhance access control. Furthermore, a formal employee acceptable use policy should be developed and enforced to establish clear guidelines for technology usage. Regarding the unencrypted web server, the immediate action should be to close port 80 if it is not intentionally serving content. For any public-facing web services, a long-term solution involves implementing SSL/TLS encryption to secure data in transit, thereby protecting against eavesdropping and ensuring data confidentiality.",
            "Conclusion": "While the organization demonstrates a good foundation with MFA for computer logins and consistent security awareness training, significant vulnerabilities remain. The absence of MFA for email and sensitive data systems, coupled with the lack of an acceptable use policy, creates exploitable gaps in the security posture. The identified unencrypted web server further highlights a potential exposure point. Addressing these critical areas will significantly improve the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and reduce its attack surface."
