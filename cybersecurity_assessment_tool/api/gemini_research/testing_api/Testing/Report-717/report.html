        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan identified an open port 8080, which displayed a 'TOP SECRET DB' title. However, this port has been confirmed as secured or a false positive. Organizational data indicates a lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and computer logins, and an absence of regular security awareness training for both new and existing employees. While an acceptable use policy is in place and MFA is used for sensitive data systems, these gaps present significant security risks.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email. Without MFA, an attacker who compromises an employee's credentials could gain unauthorized access to their email, potentially leading to phishing attacks, data exfiltration, or further network penetration. This significantly increases the risk of account takeover and business email compromise.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee email accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This makes systems vulnerable to credential stuffing, brute-force attacks, and phishing. If an attacker obtains login credentials, they can directly access internal systems without an additional layer of security, increasing the risk of unauthorized access and lateral movement within the network.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee computers</li><li>Network endpoints</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient New Employee Security Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New employees are often the most susceptible to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) due to a lack of familiarity with organizational security policies and common threats. The absence of initial security awareness training leaves the organization vulnerable to human error-induced breaches.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Internal systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Regular Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. Without regular training, employees may not be updated on the latest threats, best practices, or organizational policies. This increases the likelihood of employees falling victim to evolving cyberattacks, leading to data breaches, malware infections, or compliance violations.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Internal systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Port 8080 Status - <span class="severity-Info">Info</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Port 8080 was identified as open during the network scan, displaying the title 'TOP SECRET DB'. However, this port has been confirmed as secured or a false positive, indicating it does not pose an immediate vulnerability.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 8080</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and computer logins. This critical step will add a robust layer of security against credential theft. Furthermore, a comprehensive security awareness training program should be established, including mandatory training for all new employees upon onboarding and annual refresher training for all existing staff. This will ensure employees are equipped to identify and mitigate common cyber threats. While Port 8080 is currently deemed secure, continuous monitoring of all open ports and services is advised to prevent future exposures.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant vulnerabilities primarily due to the absence of MFA for email and computer access, and a lack of consistent security awareness training. While some foundational elements like an acceptable use policy and MFA for sensitive data systems are in place, these critical gaps leave the organization susceptible to common and impactful cyberattacks. Addressing these areas is paramount to improving overall cybersecurity readiness and reducing the risk of a breach.</p>
