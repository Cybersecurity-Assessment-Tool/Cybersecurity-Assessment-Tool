        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently includes an FTP server running vsftpd 2.3.4, which has been identified as allowing anonymous login. Furthermore, several workstations are operating on Windows 7, an outdated and unsupported operating system. While the organization has positive security practices in place, such as an employee acceptable use policy and regular security awareness training for all employees, there are significant gaps in authentication controls. Specifically, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for accessing email, logging into computers, or accessing sensitive data systems, leaving critical assets vulnerable to credential-based attacks.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Windows Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Computers are running Windows 7, an operating system that has reached its end-of-life and no longer receives security updates from Microsoft. This exposes these workstations to known vulnerabilities and exploits, significantly increasing the risk of system compromise, data breaches, and malware infections. The risk was identified through an internal assessment.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Anonymous FTP Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An FTP server running vsftpd version 2.3.4 is configured to allow anonymous login. This configuration can lead to unauthorized access to files, potential data leakage, or even server compromise if write permissions are inadvertently enabled or if sensitive information is stored in publicly accessible directories. This vulnerability was identified via an Nmap network scan.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>FTP server (vsftpd 2.3.4 on port 21)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of email account compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing, as a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's email communications and potentially other linked services. This was identified through a review of organizational security policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No MFA for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for employees to log into their computers. This leaves workstations vulnerable to unauthorized access if passwords are stolen, guessed, or brute-forced, potentially leading to internal network compromise, lateral movement by attackers, and data exfiltration. This was identified through a review of organizational security policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive data systems. This represents a critical security gap, as a compromised single password could grant an attacker direct access to highly confidential information, leading to severe data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, financial penalties, and significant reputational damage. This was identified through a review of organizational security policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Employee accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately upgrade all workstations running Windows 7 to a currently supported operating system, such as Windows 10 or 11, to ensure they receive critical security updates. The anonymous FTP access on the vsftpd server should be disabled without delay; if FTP functionality is essential, implement secure alternatives like SFTP or FTPS with strong authentication and strict access controls. Most critically, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be implemented across all access points: for email access, for computer logins, and for all sensitive data systems. This will significantly enhance the organization's defense against credential-based attacks. The organization should continue its commendable efforts in security awareness training and acceptable use policy enforcement, reinforcing the importance of these new security measures.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several significant cybersecurity risks, including the presence of outdated operating systems, an insecurely configured FTP service, and a critical lack of Multi-Factor Authentication across key access points. While existing security awareness training and acceptable use policies are positive, they are insufficient to counter the severe threats posed by these vulnerabilities. Immediate action is required to address the critical and high-severity risks, particularly the implementation of MFA and system upgrades, to improve the overall security posture and enhance readiness against modern cyber threats.</p>
