        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization has established an employee acceptable use policy and conducts annual security awareness training for all employees. However, there are notable gaps in the implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), specifically for email access and sensitive data systems. Additionally, new employees do not receive initial security awareness training, which could leave them vulnerable to common threats during their onboarding period. No technical vulnerabilities were identified through the provided network scan data.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Email accounts are a primary target for phishing and credential stuffing attacks. Without MFA, compromised credentials can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive communications, data, and potentially other linked systems, increasing the risk of business email compromise and data exfiltration. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on email access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employee email accounts</li><li>Email server/service</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Access to systems containing sensitive organizational data without MFA significantly increases the risk of data breaches. If an attacker obtains credentials, they can directly access, modify, or exfiltrate critical organizational data, leading to severe financial, reputational, and compliance impacts. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for MFA on sensitive data systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All sensitive data systems</li><li>Databases</li><li>File shares</li><li>Cloud storage containing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees are often unfamiliar with an organization's specific security policies, common threats, and best practices. Without initial security awareness training during onboarding, they are more susceptible to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) and may inadvertently introduce risks by mishandling sensitive information or falling for scams. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'No' for security awareness training for new employees.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access and sensitive data systems. This will significantly enhance protection against credential theft and unauthorized access. Furthermore, a mandatory security awareness training program should be introduced for all new employees as part of their onboarding process to ensure they are equipped with essential security knowledge from day one. The organization should continue its annual security awareness training for all employees and regularly review and update its acceptable use policy to reflect current threat landscapes.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security through its acceptable use policy and annual security awareness training. However, critical vulnerabilities exist due to the absence of MFA for email and sensitive data systems, and a lack of initial security awareness training for new hires. Addressing these gaps is paramount to strengthening the organization's security posture, protecting sensitive data, and reducing the overall risk of successful cyberattacks.</p>
