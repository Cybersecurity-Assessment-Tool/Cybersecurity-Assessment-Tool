        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Based on the provided organizational data, the network's detailed configuration and specific vulnerabilities from network scans could not be assessed due to broken input data. However, a review of security policies indicates that the organization has implemented an employee acceptable use policy and conducts regular security awareness training for all employees, including new hires, which are positive security practices. A critical gap identified is the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and computer logins, which poses significant risks to the organization's security posture.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Email Security - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. Compromised email accounts can lead to further internal network breaches, data exfiltration, and business email compromise (BEC) scams. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee email accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Endpoint Login Security - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This leaves endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access if user credentials are stolen or guessed. Without a second factor, an attacker with valid credentials can gain direct access to internal systems, data, and potentially move laterally within the network. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All organizational computers</li><li>User accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access. This will add an essential layer of security, making it significantly harder for unauthorized users to access email accounts even if they obtain credentials. Furthermore, MFA should be mandated for all computer logins across the organization. This will protect endpoints from unauthorized access and reduce the risk of lateral movement by attackers. While the organization has good practices in place for security awareness training and acceptable use policies, these technical controls are crucial for bolstering overall security.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security through its acceptable use policy and consistent security awareness training programs. However, the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for email access and computer logins represents a critical vulnerability that significantly elevates the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Addressing these MFA gaps is paramount to enhancing the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and protecting its assets from common attack vectors.</p>
