        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization exhibits a foundational security posture, with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) in place for email and computer logins, and an acceptable use policy for employees. New hires receive initial security awareness training. A network scan indicated no open ports, suggesting a potentially well-managed external network perimeter or limited external exposure. However, critical gaps were identified in the protection of sensitive data systems and the consistency of employee security awareness training.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inadequate Multi-Factor Authentication for Sensitive Data - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive data systems. This significantly elevates the risk of unauthorized access to critical information should primary credentials become compromised through methods like phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. Without MFA, a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to sensitive data, potentially leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and severe reputational damage. This vulnerability was identified during the review of organizational security policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Inconsistent Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. While new employees receive initial training, the absence of recurring training leaves existing employees vulnerable to evolving cyber threats, including sophisticated phishing campaigns, social engineering tactics, and malware. Regular training is essential to reinforce best practices, update employees on new threats, and maintain a strong human firewall. Without it, employees are more likely to fall victim to attacks, which could lead to system compromises or data loss. This vulnerability was identified during the review of organizational security policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational IT infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems. This measure will provide a crucial additional layer of security, preventing unauthorized access even if primary credentials are compromised. Furthermore, a comprehensive and recurring security awareness training program must be established for all employees, conducted at least annually. This will ensure that the workforce is continuously updated on the latest cyber threats and best practices, thereby substantially reducing the risk of successful social engineering and phishing attacks.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the organization has implemented some commendable security practices, such as MFA for email and computer access, and initial training for new hires, the identified gaps in MFA for sensitive data systems and the lack of annual security awareness training for all employees represent significant vulnerabilities. Addressing these areas is paramount for mitigating the risk of data breaches and maintaining a robust defense against the ever-evolving landscape of cyber threats. The organization's current security readiness is moderate, with key areas requiring immediate attention to elevate the overall security posture to an acceptable level.</p>
