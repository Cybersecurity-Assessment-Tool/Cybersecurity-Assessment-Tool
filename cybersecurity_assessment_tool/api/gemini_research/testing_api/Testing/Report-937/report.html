        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The network scan identified one active host with an open port 443, indicating the presence of a web service. This service is running an Nginx web server, version 1.18.0, accessible via HTTPS. Organizational data reveals that while security awareness training is conducted for all employees, there are significant gaps in multi-factor authentication implementation and the absence of an acceptable use policy.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee email accounts if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing. Compromised email accounts can lead to further attacks, data breaches, and impersonation, serving as a common initial access vector for adversaries.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>User accounts</li><li>Employee credentials</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive data systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are stolen or guessed. A breach of these systems could result in severe data loss, regulatory fines, reputational damage, and significant operational disruption, as a single compromised password could grant full access.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li><li>Critical business data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without a clear AUP, employees may be unaware of their responsibilities regarding company IT resources, data handling, and internet usage. This can lead to misuse of company assets, increased risk of malware infections, data leakage, and non-compliance with industry regulations, as there are no formal guidelines for acceptable behavior and consequences for non-compliance.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Data handling procedures</li><li>Organizational compliance</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and sensitive data systems. This will significantly enhance protection against credential theft and unauthorized access. Furthermore, the organization should develop, disseminate, and enforce a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy to establish clear guidelines for responsible IT resource usage and data handling. Regular review and updates of all software, including the Nginx web server, should also be performed to ensure all security patches are applied and to reduce the attack surface from known vulnerabilities in outdated software.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant security risks primarily due to the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for email and sensitive data systems, and the absence of an Employee Acceptable Use Policy. While security awareness training is conducted, these foundational policy and technical controls are critical gaps that could lead to severe data breaches and operational disruptions. Addressing these vulnerabilities is paramount to improving the organization's overall security posture and readiness against modern cyber threats.</p>
