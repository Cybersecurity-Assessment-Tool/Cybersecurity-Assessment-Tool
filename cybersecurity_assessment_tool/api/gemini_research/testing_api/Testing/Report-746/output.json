                "Summary": "The organization's network includes an FTP server running vsftpd version 2.3.4, which allows anonymous login. Internally, the organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access or computer logins, though it is used for sensitive data systems. There is no employee acceptable use policy in place, and while new employees receive security awareness training, annual training for all employees is not conducted. Furthermore, workstations are running an outdated operating system, Windows 7.",

                        "Overview": "The organization does not require MFA for email access. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing or brute-force attacks, as a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's email.

                        "Overview": "While new employees receive security awareness training, annual training for all employees is not conducted. This results in a degradation of security knowledge over time, making employees more susceptible to social engineering attacks, phishing, and other human-factor vulnerabilities.

                        "Risk": "Outdated Operating System (Windows 7)",
                        "Overview": "Workstations are running Windows 7, an operating system that has reached its end-of-life and no longer receives security updates from Microsoft. This leaves systems highly vulnerable to known and newly discovered exploits, significantly increasing the risk of malware infection and system compromise. Identified via internal risk assessment.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "Immediately disable anonymous FTP access and upgrade vsftpd to the latest stable version or replace it with a more secure file transfer solution (e.g., SFTP, SCP). Implement mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and computer logins across the organization to significantly enhance authentication security. Develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy. Establish a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees to maintain a high level of security posture. Prioritize upgrading all workstations running Windows 7 to a currently supported operating system like Windows 10 or 11. If immediate upgrades are not feasible, isolate these systems from the main network and implement strict compensating controls.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization faces significant cybersecurity risks stemming from critical vulnerabilities in its FTP server, including anonymous access and outdated software. Furthermore, a lack of fundamental security controls such as Multi-Factor Authentication for email and computer logins, the absence of an acceptable use policy, and insufficient annual security awareness training expose the organization to a wide range of threats. The continued use of end-of-life operating systems like Windows 7 on workstations further exacerbates the risk profile, leaving the organization highly susceptible to data breaches, system compromises, and operational disruptions. Immediate action is required to address these critical and high-severity findings to improve the overall security posture."
