        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exhibits several critical security weaknesses. While an acceptable use policy is in place and new employees receive security awareness training, there are significant gaps in foundational security practices. Specifically, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not enforced for computer logins or access to sensitive data systems, leaving these critical access points vulnerable to credential compromise. Furthermore, annual security awareness training for all employees is not conducted, which can lead to a decline in security posture over time. Network scans revealed an active FTP server running an outdated version of vsftpd (2.3.4) with anonymous login enabled, posing a direct risk of unauthorized data access and potential system compromise. Additionally, workstations are identified as running an outdated Windows operating system (Windows 7), which is no longer supported with security updates, making them highly susceptible to known vulnerabilities.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Anonymous FTP Access and Outdated FTP Server - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An FTP server running vsftpd version 2.3.4 on port 21 was found to allow anonymous login. This configuration permits unauthorized users to access, and potentially modify or exfiltrate, data stored on the FTP server without authentication. vsftpd 2.3.4 is also an outdated version with known vulnerabilities, increasing the risk of server compromise beyond just data access. This was identified via an Nmap scan showing an open port 21 with 'ftp-anon' script output indicating anonymous login allowed.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>FTP Server (vsftpd 2.3.4 on port 21)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Enforcement - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers or accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access in the event of credential theft or compromise. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to critical systems and data, leading to data breaches, system disruption, or further lateral movement within the network. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Computer login systems</li><li>Sensitive data access systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Windows Operating System - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Workstations within the organization are running Windows 7. This operating system has reached its end-of-life and no longer receives security updates or patches from Microsoft. Consequently, these systems are vulnerable to a multitude of known exploits and malware, making them easy targets for attackers. Continued use of Windows 7 poses a significant risk of system compromise, data loss, and potential spread of malware across the network. This was identified through internal vulnerability assessment data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Workstations running Windows 7</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. This lack of recurring training leads to a degradation of security knowledge and vigilance over time, making employees more susceptible to social engineering attacks, phishing attempts, and other human-factor vulnerabilities. A well-trained workforce is a critical defense layer, and its absence increases the overall risk of successful cyberattacks. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to immediately disable anonymous FTP access and either decommission the FTP server if not essential, or upgrade to a current, supported version of vsftpd with secure configurations, including strong authentication and encryption. Implement and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and access to sensitive data systems to significantly enhance access control security. Prioritize the upgrade of all workstations running Windows 7 to a currently supported operating system like Windows 10 or 11 to ensure they receive critical security updates. Furthermore, establish and regularly conduct mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees to maintain a high level of security consciousness and reduce human-factor risks.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces a significant cybersecurity risk posture due to critical vulnerabilities including anonymous FTP access, the use of an outdated operating system on workstations, and a lack of MFA enforcement for critical access points. While some foundational policies are in place, the absence of comprehensive annual security awareness training further exacerbates these risks. Addressing these issues promptly through system upgrades, policy enforcement, and continuous employee education is crucial to improving the organization's overall security readiness and protecting against potential cyber threats.</p>
