        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network environment, based on the provided data, indicates a foundational lack in certain critical security controls, particularly concerning multi-factor authentication (MFA) and consistent security awareness training. While MFA is implemented for computer logins and an acceptable use policy is in place, significant gaps exist in protecting email and sensitive data systems, and in educating the workforce against prevalent cyber threats.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of email account compromise through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks. A compromised email account can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and further lateral movement within the network.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>All employee email accounts</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not enforced for access to sensitive data systems. This exposes critical organizational data to unauthorized access if primary credentials are compromised. A breach of these systems could result in severe data loss, regulatory fines, reputational damage, and significant financial impact.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts with access to sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. This leaves new hires vulnerable to social engineering tactics, phishing attempts, and unaware of organizational security policies and best practices from the outset. Untrained employees can inadvertently introduce malware, fall victim to scams, or expose sensitive information.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All new employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Annual Security Awareness Training for All Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not provide annual security awareness training for all employees. Without regular training, employees may not be updated on the latest cyber threats, evolving attack techniques, or changes in organizational security policies. This leads to a degradation of security posture over time, increasing the overall risk of human-factor related incidents.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's cybersecurity posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical systems, starting with email and sensitive data systems, to prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are stolen. Furthermore, a comprehensive security awareness training program should be established. This program must include mandatory training for all new hires upon onboarding and annual refresher training for all existing employees to ensure continuous education on current threats, organizational policies, and best practices. Regular training will empower employees to become a strong line of defense against social engineering and phishing attacks. Additionally, consider conducting regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing to identify and address technical weaknesses not covered by policy reviews.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces significant cybersecurity risks primarily due to critical gaps in multi-factor authentication implementation for email and sensitive data systems, and a complete absence of a structured security awareness training program for both new and existing employees. While some foundational policies like an acceptable use policy and MFA for computer logins are in place, these are insufficient to protect against modern threats. Addressing these identified vulnerabilities through strategic implementation of MFA and a robust, ongoing security awareness training program is crucial for improving the organization's readiness against cyberattacks and safeguarding its assets and data.</p>
