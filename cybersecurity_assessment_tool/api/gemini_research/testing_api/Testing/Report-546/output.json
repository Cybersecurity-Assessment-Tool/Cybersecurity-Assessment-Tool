            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization has implemented multi-factor authentication (MFA) for email access, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, demonstrating a strong commitment to access control. An employee acceptable use policy is also in place. However, a significant gap exists in security awareness training, as it is not conducted for new employees nor annually for all employees. Network scanning indicated a host is active, and while port 80 was reported as closed by the scanner, a vulnerability assessment identified an unencrypted web server on this port.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Unencrypted Web Server",
                        "Overview": "Port 80 is open, indicating an unencrypted web server. This allows for cleartext transmission of data, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. The risk was identified through a vulnerability assessment that detected an active service on this unencrypted port.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Port 80"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees during onboarding, nor does it provide annual refresher training for all employees. This leaves the workforce susceptible to social engineering attacks, phishing, malware, and other human-factor vulnerabilities, significantly increasing the risk of successful cyberattacks.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All Employees",
                            "New Employees"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to implement SSL/TLS encryption for all web services, particularly for any service operating on port 80, to protect data in transit. If the service on port 80 is not intended for public access, ensure it is properly secured, closed, or restricted to authorized internal networks. Furthermore, to address the significant gap in human-factor security, the organization must establish a comprehensive security awareness training program. This program should include mandatory training for all new employees during their onboarding process and annual refresher training for all existing employees to keep them informed about current cyber threats, phishing techniques, and best security practices.",
            "Conclusion": "In conclusion, the organization has established a commendable baseline for access control by implementing multi-factor authentication across email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, complemented by an acceptable use policy. Despite these strengths, the assessment reveals critical vulnerabilities, primarily the absence of a robust security awareness training program for both new and existing employees, which significantly increases the risk of human-error-induced breaches. Additionally, the presence of an unencrypted web server on port 80 presents a direct risk of data exposure. Addressing these identified gaps, particularly through comprehensive training and securing web communications, is paramount to elevating the organization's cybersecurity readiness and resilience against potential threats."
