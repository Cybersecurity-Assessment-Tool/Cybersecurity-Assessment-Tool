        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network assessment identified a potential unencrypted web server with Port 80 reported as open. From a policy perspective, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is mandated for email access but is not required for computer logins or sensitive data systems. The organization has an acceptable use policy in place and conducts annual security awareness training for all employees. However, new employees do not receive dedicated security awareness training upon onboarding.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unencrypted Web Server - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Port 80, typically used for unencrypted HTTP traffic, was identified as open. This exposes web communications to potential eavesdropping and data interception, impacting data confidentiality and integrity. The presence of an open unencrypted port can be exploited by attackers to intercept sensitive information or launch further attacks.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>It is strongly recommended to immediately close Port 80 if it is not intentionally used, or to configure it to redirect all traffic to HTTPS. For long-term security, implement SSL/TLS encryption for all web services to ensure data in transit is protected. Furthermore, the organization should extend MFA requirements to include computer logins and access to sensitive data systems to significantly enhance authentication security. A crucial step is to introduce comprehensive security awareness training for all new employees during their onboarding process to establish a strong security culture from the outset.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization exhibits a mixed security posture. While some foundational elements like an acceptable use policy and annual security training are present, critical gaps exist, particularly with the identified unencrypted web server (Port 80 being open) and the limited implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). The absence of security awareness training for new employees also presents an initial vulnerability. Addressing these areas, especially securing web traffic and expanding MFA, is crucial for improving the overall cybersecurity readiness and reducing the attack surface.</p>
