                "Summary": "The network scan indicated no open ports, suggesting a basic level of external network hardening. However, the organizational data reveals significant internal security posture weaknesses. While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is used for email access and an acceptable use policy is in place, there is a critical lack of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees or provide annual recurring training for all staff.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Computer Login",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for employees to log into their computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to internal systems and data if credentials are compromised through phishing, malware, or brute-force attacks. Without a second factor, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's workstation. This was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems",
                        "Overview": "Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required to access sensitive data systems. This is a critical vulnerability as it leaves high-value assets vulnerable to compromise. If an attacker gains access to credentials for these systems, they can directly access, exfiltrate, or tamper with sensitive organizational data without an additional layer of security. This was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",

                    {
                        "Risk": "No Security Awareness Training for New Employees",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not provide security awareness training for new employees. This means new hires may not be aware of common cybersecurity threats, organizational policies, or best practices for protecting sensitive information. This increases the likelihood of new employees falling victim to social engineering attacks, phishing, or inadvertently introducing vulnerabilities. This was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [

                    {
                        "Risk": "No Recurring Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. Without regular training, employees may forget best practices, become complacent, or remain unaware of evolving threat landscapes. This sustained lack of education makes the entire workforce more susceptible to sophisticated social engineering attacks and phishing campaigns over time. This was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "Organizational data",
                            "Network infrastructure"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "It is strongly recommended that the organization implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and, most critically, for access to all sensitive data systems. This will significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access even if credentials are stolen. Additionally, a comprehensive security awareness training program should be established. This program must include mandatory training for all new employees upon onboarding and recurring annual training for all staff to ensure continuous education on current threats and best practices. Regular simulated phishing exercises should also be considered to reinforce training.",
            "Conclusion": "While the external network appears to have a basic level of protection with no open ports identified, the organization's internal security posture is significantly compromised by a lack of fundamental controls. The absence of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, coupled with a complete lack of security awareness training for both new and existing employees, exposes the organization to a high risk of credential compromise, unauthorized data access, and successful social engineering attacks. Addressing these critical and high-severity vulnerabilities is paramount to improving the overall cybersecurity readiness."
