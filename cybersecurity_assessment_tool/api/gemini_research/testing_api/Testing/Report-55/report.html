        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan revealed an open SSH port (22) on a host, indicating a potential entry point that requires robust security controls. Policy review highlighted several critical gaps in the organization's security posture. While MFA is used for email, it is notably absent for computer logins and sensitive data systems, leaving these crucial access points vulnerable to credential compromise. Furthermore, the lack of an acceptable use policy and specific security awareness training for new employees creates significant human-factor risks, as employees may not be fully aware of their responsibilities or common threats. Annual security training is a positive step, but the initial onboarding gap is concerning.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Open SSH Port (22) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH port (22) was detected on a host. While SSH is a legitimate service for secure remote access, an exposed port without proper security controls (e.g., strong passwords, key-based authentication, rate limiting, IP whitelisting, MFA) can be a target for brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or other unauthorized access attempts. The impact could range from unauthorized access to systems to data exfiltration or system compromise. Identified via Nmap scan.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 22</li><li>Network host</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Logins - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised through phishing, malware, or other means. Without a second factor, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's workstation and potentially the internal network. Identified via organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Internal network access</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-Critical">Critical</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This poses a critical risk to data confidentiality and integrity. If an attacker gains access to credentials for these systems, they can access, modify, or exfiltrate sensitive data without an additional layer of security. This could lead to data breaches, regulatory fines, and reputational damage. Identified via organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>Confidential information</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks an employee acceptable use policy (AUP). An AUP defines the proper and acceptable use of organizational IT resources, including computers, networks, and data. Without a clear policy, employees may unknowingly engage in activities that introduce security risks (e.g., installing unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites, improper data handling), leading to potential malware infections, data loss, or compliance violations. Identified via organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational IT resources</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) as they may be less familiar with organizational security protocols and common threats. A lack of initial training leaves them vulnerable and can introduce significant human-factor risks to the organization from day one. While annual training is conducted, the absence of initial training is a critical gap. Identified via organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, the organization should immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and access to sensitive data systems to significantly reduce the impact of compromised credentials. The open SSH port (22) should be secured by implementing strong authentication methods (e.g., key-based authentication, disabling password authentication), IP whitelisting, rate limiting, and regular patching. Furthermore, a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy (AUP) must be developed and enforced to guide proper IT resource usage. Crucially, a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees should be established to ensure they are equipped with essential security knowledge from their first day, complementing the existing annual training. Regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing are also recommended to proactively identify and address further security weaknesses.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently faces several significant cybersecurity risks, primarily stemming from a lack of comprehensive Multi-Factor Authentication implementation and critical gaps in security policies and employee training. The open SSH port represents a technical vulnerability, while the absence of MFA for computer and sensitive data system logins, a formal acceptable use policy, and initial security awareness training for new hires expose the organization to substantial human-factor and access control risks. While annual security training is a positive, these identified weaknesses indicate a moderate to high level of vulnerability, requiring immediate and strategic remediation efforts to enhance the overall security posture and readiness against modern cyber threats.</p>
