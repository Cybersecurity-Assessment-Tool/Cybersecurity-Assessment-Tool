        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, and maintains an acceptable use policy along with security awareness training for new employees. However, a significant gap exists as MFA is not required for sensitive data systems, and annual security awareness training is not provided to all employees. While network scans indicated port 80 as closed, a reported vulnerability highlights a potential unencrypted web server issue related to this port.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Unencrypted Web Server - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Port 80 is open, indicating a potential unencrypted web server. This allows data to be transmitted in plain text, making it vulnerable to interception and eavesdropping. The impact could be the exposure of sensitive information if transmitted over this port. This was identified as a reported vulnerability.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 80</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if credentials are compromised, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication. This vulnerability was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User authentication processes</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. This leaves employees vulnerable to evolving social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, malware) and reduces their ability to identify and report security threats, increasing the overall human risk factor. This vulnerability was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is recommended to close port 80 if it is not essential, or implement SSL/TLS encryption for all web traffic if a web server is intended to be active on this port. Furthermore, implement mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all access to sensitive data systems to add an essential layer of security against credential theft. Finally, establish and enforce a policy for mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees, covering current threats like phishing, social engineering, and data handling best practices.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In conclusion, while the organization has established some foundational security controls such as MFA for general access and initial employee training, critical vulnerabilities remain. The absence of MFA for sensitive data systems and the lack of consistent annual security awareness training for all employees represent significant risks that could lead to unauthorized access or successful social engineering attacks. Furthermore, the reported unencrypted web server, if active, poses an additional exposure. Addressing these identified risks is paramount to strengthening the organization's cybersecurity posture and ensuring the protection of its sensitive information and systems.</p>
