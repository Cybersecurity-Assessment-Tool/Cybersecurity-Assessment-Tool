            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The network scan identified one active host with an open SSH (port 22) service. Organizationally, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for email access but is notably absent for computer logins and sensitive data systems. An employee acceptable use policy is in place, and annual security awareness training is conducted for all employees, though new employees do not receive specific security awareness training upon onboarding.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Localhost Exposed",
                        "Overview": "The scan identified an active host with an open SSH service (port 22). While SSH is a common remote access protocol, its exposure, especially without comprehensive MFA for computer logins, presents a critical risk. An attacker could potentially exploit weak credentials or unpatched vulnerabilities in the SSH daemon to gain unauthorized access to the system. This was identified via an Nmap scan showing port 22 as open.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Scanned IP Address",
                            "SSH Service (Port 22)"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended to review and harden the exposed SSH service. This includes ensuring strong, unique passwords or SSH keys are enforced, disabling root login, limiting access to specific IP addresses, and implementing a robust intrusion detection/prevention system. Furthermore, the organization should immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and access to sensitive data systems to significantly enhance authentication security. Initiating security awareness training for all new employees upon onboarding is also crucial to establish a foundational understanding of security best practices from day one. Regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing should be conducted to identify and address further potential exposures.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces a critical security risk due to an exposed SSH service, compounded by a lack of comprehensive Multi-Factor Authentication for computer logins and sensitive data systems. While some security policies and annual training are in place, gaps in new employee training and critical access controls leave the organization vulnerable to unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Addressing these vulnerabilities and implementing stronger authentication mechanisms are paramount to improving the overall security posture and readiness."
