            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security practices by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and having an acceptable use policy. New employees receive security awareness training. However, critical gaps exist in the application of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, and the organization lacks annual security awareness training for all employees, indicating a need for enhanced identity and access management controls and continuous employee education.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Computer Login",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for employees to log into their computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised through phishing, malware, or brute-force attacks. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to an employee's workstation and potentially the internal network. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.",
                        "Severity": "High",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Employee workstations",
                            "Internal network access points"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems",
                        "Overview": "Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not mandated for accessing sensitive data systems within the organization. This exposes critical data to a higher risk of breach. If an attacker gains access to a user's credentials, they could potentially access, exfiltrate, or tamper with sensitive information without an additional layer of authentication. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Sensitive data systems",
                            "Databases containing confidential information",
                            "Cloud storage for sensitive files"
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "Risk": "Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. While new employees receive initial training, the absence of recurring training means employees may not be updated on the latest threats, best practices, or changes in organizational policies. This increases the likelihood of employees falling victim to social engineering attacks, phishing, or making security errors due to outdated knowledge. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "All employees",
                            "Organizational security posture",
                            "Incident response readiness"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To mitigate the identified risks, it is strongly recommended that the organization implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all employee computer logins and sensitive data systems immediately. This will significantly enhance protection against credential theft and unauthorized access. Furthermore, a comprehensive annual security awareness training program should be established for all employees, covering current threat landscapes, phishing recognition, data handling best practices, and incident reporting procedures. Regular training ensures that security remains a top-of-mind priority and adapts to evolving threats.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization has a mixed security posture, with some foundational controls in place, such as MFA for email and initial security training for new hires. However, the absence of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, coupled with a lack of annual security awareness training for all employees, represents significant vulnerabilities. Addressing these critical gaps is essential to strengthen the organization's overall security readiness and protect against common cyber threats."
