        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network scan indicates that port 80 is closed, suggesting no immediately open unencrypted web server. However, a review of organizational data reveals significant gaps in security posture related to user authentication, policy enforcement, and employee training. Specifically, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for email access, and there is a complete absence of an employee acceptable use policy and regular security awareness training for both new and existing employees. While MFA is used for computer logins and sensitive data systems, the lack of it for email and the absence of foundational security policies and training represent critical vulnerabilities.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Email Access - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee inboxes if credentials are compromised through phishing, credential stuffing, or other attack vectors. Email accounts often contain sensitive information and can serve as a critical pivot point for attackers to gain further access to organizational systems and data.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Email system</li><li>Employee email accounts</li><li>Organizational data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently lacks a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy. Without clear guidelines defining the appropriate use of company IT resources, internet access, and email, employees may unknowingly engage in activities that introduce security risks, such as visiting malicious websites, downloading unauthorized software, or mishandling sensitive information. This absence can lead to increased exposure to malware, data leakage, and compliance issues.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Company IT resources</li><li>Network infrastructure</li><li>Data integrity</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees are not provided with security awareness training during their onboarding process. This leaves them vulnerable to common social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, vishing) and unaware of critical organizational security protocols and best practices from the outset. Untrained new hires can inadvertently become a weak link in the organization's security chain, increasing the likelihood of successful attacks.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network security</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>No Annual Security Awareness Training for All Employees - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees. Regular and ongoing training is essential to keep the workforce informed about evolving cyber threats, reinforce secure behaviors, and maintain a strong security culture. Without periodic refreshers, employees may forget previous guidance or remain unaware of new attack vectors, increasing the risk of human error leading to security incidents.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational data</li><li>Network security</li><li>Security culture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email access immediately. Furthermore, a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy should be developed, communicated, and enforced across the organization. Establishing mandatory security awareness training for all new employees as part of their onboarding process is crucial, alongside implementing annual mandatory security awareness training for all existing employees to ensure continuous education on evolving threats and best practices. These measures will address critical human and policy-based vulnerabilities.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While the external network scan indicates a relatively secure perimeter with no open unencrypted web server, the organization faces substantial internal security risks due to critical gaps in its human and policy-based controls. The absence of MFA for email, a formal acceptable use policy, and comprehensive security awareness training for both new and existing employees leaves the organization highly vulnerable to social engineering attacks, internal misuse, and potential data breaches. The current readiness level in these crucial areas is low, necessitating immediate action to mitigate these identified risks and build a more resilient security posture.</p>
