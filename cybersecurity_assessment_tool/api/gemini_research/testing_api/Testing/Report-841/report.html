        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a commitment to foundational security practices, including an acceptable use policy and regular security awareness training for all employees. However, significant vulnerabilities exist in access control, specifically the lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA) for email access and computer logins. The network scan identified an Nginx web server running version 1.18.0, which is an outdated version and likely susceptible to known vulnerabilities. While MFA is required for sensitive data systems, its absence in other critical access points presents a substantial risk.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for accessing employee email accounts. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if an employee's credentials are compromised through phishing, credential stuffing, or other means. A successful compromise could lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, or further internal network penetration.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee email accounts</li><li>Email infrastructure</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer Login - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require MFA for logging into computers. This leaves employee workstations and potentially the internal network vulnerable to unauthorized access if login credentials are stolen or guessed. Attackers could gain a foothold in the network, move laterally, install malware, or access sensitive data stored on local machines.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Employee workstations</li><li>Network access points</li><li>Internal systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Outdated Nginx Web Server Version - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Nginx web server running on port 443 is version 1.18.0. This version is outdated and likely End-of-Life (EOL), meaning it no longer receives security updates. It is highly probable that this version contains known security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access, perform denial-of-service attacks, or execute arbitrary code, compromising the integrity and availability of the hosted web services.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Web server (nginx 1.18.0)</li><li>Port 443</li><li>Associated web applications</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all email accounts and computer logins immediately. This critical step will drastically reduce the risk of unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised. Additionally, the Nginx web server should be updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities and ensure ongoing security support. Regular patching and vulnerability management processes should be established for all network-facing services. While security awareness training and an acceptable use policy are in place, these technical controls are essential to build a robust defense.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization has a foundational understanding of security best practices, evidenced by its policies and training programs. However, the absence of MFA for email and computer logins, coupled with an outdated Nginx web server, represents critical vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. Addressing these high-severity risks by implementing MFA across all access points and updating critical software is paramount to improving the organization's overall cybersecurity readiness and protecting against potential breaches.</p>
