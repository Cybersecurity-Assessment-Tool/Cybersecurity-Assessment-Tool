        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email, logging into computers, and accessing sensitive data systems, indicating a strong posture in identity and access management. However, there are notable gaps in foundational security policies and training, specifically the absence of an employee acceptable use policy and a lack of annual security awareness training for all employees. Network scans identified an open MySQL port (3306), indicating a potential database exposure to the network.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network, which could allow unauthorized access to the database if not properly secured. This exposure increases the risk of data breaches, unauthorized data manipulation, or denial-of-service attacks. The vulnerability was identified through network scanning, which revealed the open port.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>Immediately implement firewall rules to restrict access to MySQL port 3306, allowing connections only from trusted IP addresses or internal networks. For a long-term solution, consider placing the database behind a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or implementing more robust access controls and network segmentation. Develop and implement a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to clearly define expectations for technology usage and data handling. Establish and enforce a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees to ensure ongoing education on current threats and best security practices, addressing the current gap in regular training.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a commendable commitment to identity protection through widespread MFA implementation across critical access points. However, the presence of an exposed MySQL database represents a significant technical vulnerability. Furthermore, the absence of an employee acceptable use policy and a lack of annual security awareness training indicate critical gaps in foundational security practices and human-centric defenses. Addressing these identified vulnerabilities and policy deficiencies is paramount to enhancing the organization's overall security posture and readiness against potential cyber threats.</p>
