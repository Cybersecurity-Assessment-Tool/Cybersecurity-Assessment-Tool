        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization's network currently exposes a MySQL database on port 3306. Internally, the organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, and has an acceptable use policy along with security awareness training for new employees. However, MFA is not required for sensitive data systems, and annual security awareness training for all employees is not conducted, indicating areas for improvement in overall security posture.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Database Exposure - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the network. This allows external entities to potentially connect to and interact with the database, posing a significant risk of data breach, unauthorized access, or service disruption. The vulnerability was identified through network scanning which revealed the open port.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Port 3306 (MySQL)</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical data if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or other means. Without MFA, a single compromised password can lead to a severe data breach. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. This leaves employees vulnerable to evolving cyber threats such as phishing, social engineering, and malware, as their knowledge of current best practices may become outdated. A lack of regular training increases the likelihood of human error leading to security incidents. This was identified through organizational policy review.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To mitigate the identified risks, it is recommended to immediately implement strict firewall rules to restrict access to port 3306 (MySQL) to only authorized internal IP addresses or specific trusted services. For long-term security, consider placing the database behind a VPN or within a segmented network accessible only via secure channels. Furthermore, mandate Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all access to sensitive data systems to significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access even if primary credentials are compromised. Finally, establish and enforce a policy for mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees to ensure they are continuously updated on the latest cyber threats and best practices, thereby strengthening the human element of security.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security with MFA for email and computer logins, and initial security awareness training. However, critical vulnerabilities exist, including an exposed MySQL database and significant gaps in access control for sensitive data systems due to the lack of MFA. Furthermore, the absence of annual security awareness training for all employees poses a continuous risk of human-factor related incidents. Addressing these identified risks is crucial for enhancing the organization's overall cybersecurity posture and readiness against evolving threats.</p>
