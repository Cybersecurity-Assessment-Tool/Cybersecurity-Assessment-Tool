            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization's network currently exposes Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) on at least one host, indicating a direct internet-facing service that is a common target for attackers. Furthermore, the organization lacks critical foundational security controls, including Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. There is no established employee acceptable use policy, nor is there any security awareness training for new or existing employees. This combination of exposed services and a complete absence of basic security practices places the organization at a high risk of cyberattack and compromise.",
                "Vulnerabilites Found": [
                    {
                        "Risk": "RDP Exposure",
                        "Overview": "Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is exposed directly to the internet via an open port 3389, as identified during network scanning. This exposure allows potential attackers to attempt brute-force attacks or exploit known RDP vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to internal systems. Successful exploitation could lead to data theft, system compromise, and further lateral movement within the network, severely impacting business operations and data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.",
                        "Severity": "Critical",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "Affected Host(s) with RDP exposed on Port 3389"
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To significantly enhance the organization's security posture and mitigate identified risks, immediate action is required. Firstly, the exposed RDP service on Port 3389 must be immediately secured by either closing the port to the internet or restricting access to trusted IP addresses. For remote access, a Virtual Private Network (VPN) should be implemented, requiring users to connect via the VPN before accessing internal RDP services. Secondly, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be deployed across all critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, to prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised. Thirdly, a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy should be developed and enforced to establish clear guidelines for secure behavior. Finally, mandatory security awareness training for all new employees and annual refresher training for all staff should be implemented to educate employees on common cyber threats and best security practices.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces a critical security posture due to the direct exposure of RDP services and a significant absence of fundamental security controls. The lack of MFA, an acceptable use policy, and security awareness training creates numerous vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors, leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, and operational disruptions. Addressing these issues immediately is paramount to improving the organization's cybersecurity readiness and protecting its valuable assets from evolving cyber threats."
