            "Risk Assessment & Readiness": {
                "Summary": "The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and conducting annual security awareness training for all employees. However, a comprehensive review of the organizational security posture reveals several critical gaps in authentication protocols, policy enforcement, and employee training for new hires. Specifically, the absence of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, coupled with the lack of an acceptable use policy and initial security awareness training for new employees, significantly elevates the organization's risk profile. No technical vulnerabilities were identified through network scans.",

                        "Risk": "Inadequate Authentication for Computer Access",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for employees to log into computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised, as a single factor (password) is sufficient for authentication. This was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.",

This leaves critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access in the event of credential compromise, as a single factor (password) provides access to high-value assets. This was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Lack of Acceptable Use Policy",
                        "Overview": "The organization currently lacks an employee acceptable use policy. Without a formal policy, employees may be unaware of their responsibilities regarding the use of company IT resources, data handling, and internet usage, leading to potential misuse, data breaches, or compliance violations. This was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",

                    {
                        "Risk": "Inadequate Onboarding Security Training",
                        "Overview": "The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. This means new hires may not be immediately aware of critical security policies, best practices, and common threats (e.g., phishing), making them more susceptible to social engineering attacks and increasing the overall human risk factor from day one. While annual training is conducted, the initial onboarding gap is significant. This was identified through the organizational security questionnaire.",
                        "Severity": "Medium",
                        "Affected Elements": [
                            "New employees",

                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Recommendations": "To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is strongly recommended to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins and access to sensitive data systems. This will provide a crucial layer of defense against credential theft. Furthermore, the organization should develop and enforce a comprehensive employee acceptable use policy to clearly define expectations for IT resource usage and data handling. Finally, a mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees must be established to ensure immediate understanding of security best practices and policies upon joining the organization, complementing the existing annual training.",
            "Conclusion": "The organization currently faces significant risks due to gaps in its authentication protocols, policy framework, and initial employee security training. While some security measures are in place, the absence of MFA for critical access points and a formal acceptable use policy, combined with a lack of security onboarding for new hires, leaves the organization vulnerable to unauthorized access and human-factor related incidents. Addressing these vulnerabilities is crucial for improving overall readiness and protecting sensitive assets."
