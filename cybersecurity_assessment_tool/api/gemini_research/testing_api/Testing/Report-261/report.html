        <h1>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</h1>
    
        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins and maintains an employee acceptable use policy, indicating a foundational level of security. However, critical gaps were identified in the protection of sensitive data systems and in the organization's security awareness training program. Specifically, sensitive data systems do not require MFA, and there is a complete absence of security awareness training for both new employees and existing staff on an annual basis. A network scan identified an open port 8080 with a 'TOP SECRET DB' title, but this was subsequently assessed as a false positive and confirmed to be secure.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Identified Risks</h2>
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems - <span class="severity-High">High</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information if credentials are compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or other means. Without MFA, a single compromised password can grant an attacker full access to sensitive data, leading to potential data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and reputational damage. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'Do you require MFA to access sensitive data systems?':'No'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>Sensitive data systems</li><li>User accounts accessing sensitive data</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Insufficient New Employee Security Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for new employees. This leaves new hires vulnerable to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) and unaware of critical security policies and best practices from the start. Untrained employees are more likely to fall victim to attacks, potentially introducing malware, compromising credentials, or inadvertently exposing sensitive information. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'Does your organization do security awareness training for new employees?':'No'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>New employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li><li>Information systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="risk-card">
                <h3>Lack of Regular Security Awareness Training - <span class="severity-Medium">Medium</span></h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not conduct security awareness training for all employees at least once per year. This results in a stale understanding of evolving cyber threats, new attack vectors, and updated security policies. Regular training is crucial to reinforce best practices, educate employees on current threats, and maintain a strong human firewall against social engineering and other attacks. Without ongoing education, employees may become complacent or unaware of new risks, increasing the likelihood of successful cyberattacks. This vulnerability was identified through the organizational data indicating 'Does your organization do security awareness training for all employees at least once per year?':'No'.</p>
                <p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong></p>
                <ul><li>All employees</li><li>Organizational security posture</li><li>Information systems</li></ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2><ul><li>To significantly enhance the organization's security posture, it is imperative to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data systems immediately. This will provide a critical layer of defense against unauthorized access, even if user credentials are compromised. Concurrently, a comprehensive and continuous security awareness program must be established. This program should include mandatory security awareness training for all new employees as part of their onboarding process, covering current threats, phishing recognition, and organizational security policies. Furthermore, annual security awareness training should be conducted for all employees to ensure ongoing education on evolving cyber threats, reinforce best practices, and maintain a strong human defense layer against social engineering attacks. Regular training will empower employees to identify and report suspicious activities, thereby significantly reducing the overall risk of successful cyber incidents.</li></ul>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The organization currently presents a mixed cybersecurity readiness profile. While positive steps have been taken with MFA for email and computer logins, critical vulnerabilities persist in the protection of sensitive data systems and in the area of employee security awareness. The absence of MFA for sensitive data and the lack of both new hire and annual security training represent significant risks that could lead to data breaches, operational disruptions, or successful social engineering attacks. Addressing these identified vulnerabilities through the recommended implementation of MFA for sensitive data systems and the establishment of a robust, ongoing security awareness program is crucial for elevating the overall security posture and effectively mitigating potential threats.</p>
