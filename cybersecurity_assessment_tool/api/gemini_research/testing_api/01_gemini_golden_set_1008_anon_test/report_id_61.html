<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity assessment for
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, conducted on November 22, 2025.
The analysis is based on a combination of network scanning, a review of
organizational security controls, and an evaluation of pre-existing
risks.</p>
<p>The assessment identified several high-impact risks that require
immediate attention. A critical control gap was discovered: the absence
of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access, which exposes the
organization to a significant risk of business email compromise and
account takeover attacks.</p>
<p>Furthermore, technical scanning revealed an externally facing web
server running an outdated version of Nginx (1.18.0). This software
version is known to have multiple security vulnerabilities, presenting a
direct threat to the confidentiality and availability of the services it
hosts.</p>
<p>Policy and procedural gaps were also noted, including the lack of a
formal Acceptable Use Policy and the absence of mandatory annual
security awareness training for all employees. These deficiencies weaken
the organization’s overall security culture and increase the likelihood
of human error leading to a security incident.</p>
<p>In summary, while some security controls are in place, the
combination of a critical authentication gap, a vulnerable external
service, and key policy weaknesses places the organization at a high
risk of a security breach. The recommendations outlined in this report
should be prioritized to mitigate these risks effectively.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-findings">Analysis of Findings</h2>
<p>The scan identified an Nginx web server, version
<strong>1.18.0</strong>, accessible on port 443 (HTTPS). This version
was released in April 2020 and is now considered outdated. The current
stable version of Nginx has received numerous security patches and
updates that are not present in version 1.18.0. Running outdated
software on internet-facing systems is a high-risk practice, as it may
be vulnerable to publicly known exploits.</p>

and the technical scan to provide a consolidated list of identified
risks. No pre-existing vulnerabilities were reported.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified
risks. Recommendations are prioritized based on severity.</p>
<h4 id="risk-001-implement-mfa-for-email-priority-immediate">RISK-001:
Implement MFA for Email (Priority: Immediate)</h4>
<p>Immediately enforce MFA for all user access to the email system. This
is the single most effective control to prevent unauthorized account
access. Prioritize deployment for privileged accounts and
executives.</p>
<h4 id="risk-002-upgrade-nginx-web-server-priority-high">RISK-002:
Upgrade Nginx Web Server (Priority: High)</h4>
<p>Plan and execute an upgrade of the Nginx server from version 1.18.0
to the latest stable release. Before deployment, test the new version in
a staging environment to ensure compatibility with existing
applications. Regularly schedule patch management for all
internet-facing systems.</p>
<h4
id="risk-003-establish-annual-security-training-priority-high">RISK-003:
Establish Annual Security Training (Priority: High)</h4>
<p>Develop and implement a mandatory annual security awareness training
program for all employees. The training should cover current threats
such as phishing, ransomware, and proper data handling. Track completion
to ensure full compliance.</p>
<h4 id="risk-004-develop-and-implement-an-aup-priority-high">RISK-004:
Develop and Implement an AUP (Priority: High)</h4>
<p>Draft a comprehensive Acceptable Use Policy that clearly defines the
rules and responsibilities for all users of the organization’s IT
systems. This policy should be formally communicated to all employees
and acknowledged via signature.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The assessment for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong> has revealed
a mix of procedural and technical vulnerabilities that create a
significant risk profile. While foundational controls like MFA for
computer logins are in place, critical gaps in email security, patch
management, and employee security governance must be addressed
urgently.</p>
<p>By implementing the recommendations provided in this report, the
organization can substantially improve its security posture, reduce its
attack surface, and build a more resilient defense against modern cyber
threats.</p>
