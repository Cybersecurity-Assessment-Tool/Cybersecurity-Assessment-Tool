<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This assessment reveals a mixed security posture for
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The organization has successfully
implemented several important foundational controls, including mandatory
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access, an employee
acceptable use policy, and annual security awareness training. These
measures significantly reduce the risk of account compromise and
establish a baseline for secure employee conduct.</p>
<p>However, several critical and high-risk gaps were identified that
require immediate attention. The most significant concerns are the
absence of MFA for computer logins and access to sensitive data systems.
This exposes the organization to substantial risk from credential theft,
potentially leading to unauthorized access and data breaches.
Furthermore, the lack of security awareness training for new employees
during their onboarding process leaves a window of vulnerability where
new staff may be more susceptible to social engineering attacks.</p>
<p>A technical network scan of the external IP address revealed a
minimal attack surface, with port 80 (HTTP) found to be closed. This
finding contradicts a pre-existing documented risk concerning an
"Unencrypted Web Server." This discrepancy suggests the risk may have
been remediated.</p>
<p>Our primary recommendations are to prioritize the deployment of MFA
across all workstations and sensitive systems, integrate mandatory
security training into the employee onboarding process, and formally
verify and update the status of the "Unencrypted Web Server" risk in the
organization’s risk register.</p>

<h4 id="analysis">Analysis:</h4>
<p>The questionnaire reveals critical gaps in access control. The lack
of MFA on computer and sensitive system logins significantly increases
the risk of unauthorized access via compromised credentials. The absence
of security training during onboarding is a high-risk gap, as new
employees are often prime targets for phishing and other social
engineering attacks.</p>

<h4 id="analysis-1">Analysis:</h4>
<p>The scan found no open ports on the target system. Specifically, port
80 (HTTP) was confirmed to be closed. This is a positive security
finding, as it reduces the external attack surface. However, this result
directly contradicts the pre-existing risk documented in Input 3, which
states that port 80 is open. This discrepancy requires further
investigation to determine if the risk has been resolved or if the
initial report was inaccurate.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis, we provide the following prioritized
recommendations to mitigate the identified risks.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Comprehensive MFA (RISK-01,
RISK-02):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Priority:</strong> Deploy a robust MFA solution
for all access to systems identified as containing sensitive data. This
is the most critical step to prevent a major data breach.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>High Priority:</strong> Enforce MFA for all employee
logins to company workstations and laptops. This strengthens the initial
line of defense against network intrusion.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Onboarding Security Training
(RISK-03):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop and integrate a mandatory
security awareness training module into the new employee onboarding
process. This training should cover, at a minimum: acceptable use,
phishing identification, password hygiene, and incident reporting
procedures.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Verify and Update Risk Register (RISK-04):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Conduct an internal review to confirm
the status of the web server on Port 80. If the service has been
decommissioned, formally close the risk in the risk register. If the
service was moved or the initial finding was a false positive, update
the documentation to reflect the accurate state.</p></li>
