<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">1. Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity assessment for
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, conducted on 2026-01-30. The
analysis synthesizes data from an external network penetration test, a
review of internal security controls via a questionnaire, and a list of
pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The external network scan revealed a strong perimeter security
posture, with no open ports detected on the target system . This
indicates effective firewall configuration and a minimized external
attack surface, which is a significant strength.</p>
<p>However, the internal security control review identified several
critical gaps in organizational policy and user access controls. The
most pressing issues include the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) for computer logins, the lack of a formal Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP), and no mandatory security awareness training for new employees.
These deficiencies expose the organization to significant risks,
including unauthorized access via compromised credentials, insider
threats, and social engineering attacks.</p>
<p>This report details these findings and provides actionable
recommendations to mitigate the identified risks and strengthen the
overall security posture of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-control-gaps">Analysis of Control
Gaps</h2>
<p>While the organization has implemented important controls such as MFA
for email and sensitive systems, three critical gaps were
identified:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>No MFA for Computer Logins:</strong> This is a high-risk
vulnerability. If an employee’s password is stolen (e.g., via phishing),
an attacker could gain direct access to their computer and the internal
network.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> The absence of
an AUP means there are no formally documented rules for employees
regarding the use of company assets, data handling, and security
responsibilities. This increases the risk of both accidental and
malicious insider threats.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Security Training for New Hires:</strong> New
employees are often prime targets for social engineering. Without
immediate training upon being hired, they represent a significant weak
point in the organization’s human firewall.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">4. Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed using Nmap against the
designated target IP address.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Status:</strong> Completed</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="findings">Findings</h2>
<p>The scan concluded that the host was online, but reported that all
scanned ports were in a <strong>closed</strong> state. No open or
filtered ports were discovered.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> This is a positive security finding. It
indicates that the external firewall is properly configured to deny
unsolicited inbound traffic, effectively minimizing the network’s attack
surface from the public internet. No vulnerabilities related to exposed
services were identified.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="overall-risk-assessment">5. Overall Risk
Assessment</h1>
<p>This section correlates findings from the security control review and
the technical scan. While no pre-existing risks were provided and no
technical vulnerabilities were found on the perimeter, the policy and
procedural gaps identified in the questionnaire present a high level of
risk to the organization.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">6. Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis, we provide the following actionable
recommendations to mitigate the identified risks and improve the overall
security posture of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for All Computer Logins:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Deploy a robust MFA solution (e.g.,
authenticator app, hardware token, or biometrics) for all user
endpoints, including laptops and desktops.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> Critical. Begin with privileged
accounts (administrators) and then roll out to all users.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Drastically reduces the risk of
unauthorized access from compromised credentials.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Create a comprehensive AUP that clearly
defines the rules for using company technology, accessing data, and
employee security responsibilities. This policy should be reviewed by
legal counsel.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> High. All current employees must read
and formally acknowledge the policy. It should be a mandatory part of
the new hire onboarding process.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Establishes a clear security baseline
for all employees and provides a framework for enforcement.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Integrate Security Training into New Hire
Onboarding:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop a mandatory security awareness
training module for all new employees to be completed within their first
week of employment. This should cover topics like phishing, password
security, and the new AUP.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> High. This closes a critical window of
vulnerability when new hires are most susceptible.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Reduces the likelihood of new employees
falling victim to social engineering attacks and strengthens the
organization’s human firewall from day one.</p></li>
</ul></li>
