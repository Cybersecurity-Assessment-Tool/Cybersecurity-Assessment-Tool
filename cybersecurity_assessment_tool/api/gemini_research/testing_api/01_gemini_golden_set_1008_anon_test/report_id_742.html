<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity assessment for
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on an analysis of
organizational security controls, an external network scan, and a review
of existing risks.</p>
<p>The assessment reveals a mixed security posture. On one hand, the
external network scan of the target host <code>[Target IP]</code> showed
a strong defensive configuration, with no open ports detected. This
indicates a well-hardened perimeter for the scanned asset. The
organization also demonstrates a commitment to security awareness
training and has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email
access, which is a commendable control.</p>
<p>However, significant and critical gaps were identified in core access
control and governance policies. The absence of MFA on employee
computers and, most critically, on sensitive data systems, exposes the
organization to a high risk of unauthorized access and data breach
through credential compromise. Furthermore, the lack of a formal
Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) represents a foundational governance
weakness, leaving the organization without clear guidelines for employee
technology use and lacking a key administrative control.</p>
<p>Immediate remediation should focus on implementing MFA across all
critical systems and developing a formal AUP to establish a stronger
security baseline.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-control-gaps">Analysis of Control Gaps</h2>
<p>The review identified three significant control gaps:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>No MFA for Computer Logins:</strong> The lack of MFA on
workstations means that a single compromised password could grant an
attacker full access to an employee’s machine and a foothold on the
internal network.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No MFA for Sensitive Systems:</strong> This is a critical
vulnerability. Sensitive data repositories are primary targets for
attackers. Without MFA, they are protected only by a password, making
them highly susceptible to credential stuffing, phishing, and
brute-force attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> An AUP is a
fundamental governance document that sets expectations for employee use
of company assets. Its absence can lead to inconsistent security
practices, misuse of resources, and weakened legal standing in the event
of an insider incident.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed to identify open ports and
exposed services on the public-facing infrastructure.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Data not provided in scan
results.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="findings">Findings</h2>
<p>The scan completed successfully against the target host. <strong>No
open TCP or UDP ports were discovered.</strong></p>
<p>This result indicates a strong network security posture for this
specific host. A "default-deny" firewall configuration, which blocks all
incoming traffic unless explicitly allowed, is a security best practice.
This significantly reduces the external attack surface and limits the
ability of unauthorized actors to probe for vulnerabilities.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes findings from the security control review
and technical scan. No pre-existing vulnerabilities were provided for
this assessment. The following risks have been identified based on the
control gaps discovered.</p>

insider policy violations.</td>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the risks identified in Section 5, the following actions are
recommended to improve the organization’s cybersecurity posture.
Recommendations are prioritized by severity.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA on Sensitive Data Systems
(Critical):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediately deploy a robust MFA solution
for all systems classified as containing sensitive or critical data.
This includes databases, financial applications, and administrative
portals.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> This is the most effective single
control to prevent unauthorized access to the organization’s most
valuable data assets. It mitigates the risk of a data breach resulting
from stolen credentials.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Enforce MFA for all Workstation and VPN Logins
(High):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Roll out MFA for all employee computer
logins (Windows, macOS) and for all remote access solutions
(VPN).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> This action protects the initial
entry points to the corporate network, preventing attackers from gaining
a foothold even if they acquire a user’s password.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(High):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Draft, approve, and disseminate a formal
AUP that clearly defines the rules and expectations for the use of
company technology, data, and network resources. Require all employees
to read and acknowledge the policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> An AUP is a foundational
administrative control that establishes a baseline for secure user
behavior, supports security awareness training, and provides a legal
framework for enforcing security policies.</p></li>
</ul></li>
