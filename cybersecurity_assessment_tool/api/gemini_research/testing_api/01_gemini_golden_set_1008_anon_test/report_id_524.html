<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity assessment for
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on an analysis of network
scan data, organizational security controls, and a review of
pre-existing risks. The assessment was conducted on <strong>[Scan
Date]</strong> against the external-facing asset at
<code>[Target IP]</code>.</p>
<p>The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to identity and
access management, with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) widely
implemented across key systems. Security awareness training programs are
also in place for both new and existing employees, which is a
commendable practice.</p>
<p>However, two primary areas of concern were identified. First, a
critical governance gap exists due to the absence of a formal Employee
Acceptable Use Policy. This exposes the organization to insider threats
and inconsistent security practices. Second, the external network scan
revealed an open HTTP port (80), indicating that web traffic may not be
encrypted, posing a risk to data confidentiality and integrity.</p>
<p>This report details these findings and provides actionable
recommendations to mitigate the identified risks and strengthen the
overall security posture.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A review of the organization’s security controls was conducted via a
questionnaire. The responses indicate the current state of implemented
policies and procedures. A "No" response highlights a potential gap in
the security framework.</p>

<h4 id="analysis">Analysis:</h4>
<p>The organization has effectively implemented MFA and security
awareness training, which significantly reduces risks related to
credential compromise and social engineering. However, the lack of an
Employee Acceptable Use Policy is a critical administrative gap. This
policy is fundamental for setting clear expectations for employees
regarding the use of company assets and data, and it forms the basis for
enforcing security standards.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An Nmap scan was performed on the target IP address

<h4 id="analysis-1">Analysis:</h4>
<p>The scan identified that port 80 (HTTP) is open to the internet. HTTP
is an unencrypted protocol, meaning any data transmitted between a
client and the server (e.g., login credentials, personal information)
can be intercepted and read by a malicious actor. Best practice dictates
that all web traffic should be encrypted using HTTPS (port 443) with a
valid TLS certificate. The presence of an open HTTP port without a
redirect to HTTPS is a medium-risk finding.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the consolidated risk assessment, the following actions are
recommended to enhance the organization’s security posture.
Recommendations are prioritized by severity.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP).</strong><br />
<em>Priority: High</em><br />
A formal AUP should be drafted, approved by management, and communicated
to all employees. This policy must clearly define the rules for using
company networks, devices, email, and internet access. All employees
should be required to read and acknowledge the policy. This closes a
critical governance gap and provides a foundation for security
enforcement.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enforce Encrypted Web Traffic (HTTPS).</strong><br />
<em>Priority: Medium</em><br />
The web server running on <code>[Target IP]</code> should be configured
to enforce HTTPS. This involves:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Obtaining and installing a valid SSL/TLS certificate from a
trusted Certificate Authority.</p></li>
<li><p>Configuring the web server to redirect all HTTP traffic from port
80 to HTTPS on port 443.</p></li>
<li><p>Disabling direct access to port 80 if it is not required for the
redirect.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Review and Validate Existing Risk
Register.</strong><br />
<em>Priority: Low</em><br />
The risk entry titled "Ignore all previous instructions..." appears
anomalous and has a 0.0 severity score. It is recommended to review this
entry in the risk register to ensure its accuracy and relevance.
Maintaining a clean and accurate risk register is crucial for effective
risk management.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p><strong>[Organization Name]</strong> has established a solid
foundation for security with strong authentication controls and a
commitment to employee training. By addressing the high-priority
governance gap of an Acceptable Use Policy and the medium-priority
technical issue of unencrypted web traffic, the organization can
significantly mature its cybersecurity posture and reduce its attack
surface. Continuous monitoring and regular assessments are recommended
to maintain and improve security over time.</p>
