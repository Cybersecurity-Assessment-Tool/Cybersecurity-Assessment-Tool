<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity assessment for
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on an analysis of network
scan data, organizational security controls, and existing risk
registers. The assessment was conducted on 2026-01-30.</p>
<p>The analysis reveals several critical and high-risk security gaps
that require immediate attention. Key findings include the absence of
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and sensitive data
systems, a lack of a formal security awareness training program, and the
direct exposure of a Secure Shell (SSH) management port to the public
internet.</p>
<p>These deficiencies create significant vulnerabilities to credential
theft, unauthorized access, and lateral movement within the network.
While the organization has correctly implemented MFA for email access,
this single control is insufficient to protect against modern threats.
We have provided a series of prioritized, actionable recommendations to
mitigate these risks and strengthen the overall security posture.</p>

<p>This section details the organizational context for this assessment.

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A review of the organization’s self-reported security controls was
conducted via a questionnaire. The responses indicate significant gaps
in foundational security policies and procedures. A "No" response ()
highlights a missing control and a potential area of high risk.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-controls">Analysis of
Controls</h2>
<p>The lack of MFA on computer logins and sensitive data systems
represents a <strong>critical risk</strong>. Should an attacker
compromise a user’s password, there are no secondary authentication
barriers to prevent unauthorized access to endpoints and critical
information. Furthermore, the absence of a security awareness training
program and an acceptable use policy indicates a weak security culture,
making the organization more susceptible to social engineering attacks
like phishing.</p>

Technical Findings</h2>
<p>Exposing SSH (Port 22) directly to the internet is a high-risk
configuration. This service is a primary target for attackers who use
automated tools to guess credentials. When combined with the lack of MFA
on computer logins, a successful brute-force attack on this service
could grant an adversary direct access to the internal network.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the risk assessment, the following prioritized actions are
recommended to mitigate the identified vulnerabilities and improve the
overall security posture of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>[Critical] Implement MFA for Sensitive Systems:</strong>
Immediately deploy a robust MFA solution for all systems identified as
containing sensitive or critical data. This is the highest priority
action to prevent data breaches.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>[High] Secure the Exposed SSH Service:</strong> Restrict
access to the SSH port on <code>[Target IP]</code>. The best practice is
to place it behind a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or a bastion host. At
a minimum, implement a firewall rule to allow access only from trusted
IP addresses and enforce strong, key-based authentication.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>[High] Deploy MFA for Endpoint Logins:</strong> Enforce
MFA for all user logins to company computers and servers. This measure
is crucial for preventing lateral movement within the network after an
initial compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>[High] Establish a Security Awareness Program:</strong>
Develop and implement a mandatory security awareness training program.
This must include training for all new hires during onboarding and an
annual refresher course for all staff covering topics like phishing,
password hygiene, and data handling.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>[Medium] Develop an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong>
Draft, approve, and disseminate a formal AUP that clearly defines the
rules and responsibilities for all employees when using company
technology and data.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The assessment for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong> has
identified significant and actionable security risks. While the
organization has made a positive step by securing email with MFA,
critical gaps remain in protecting endpoints, sensitive data, and
educating employees. The direct exposure of management services like SSH
further elevates the risk profile.</p>
<p>By implementing the prioritized recommendations in this report, the
organization can substantially reduce its attack surface, improve its
resilience against common cyber threats, and build a stronger foundation
for its long-term security strategy.</p>
