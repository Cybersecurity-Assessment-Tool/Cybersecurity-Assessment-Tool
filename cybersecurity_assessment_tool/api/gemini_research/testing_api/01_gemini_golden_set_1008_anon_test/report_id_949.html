<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment conducted for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong> on
November 22, 2025. The assessment combined a review of organizational
security controls, an external network scan, and an analysis of
pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The analysis revealed several critical and high-risk gaps in the
organization’s security posture. Most notably, there is a lack of
multi-factor authentication (MFA) for sensitive data systems, a complete
absence of an employee security awareness training program, and no
formal acceptable use policy. These policy and procedural deficiencies
create a significant risk of security incidents originating from human
error or insider threats.</p>
<p>From a technical perspective, the external scan identified a web
server running an outdated version of Nginx (<code>1.18.0</code>).
Outdated software is a common vector for attacks, as it often contains
publicly known vulnerabilities. When combined with the identified policy
gaps, this technical finding elevates the organization’s overall risk
profile.</p>
<p>Urgent remediation is recommended, focusing on the implementation of
MFA, the development of a security awareness program, and the patching
of vulnerable software to mitigate these risks effectively.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following details were used as the basis for this assessment. Due
to the anonymized nature of the provided data, placeholders have been
used where necessary.</p>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A security questionnaire was completed to evaluate the organization’s
current policies and controls. The responses indicate significant gaps
in foundational security practices. A "No" response () highlights a
control that is not in place and represents a potential risk.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of Technical
Findings</h2>
<p>The scan identified an Nginx web server, version
<strong>1.18.0</strong>. This version was released in April 2020 and is
now considered outdated. Current stable versions are significantly
newer. Running outdated software introduces unnecessary risk, as
numerous vulnerabilities have been discovered and patched in subsequent
releases. This server should be considered vulnerable to known
exploits.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and improve the overall security
posture of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, the following actions
are recommended with high priority.</p>
<dl>
<dt>For RISK-001:</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>Implement Mandatory MFA.</strong> Immediately deploy and
enforce a robust MFA solution across all sensitive data systems,
including databases, financial applications, and administrative
portals.</p>
</dd>
<dt>For RISK-002:</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>Establish a Security Awareness Program.</strong> Develop and
implement a mandatory security awareness training program for all
employees. The program should be conducted upon hiring and repeated
annually. It should cover topics such as phishing identification,
password hygiene, and incident reporting.</p>
</dd>
<dt>For RISK-003:</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>Develop and Enforce an AUP.</strong> Draft a comprehensive
Acceptable Use Policy that clearly defines the rules for using company
networks, devices, and data. This policy should be communicated to all
employees and formally acknowledged.</p>
</dd>
<dt>For RISK-004:</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>Patch Outdated Software.</strong> Plan and execute an upgrade
of the Nginx web server on host <code>[Target IP]</code> to the latest
stable version. Implement a continuous vulnerability management program
to ensure all public-facing software is kept up-to-date.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The assessment for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong> has
identified significant, yet remediable, weaknesses in both policy and
technical security controls. The combination of a vulnerable external
service and a lack of internal security culture presents a high degree
of risk. By implementing the recommendations outlined in this report,
the organization can substantially reduce its attack surface and build a
more resilient security posture.</p>
