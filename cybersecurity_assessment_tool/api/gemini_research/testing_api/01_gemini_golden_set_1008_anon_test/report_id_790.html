<h1 id="executive-overview">Executive Overview</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity assessment
conducted for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The evaluation
combined an analysis of organizational security controls via a
questionnaire, a technical network scan of the external perimeter, and a
review of pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The assessment reveals a significant disparity between the
organization’s technical perimeter security and its internal security
practices. The external network scan of the target IP address,
<code>[Target IP]</code>, identified no open ports or exposed services.
This suggests a strong firewall configuration that effectively limits
the external attack surface, which is a commendable security
posture.</p>
<p>However, critical gaps were identified in the organization’s internal
security controls. The failure to enforce Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) for email and access to sensitive data systems represents a
<strong>Critical Risk</strong>. Furthermore, the lack of a structured
security awareness training program for new and existing employees
constitutes a <strong>High Risk</strong>. These weaknesses expose the
organization to significant threats, including business email
compromise, data breaches, and social engineering attacks, despite the
strong network perimeter.</p>
<p>Immediate action is required to address these policy and procedural
gaps to build a defense-in-depth security strategy and mitigate the risk
of a serious security incident.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following details were used as the basis for this assessment.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Organization Name:</strong> <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Assumed Email Domain:</strong>
<code>[Domain]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>External IP Assessed:</strong>
<code>[Client IP]</code></p></li>

<h1 id="security-control-review-questionnaire-analysis">Security Control
Review (Questionnaire Analysis)</h1>
<p>An assessment of internal security controls was conducted based on a
standardized questionnaire. The responses indicate foundational
strengths in some areas but critical weaknesses in others. A summary of
the responses is provided in Table <a href="#tab:controls"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="tab:controls">1</a>.</p>
<p>The absence of MFA for email and sensitive data, coupled with a lack
of security awareness training, are the most pressing concerns
identified from this review.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network reconnaissance scan was performed to identify externally
exposed services and potential vulnerabilities on the organization’s
public-facing infrastructure.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> <strong>[Scan Date]</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="summary-of-findings">Summary of Findings</h2>
<p>The network scan of the target IP address did not identify any open
TCP or UDP ports. This indicates a strong firewall configuration that
blocks unsolicited inbound traffic or that the host was unresponsive at
the time of the scan.</p>
<p><strong>No externally exposed services, products, or software
versions were discovered.</strong> This is a positive finding, as it
significantly reduces the attack surface available to external threat
actors.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes findings from the security control review
and the technical scan. While the technical posture is strong, the
organizational control gaps introduce significant risk. The identified
risks are detailed in Table <a href="#tab:risks"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="tab:risks">2</a>. No
pre-existing vulnerabilities were provided for this assessment.</p>

<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Lack of MFA on Email</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Failure to protect email accounts with MFA

compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and further internal network
compromise.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Lack of MFA on Sensitive
Systems</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Sensitive data systems that lack MFA are
at an elevated risk of unauthorized access. If an attacker obtains valid
credentials, they can access and exfiltrate sensitive company or
customer data without facing a second authentication challenge.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Inadequate Security Awareness
Training</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The absence of initial and recurring
training leaves employees unable to recognize and respond to social
engineering and phishing attacks. This effectively makes employees an
unintentional insider threat and the weakest link in the security
chain.</td>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the risks identified in this report, the following actions
are recommended to improve the overall security posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. Recommendations are prioritized
based on severity and impact.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication
(Critical):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Immediately deploy and enforce MFA across all user accounts for
email access (e.g., Office 365, Google Workspace).</p></li>
<li><p>Audit all systems that store or process sensitive data and
enforce MFA for access.</p></li>
<li><p>This is the single most effective control to mitigate the risk of
unauthorized access from compromised credentials.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish a Security Awareness Training Program
(High):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and implement a formal security awareness training
program that is mandatory for all new employees during their onboarding
process.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct mandatory, annual refresher training for all staff to
ensure their knowledge remains current.</p></li>
<li><p>Training topics should include, at a minimum: phishing and
spear-phishing identification, password security, and the company’s
acceptable use policy.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Maintain and Validate Network Security
(Informational):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Continue to maintain the current strong firewall posture that
limits external exposure.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct periodic, authenticated external vulnerability scans to
validate that no new services are inadvertently exposed and that the
firewall configuration remains effective.</p></li>
</ul></li>
