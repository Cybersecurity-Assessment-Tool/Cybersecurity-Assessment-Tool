<p><strong>Cybersecurity Posture Assessment Report</strong></p>
<p>Prepared for: <strong>[Organization Name]</strong></p>

<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The assessment
combined a review of organizational security controls, an external
network vulnerability scan, and an analysis of pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The overall security posture presents a notable contrast. On one
hand, the organization’s external network perimeter appears highly
secure. A network scan against the designated target IP address revealed
no open ports, indicating a robust and well-configured firewall that
effectively minimizes the external attack surface. This is a commendable
security practice.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a critical administrative gap was identified in
the security control review. The organization currently lacks a formal
Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). This absence represents a
<strong>High</strong> risk, as it fails to establish clear guidelines
for employees regarding the use of company assets, potentially leading
to unintentional security incidents, insider threats, and legal
liabilities.</p>
<p>Key recommendations focus on mitigating this policy gap by
immediately developing and implementing a comprehensive AUP. Continued
vigilance in maintaining the strong network perimeter is also
advised.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-controls">Analysis of
Controls</h2>
<p>The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to identity and
access management, with comprehensive enforcement of Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) across critical systems. The security awareness
training program appears robust, covering both onboarding and annual
refreshers.</p>
<p>However, the lack of an Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) is a
critical deficiency. An AUP is a foundational governance document that
sets clear expectations for all employees on the proper use of corporate
technology and data resources. Its absence creates ambiguity and
increases the risk of both malicious and accidental insider threats.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed to identify open ports,
running services, and potential vulnerabilities visible from the public
internet.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Data not provided in scan
results.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Used:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="summary-of-findings">Summary of Findings</h2>
<p>The scan determined that the target host is online and responsive.
However, <strong>no open TCP or UDP ports were discovered</strong>. All
scanned ports were found to be in a ‘closed‘ state.</p>
<h4 id="interpretation">Interpretation:</h4>
<p>This result is highly positive from a security perspective. It
indicates that a strong, default-deny firewall policy is in place, which
significantly reduces the external attack surface. This configuration
prevents unauthorized external actors from discovering and potentially
exploiting network services.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes findings from the security control review,
technical scan, and pre-existing risk data to provide a consolidated

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended to
improve the security posture of <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong>.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="high-priority-recommendations">High Priority
Recommendations</h2>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="develop-and-implement-an-acceptable-use-policy-aup">1. Develop and
Implement an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Draft a comprehensive AUP that clearly
defines rules and responsibilities for all employees and contractors.
The policy should cover topics such as data handling, internet usage,
email security, use of personal devices (BYOD), and consequences for
non-compliance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> An AUP is a critical administrative
control that reduces insider threats, provides a legal framework for
enforcing security rules, helps meet regulatory compliance requirements,
and fosters a security-conscious culture.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Timeline:</strong> Immediate (within 30 days).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="informational-recommendations">Informational
Recommendations</h2>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="maintain-strong-network-perimeter-security">2. Maintain Strong
Network Perimeter Security</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> The current restrictive firewall
configuration is excellent. Continue to maintain and regularly audit
this configuration. Ensure a formal change management process is used
for any modifications to firewall rules.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Preserves the strong defensive posture
against external network-based attacks and prevents accidental exposure
of internal services.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Timeline:</strong> Ongoing.</p></li>
