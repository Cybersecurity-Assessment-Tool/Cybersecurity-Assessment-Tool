<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">1. Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity assessment for
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on an analysis of network
scan data, organizational security controls, and pre-existing risk
documentation.</p>
<p>The assessment reveals a mixed security posture. The organization
demonstrates strong identity and access management controls, with
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) widely implemented across email,
computers, and sensitive systems. This significantly reduces the risk of
unauthorized access through compromised credentials.</p>
<p>However, several critical and high-risk issues were identified that
require immediate attention:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Critical Finding:</strong> An external scan of the target
IP <code>[Target IP]</code> discovered an open port
(<code>8080/tcp</code>) hosting a web service with the title
<strong>“TOP SECRET DB”</strong>. This suggests a potentially exposed
and highly sensitive database interface. This finding directly
contradicts previous risk documentation which classified this port as a
secure false positive.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>High-Risk Gaps:</strong> Significant gaps exist in
administrative controls. The organization lacks a formal employee
acceptable use policy and does not provide security awareness training
for new hires. These deficiencies create a high-risk environment for
insider threats, social engineering, and accidental data
exposure.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Immediate action is required to investigate and secure the exposed
service on port <code>8080</code> and to implement foundational
administrative security policies to mitigate human-centric risks.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="organizational-information">2. Organizational

Review (Questionnaire Analysis)</h1>
<p>The following table summarizes the organization’s self-reported
security controls. While MFA implementation is commendable, the
identified gaps in policy and training represent significant risks.</p>

&amp; &amp; <span style="color: low"><strong>Good

</p>
</div>
<p>The absence of an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) means there are no
formal rules governing how employees use company assets, which can lead
to misuse and security incidents. The lack of security training for new
hires leaves the organization vulnerable, as new employees are often
prime targets for phishing and social engineering attacks.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of
Technical Findings</h2>
<p>The discovery of a web service titled <strong>“TOP SECRET
DB”</strong> is a finding of the highest criticality. This title
strongly implies that a sensitive, potentially classified, database is
accessible from the public internet. This contradicts the information
from the existing risk register (<em>Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON</em>),
which states this port is a "confirmed secure and false positive." This
discrepancy suggests that either the previous assessment was incorrect,
or a new, highly sensitive service has been deployed without proper
security review.</p>
