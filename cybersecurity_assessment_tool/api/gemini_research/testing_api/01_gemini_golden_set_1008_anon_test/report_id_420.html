<h1 id="executive-overview">Executive Overview</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment for . The analysis is based on a security controls
questionnaire. It is critical to note that the provided network scan
data and the list of current organizational risks were corrupted and
could not be processed. This report is therefore limited to an analysis
of self-reported security controls.</p>
<p>The assessment identified several critical and high-risk security
gaps. The most severe findings are the lack of multi-factor
authentication (MFA) for email access and computer logins. These gaps
expose the organization to significant risks, including business email
compromise, ransomware attacks, and unauthorized data access.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the absence of a structured security awareness training
program for new and existing employees indicates a systemic weakness in
the human element of the security framework. Employees are the first
line of defense, and without proper training, they are more susceptible
to phishing and social engineering attacks.</p>
<p>Immediate remediation of the identified critical risks is strongly
recommended to reduce the organization’s attack surface and improve its
overall security posture. A new technical vulnerability scan should be
conducted as a top priority to gain visibility into external-facing
security flaws.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-findings">Analysis of
Findings</h2>
<p>The review reveals critical deficiencies in identity and access
management, specifically concerning MFA. The lack of MFA on email and
computer logins are industry-recognized critical risks. While it is
positive that MFA is used for sensitive data systems, the primary entry
points for attackers (email and endpoints) remain unprotected.
Additionally, the complete absence of a security awareness training
program leaves the organization highly vulnerable to phishing, the
number one vector for initial access in cyberattacks.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis, the following prioritized actions are
recommended to mitigate the identified risks and strengthen the security
posture of .</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="priority-1-critical">Priority 1:
Critical</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email:</strong> Immediately enforce MFA
for all user mailboxes. This is the single most effective control to
prevent business email compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Endpoints:</strong> Deploy and enforce
MFA for all employee logins to workstations and laptops. This
significantly raises the difficulty for an attacker to compromise an
endpoint, even with valid credentials.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="priority-2-high">Priority 2: High</h2>
<ol start="3">
<li><p><strong>Establish a Security Awareness Program:</strong> Develop
and implement a mandatory security awareness training program. This must
include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Onboarding training for all new employees.</p></li>
<li><p>Annual refresher training for all staff.</p></li>
<li><p>Regular phishing simulations to test and reinforce
learning.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="priority-3-administrative-technical">Priority
3: Administrative / Technical</h2>
<ol start="4">
<li><p><strong>Conduct a New Network Scan:</strong> Commission a new,
authenticated external and internal vulnerability scan to identify
technical vulnerabilities that were missed due to the corrupted
data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Maintain a Risk Register:</strong> Formally document the
risks identified in this report in an organizational risk register and
establish a process for tracking their remediation.</p></li>
