<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity assessment for
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, synthesizing data from a technical
network scan, a security controls questionnaire, and a review of
pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The assessment reveals a mixed security posture. On a positive note,
the external network perimeter appears to be well-secured. A network
scan of the designated target IP address, <code>[Client IP]</code>,
found no open ports, suggesting a properly configured firewall that
effectively limits external attack vectors.</p>
<p>However, significant and critical vulnerabilities were identified in
the organization’s internal security policies and identity management
practices. The lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for critical
systems like email and computer logins presents a critical risk of
account compromise and unauthorized access. Furthermore, the absence of
a formal Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and a mandatory annual security
awareness training program for all employees creates a high-risk
environment where human error can easily lead to security incidents.</p>
<p>Immediate action is required to address these policy and
identity-related gaps to prevent potential breaches stemming from
phishing, credential theft, or insider threats. Recommendations are
detailed in Section <a href="#sec:recommendations"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:recommendations">6</a>.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-gaps">Analysis of Gaps</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA Deficiencies:</strong> The lack of MFA on email and
computer logins is a critical vulnerability. Email is a primary target
for phishing attacks, and a compromised account can lead to widespread
data breaches and further system compromise. Similarly, unprotected
computer logins remove a vital layer of defense against unauthorized
physical or remote access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Policy and Training Gaps:</strong> The absence of an
Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) means there are no formal guidelines for
employees on how to handle company data and resources securely. This,
combined with the lack of annual security training, significantly
increases the risk of accidental data exposure, malware infections, and
non-compliance.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network port scan was conducted using Nmap to identify accessible
services on the organization’s external-facing infrastructure.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong> (Placeholder used as target
was not specified in scan data)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Status:</strong> The target host was found to be
online and responsive.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Findings:</strong> The scan reported that all 65,535 TCP
ports were in a <code>closed</code> state. No open ports or active
services were detected.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="interpretation">Interpretation</h2>
<p>The absence of open ports is a strong positive security finding. It
indicates that the perimeter firewall is configured to a "default deny"
policy, which is a security best practice. This configuration
significantly reduces the external attack surface, making it difficult
for attackers to directly probe for vulnerable services.</p>
<h1 id="consolidated-risk-assessment">Consolidated Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section correlates the findings from the security control
review, technical scan, and pre-existing risk data. As no pre-existing
vulnerabilities were reported, the risks below are derived solely from
this assessment.</p>

<h1 id="sec:recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the consolidated risk assessment, the following actionable
recommendations are provided to improve the security posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Comprehensive MFA (Priority:
Critical)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Enforce MFA for all users on all
critical systems, starting immediately with email (e.g., Office 365,
Google Workspace) and computer logins (e.g., via Windows Hello for
Business, Duo).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Drastically reduces the risk of account
compromise from stolen credentials, which is the leading cause of data
breaches.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)
(Priority: High)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Draft a formal AUP that clearly defines
the rules for using company IT assets, data handling, internet usage,
and security responsibilities. This policy must be communicated to all
employees and acknowledged via signature.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Establishes a clear security baseline
for all employees, reduces legal liability, and provides a framework for
enforcing security standards.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish an Annual Security Awareness Training Program
(Priority: High)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Implement a mandatory security awareness
training program for all employees to be completed at least once per
year. The training should cover topics such as phishing identification,
password security, data handling, and incident reporting.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Creates a security-conscious culture and
empowers employees to become the first line of defense against common
cyber threats like phishing and social engineering.</p></li>
</ul></li>
