<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report presents a cybersecurity assessment for
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, conducted on 2026-01-31. The
analysis is based on a review of organizational security controls, an
external network scan, and a list of pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The assessment identified two significant areas of concern requiring
immediate attention. The most critical finding is the absence of
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access, which exposes the
organization to a high risk of Business Email Compromise (BEC) and
unauthorized account access. Additionally, the lack of mandatory annual
security awareness training for all employees constitutes a high risk,
as it diminishes the organization’s resilience against phishing and
social engineering attacks.</p>
<p>On a positive note, the organization has implemented foundational
controls, including MFA for computer and sensitive system access, an
acceptable use policy, and security training for new hires. The external
network scan of the target host <code>[Target IP]</code> did not reveal
any open ports, suggesting a properly configured firewall or that the
host was unresponsive at the time of the scan. No pre-existing
vulnerabilities were provided for this assessment.</p>
<p>Recommendations are detailed in Section <a
href="#sec:recommendations" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:recommendations">6</a> and are prioritized to
address the most critical risks first.</p>

<p>A review of organizational security controls was conducted based on a
standard questionnaire. The responses indicate key strengths and
weaknesses in the current security posture. Gaps identified with a ‘No‘
() response are correlated with findings in the Risk Assessment
section.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external, unauthenticated network scan was performed against the
designated target IP address.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP:</strong> <code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> [Scan Date Not Provided]</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="scan-summary">Scan Summary</h2>
<p>The scan did not identify any open TCP or UDP ports on the target
host. This result typically indicates one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The presence of a well-configured firewall that is effectively
blocking all unsolicited inbound traffic. - The host was offline or not
responsive to network probes at the time of the scan. - An Intrusion
Prevention System (IPS) may have blocked the scan traffic.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>No vulnerabilities could be identified from this external
perspective. Further internal, authenticated scanning is recommended for
a more comprehensive technical assessment.</p>
<h1 id="consolidated-risk-assessment">Consolidated Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes findings from the security control review,

<h1 id="sec:recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following prioritized recommendations are provided to mitigate
the identified risks and improve the overall security posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="priority-1-critical">Priority 1: Critical</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Remediate RISK-001:</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>Enforce MFA for all Email Accounts.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediately enable and enforce MFA for
all user mailboxes. Prioritize accounts with access to sensitive
information or financial systems, such as executives and finance
department personnel.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> This is the single most effective
control to prevent unauthorized access to email accounts and mitigate
the threat of Business Email Compromise (BEC).</p></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="priority-2-high">Priority 2: High</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Remediate RISK-002:</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>Implement Annual Security Awareness Training.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Establish a mandatory security awareness
training program for all employees, to be completed annually. The
training should cover key topics such as phishing, password security,
and acceptable use policies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> A well-informed workforce is a
critical layer of defense. Regular training reinforces security best
practices and reduces the organization’s susceptibility to
human-targeted attacks.</p></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="priority-3-informational">Priority 3: Informational</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Enhance Technical Visibility:</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>Conduct Authenticated Vulnerability Scanning.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Schedule regular internal and external
authenticated vulnerability scans against critical infrastructure. An
authenticated scan logs into systems to provide a much deeper and more
accurate view of software vulnerabilities and
misconfigurations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> While the external scan was
clean, it only provides an outside-in view. Authenticated scans are
necessary to identify vulnerabilities that are not exposed to the public
internet but could be exploited by an attacker who gains internal
access.</p></li>
