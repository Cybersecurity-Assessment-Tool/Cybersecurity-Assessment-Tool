<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">1. Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the cybersecurity
posture for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The assessment is
based on a correlation of data from an external network scan, a review
of internal security controls via a questionnaire, and an analysis of
pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The external network scan of the target host <code>[Target IP]</code>
revealed a strong security posture. No open ports were detected, and all
other scanned ports were found to be in a ’closed’ state. This indicates
effective firewall configuration and perimeter defense against
unsolicited network traffic.</p>
<p>However, the security controls review identified a significant policy
gap. While the organization has implemented strong controls for
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and has a baseline for new employee
training, there is a lack of mandatory, annual security awareness
training for all employees. This oversight is classified as a
<strong>High</strong> risk, as it increases the organization’s
susceptibility to human-centric threats such as phishing and social
engineering over time.</p>
<p>This report outlines the detailed findings and provides actionable
recommendations to mitigate the identified risk and further strengthen
the organization’s overall security posture.</p>

<p>A review of organizational security controls was conducted based on a

implemented policies and procedures. A "No" response indicates a
potential control gap that requires attention.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to identity and
access management through the comprehensive enforcement of Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA). Foundational policies like an Acceptable Use
Policy and new hire security training are also in place.</p>
<p>The critical finding is the absence of annual security awareness
training for all staff. Human behavior is a key factor in security.
Without regular reinforcement, employees are more likely to forget best
practices, fall victim to evolving phishing tactics, and inadvertently
expose the organization to risk. This gap undermines the effectiveness
of technical controls.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">4. Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed to identify accessible
services and potential vulnerabilities on the organization’s
perimeter.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> 2026-01-30</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Used:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="findings">Findings</h2>
<p>The scan results were positive, indicating a very secure external
network posture for the assessed host.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> Up</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports:</strong> 0 (None Detected)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Filtered/Closed Ports:</strong> All 1000 scanned ports
were reported as ’closed’.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-1">Analysis</h2>
<p>The absence of any open ports suggests that the external firewall is
correctly configured to deny all unsolicited inbound traffic by default
(principle of least privilege). This significantly reduces the attack
surface available to external adversaries and is considered a best
practice for network security.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment-summary">5. Risk Assessment
Summary</h1>
<p>This section consolidates risks identified from the security control
review, technical scans, and pre-existing vulnerability data. In this
assessment, no pre-existing vulnerabilities were reported, and no
technical vulnerabilities were discovered. The primary risk stems from
the identified policy gap.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Maintain Strong Network Perimeter:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Continue the excellent practice of
maintaining a restrictive firewall policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Details:</strong> Regularly review firewall rules to
