<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity assessment
conducted for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The assessment
incorporated a review of organizational security controls via a
questionnaire, an external network scan, and a correlation with
pre-existing risk data.</p>
<p>The analysis revealed two significant, high-impact security gaps in
organizational policy and procedure. The lack of mandatory Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for email access represents a <strong>critical
risk</strong>, exposing the organization to Business Email Compromise
(BEC) and account takeover attacks. Additionally, the absence of annual
security awareness training for all employees constitutes a <strong>high
risk</strong>, as it allows security knowledge to degrade over time,
making staff more susceptible to social engineering attacks.</p>
<p>On the technical front, an external network scan of the target IP
address <code>[Target IP]</code> showed no open ports. This is a
positive security finding. Notably, this result contradicts a
pre-existing documented risk concerning an "Unencrypted Web Server" on
Port 80. The scan indicates that this port is currently closed,
suggesting the risk may have been remediated or was a false
positive.</p>
<p>Recommendations are prioritized to address the most critical findings
first: immediate implementation of MFA for email, followed by the
establishment of a recurring security training program.</p>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A security questionnaire was completed to evaluate the current state
of administrative and policy-based controls. The results are summarized
below.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-control-gaps">Analysis of Control
Gaps</h2>
<p>The questionnaire identified two significant control
deficiencies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>No MFA for Email:</strong> Email is a primary target for
attackers. Without MFA, a compromised password is all that is needed for
an attacker to gain access to an employee’s mailbox, which can lead to
data breaches, financial fraud, and further infiltration of the network.
This is considered a critical gap.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Annual Security Awareness Training:</strong> While
training for new hires is in place, the lack of a recurring, annual
training program for all staff is a high-risk oversight. The threat
landscape evolves continuously, and employee knowledge must be refreshed
to remain effective against modern phishing and social engineering
tactics.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed using Nmap to identify open
ports and exposed services on the designated target system.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="scan-details">Scan Details</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP:</strong> <code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>

<li><p><strong>Scan Type:</strong> TCP Connect Scan</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="findings">Findings</h2>
<p>The scan reported the target host as "up," but found no open TCP
ports. The status of a key port is detailed below.</p>

</div>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of
Technical Findings</h2>
<p>The scan results are positive from a security perspective, as no
services were found to be exposed to the public internet on the scanned
host.</p>
<p><strong>Important Correlation Note:</strong> A pre-existing risk on
file, "Unencrypted Web Server," states that Port 80 is open. This scan’s
finding that Port 80 is <strong>closed</strong> directly contradicts the
existing risk data. This suggests one of the following
possibilities:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The vulnerability has been successfully remediated since it was
last assessed.</p></li>
<li><p>The original finding was a false positive.</p></li>
<li><p>The scan was performed against a different IP than the one
associated with the risk.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Further investigation is required to formally close or re-validate
the pre-existing risk.</p>
<h1 id="consolidated-risk-assessment">Consolidated Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>The following table synthesizes findings from the security control
review, technical scan, and pre-existing risk documentation into a
consolidated list.</p>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the consolidated risk assessment, the following actions are
recommended, ordered by priority.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Priority 1 (Critical):</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>Implement MFA for Email.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Enforce mandatory Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) across all email accounts immediately.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> This is the single most effective
control to prevent unauthorized access to email and mitigate the risk of
Business Email Compromise (BEC).</p></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Priority 2 (High):</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>Establish Annual Security Awareness Training.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop or procure a security awareness
training program and mandate its completion by all employees on an
annual basis. The training should cover phishing, password security, and
acceptable use policies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> A well-trained workforce is a
critical layer of defense. Regular training ensures that security
remains a top-of-mind concern for all staff.</p></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Priority 3 (Medium):</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>Investigate and Resolve Port 80 Risk
Discrepancy.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Review asset management records to
confirm the IP address of the web server associated with risk R-03.
Re-scan the confirmed IP if different. If the port is confirmed to be
closed on the correct asset, update the risk register to formally close
the finding.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> Maintaining an accurate risk
register is essential for focusing remediation efforts where they are
most needed. This action will clarify the true state of the external
perimeter.</p></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The overall security posture of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>
can be significantly improved by addressing the identified procedural
and policy-based gaps. While the external network perimeter appears
secure based on the recent scan, the lack of foundational controls like
MFA on email and recurring security training presents a substantial and
immediate risk to the organization.</p>
<p>We strongly advise prioritizing the implementation of the
recommendations outlined in this report to build a more resilient and
secure operational environment.</p>
