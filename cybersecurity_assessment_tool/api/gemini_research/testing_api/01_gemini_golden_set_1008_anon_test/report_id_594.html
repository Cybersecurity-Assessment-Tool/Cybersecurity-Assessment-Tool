<h1 id="executive-overview">Executive Overview</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the cybersecurity
posture for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on data gathered
from a network scan, a security controls questionnaire, and a review of
pre-existing risks. The assessment aims to identify vulnerabilities,
procedural gaps, and misconfigurations that could expose the
organization to cyber threats.</p>
<h4 id="key-findings">Key Findings:</h4>
<p>The assessment reveals a mixed security posture. On a positive note,
the external network scan of the target IP address
<code>[Target IP]</code> did not identify any open ports. This indicates
that a previously identified risk, an "Unencrypted Web Server" on Port
80, appears to have been successfully remediated. This is a significant
improvement in the external security perimeter.</p>
<p>However, a critical security gap was identified through the
organizational questionnaire. The lack of mandatory Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for logging into company computers represents a
high-severity risk. This weakness could allow an attacker with
compromised credentials to gain initial access to the internal network,
bypass other security controls, and potentially escalate privileges to
access sensitive data.</p>
<h4 id="summary">Summary:</h4>
<p>While the organization demonstrates a strong external posture and
good adherence to security policies like employee training, the absence
of endpoint MFA is a critical vulnerability. Recommendations in this
report are prioritized to address this gap immediately to prevent
unauthorized access and protect critical assets.</p>

<h4 id="analysis">Analysis:</h4>
<p>The questionnaire reveals a significant gap in endpoint security. The
absence of MFA for computer logins is a critical weakness. If an
employee’s password is stolen, lost, or cracked, there is no secondary
authentication factor to prevent an attacker from logging directly into
their workstation. This provides a direct entry point into the corporate
network, from which an attacker can perform reconnaissance, move
laterally, and escalate privileges. All other responses indicate that
foundational security policies and training are in place, which is
commendable.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed to identify open ports and
exposed services.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="scan-findings">Scan Findings</h2>
<p>The scan results were positive from a security perspective. No open
ports were detected on the target host. The host was responsive, but all
common ports, including those for web (80, 443), email (25, 110), and
remote access (22, 3389), were found to be in a <code>closed</code> or
<code>filtered</code> state.</p>
<h4 id="notable-finding-port-80-http">Notable Finding: Port 80
(HTTP)</h4>
<p>Specifically, Port 80, which was listed as a concern in the
pre-existing risk register, was confirmed to be <strong>closed</strong>.
This technical finding suggests that the risk of an unencrypted web
server has been successfully mitigated.</p>

<h4 id="risk-correlation-analysis">Risk Correlation Analysis:</h4>
<p>The primary active risk is the lack of MFA on workstations,
identified from the questionnaire. The technical scan data directly
contradicts the pre-existing risk of an "Unencrypted Web Server,"
indicating that this risk is no longer active and can be closed. This is
a positive outcome, demonstrating progress in securing the network
perimeter. The focus must now shift to strengthening internal and
endpoint security controls.</p>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended to
improve the organization’s cybersecurity posture. Recommendations are
prioritized by severity.</p>
<h2 id="priority-1-implement-mfa-for-endpoint-logins-critical">Priority
1: Implement MFA for Endpoint Logins (Critical)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Deploy a mandatory Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) solution for all employee logins to workstations,
laptops, and servers. This should apply to both on-premise and remote
access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> This is the most effective single
control to mitigate the risk of account takeover. Even if an attacker
obtains a user’s password, they will be unable to access the system
without the second factor (e.g., a code from a mobile app, a physical
security key).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Suggested Solutions:</strong> Solutions like Windows
Hello for Business, Duo Security, or Okta can be integrated with Active
Directory or other identity providers to enforce this control.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2
id="priority-2-update-internal-risk-register-administrative">Priority 2:
Update Internal Risk Register (Administrative)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Formally mark the risk titled
"Unencrypted Web Server" as "Remediated" or "Closed" in the
organization’s internal risk tracking system.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> The technical scan confirmed that
Port 80 is closed, mitigating the risk. Maintaining an accurate and
up-to-date risk register is crucial for focusing resources on current
and relevant threats.</p></li>
