<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment conducted for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The
assessment combined a review of organizational security controls, an
external network scan, and an analysis of pre-existing risks to provide
a comprehensive overview of the organization’s security posture.</p>
<p>The external network scan of the designated target IP address
revealed a strong perimeter defense, with no open ports detected. This
indicates a well-configured firewall or a lack of exposed services at
the scanned address, which is a positive security finding.</p>
<p>However, the review of organizational security controls identified
two significant gaps that present a high level of risk. A
<strong>Critical</strong> risk was identified due to the absence of
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. Additionally, a
<strong>High</strong> risk was identified from the lack of a formal
Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). These policy and procedural
weaknesses could expose the organization to significant threats, such as
unauthorized access and insider threats, despite the strong network
perimeter.</p>
<p>This report provides detailed findings and actionable recommendations
to mitigate the identified risks and enhance the overall security
posture of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>

<p>An external network scan was performed to identify exposed services
and potential vulnerabilities on the organization’s public-facing
infrastructure.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP:</strong></p></li>

and determined the host was online. No open ports were discovered on the
target system. All 1000 scanned ports were reported as
<code>closed</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Analyst Notes:</strong> A finding of no open ports is a
strong indicator of a well-configured firewall and a hardened external
posture for this specific asset. This significantly reduces the external
attack surface.</p></li>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the findings of this assessment, the following actions are
recommended to mitigate identified risks and improve the overall
security posture.</p>
<h2 id="priority-critical">Priority: Critical</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Logins:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) for all user logins to company-managed computers (desktops and
laptops).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> This is one of the most effective
controls to prevent unauthorized access resulting from compromised
credentials. It protects endpoints, which are the gateway to the
internal network and sensitive data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Suggested Solutions:</strong> Windows Hello for Business,
Duo Security, Okta, or other enterprise-grade MFA providers.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="priority-high">Priority: High</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Create a formal AUP that clearly defines
the rules and expectations for all employees when using company
technology, network resources, and data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> An AUP is a foundational
governance document that reduces organizational risk, sets a baseline
for user behavior, and provides a framework for enforcing security
policies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implementation:</strong> The policy should be reviewed by
management, published, and distributed to all employees. A signed
acknowledgment should be collected from each employee to ensure
awareness.</p></li>
</ul></li>
