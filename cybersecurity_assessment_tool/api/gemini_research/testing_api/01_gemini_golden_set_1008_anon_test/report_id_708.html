<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides an assessment of the cybersecurity posture for
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The analysis is based on a review
of organizational security controls provided via questionnaire. It is
critical to note that the technical network scan data
(<code>Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON</code>) and the list of pre-existing
risks (<code>Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON</code>) were corrupted and could
not be processed. This inability to assess the external attack surface
constitutes a significant visibility gap and is a finding in itself.</p>
<p>The review of organizational controls revealed several high-risk and
critical-risk gaps that require immediate attention. The most critical
finding is the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email
access, which exposes the organization to a high likelihood of business
email compromise (BEC), phishing, and account takeover attacks.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the absence of an employee Acceptable Use Policy and a
mandatory annual security awareness training program indicates
foundational weaknesses in the organization’s security culture and
governance. These gaps collectively create an environment where
employees may be more susceptible to social engineering attacks.</p>
<p>Urgent remediation is recommended to address these deficiencies to
reduce the organization’s risk profile and improve its overall defensive
capabilities.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following details were used as the basis for this assessment. As
per the instructions, placeholders are used where data was not provided
in the input.</p>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>The following table details the responses from the organizational
security questionnaire. "No" answers indicate significant gaps in the

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was attempted as part of this assessment.
However, the resulting data file was found to be corrupted and could not
be parsed.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Unavailable (Corrupted Data)</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="open-ports-and-services">Open Ports and Services</h2>
<p><strong>No data available.</strong> The network scan data was
incomplete, preventing an analysis of the external attack surface. It is
not possible to determine which ports are open or what services are
exposed to the internet. This lack of visibility is a significant
security risk, as unmonitored or misconfigured services are a common
entry point for attackers.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>The following table summarizes the key risks identified during this
assessment, derived from the security control review. The severity is
rated based on the potential impact and likelihood of exploitation.</p>

<h2 id="pre-existing-risks">Pre-Existing Risks</h2>
<p>The input data source for current and pre-existing vulnerabilities
(<code>Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON</code>) was also found to be broken.
Therefore, no previously tracked risks could be incorporated into this
report’s analysis.</p>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the findings, the following actions are recommended to
mitigate the identified risks and improve the overall security posture
of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. Recommendations are prioritized
by severity.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>[CRITICAL] Implement MFA for Email
(ORG-001):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Immediately enforce a policy requiring MFA for all user access to
the email system (e.g., O365, Google Workspace).</p></li>
<li><p>Prioritize robust MFA methods such as authenticator apps or
hardware tokens over less secure methods like SMS.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct a review of all email accounts for signs of existing
compromise.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>[HIGH] Establish Annual Security Training
(ORG-002):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Procure and deploy a security awareness training
platform.</p></li>
<li><p>Develop a mandatory annual training curriculum for all employees
covering key topics like phishing, password security, and social
engineering.</p></li>
<li><p>Track completion to ensure 100% compliance.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>[HIGH] Develop and Implement an AUP
(ORG-003):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Draft a comprehensive Acceptable Use Policy that clearly defines
the rules for using company networks, devices, and data.</p></li>
<li><p>Have the policy reviewed by legal and HR departments.</p></li>
<li><p>Require all current and new employees to read and formally
acknowledge the policy.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>[HIGH] Remediate Scan Failures and Schedule Regular Scans
(SYS-001):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Investigate and resolve the technical issues that prevented the
network scan from completing successfully.</p></li>
<li><p>Establish a formal vulnerability management program that
includes, at a minimum, quarterly external vulnerability scans.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure a process is in place to review scan results and remediate
identified vulnerabilities in a timely manner.</p></li>
</ul></li>
