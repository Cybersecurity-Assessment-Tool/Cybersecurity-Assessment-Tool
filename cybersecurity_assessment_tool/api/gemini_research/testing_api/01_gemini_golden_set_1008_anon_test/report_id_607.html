<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a cybersecurity assessment for
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on an analysis of network
scan data, a security controls questionnaire, and a review of
pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The assessment reveals a mixed security posture. While foundational
controls like Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer
access are in place, several critical and high-risk gaps were
identified. The most significant concerns are the lack of MFA for
sensitive data systems and the absence of a formal security awareness
training program for employees.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a technical scan identified an exposed administrative
service (SSH on port 22) on the external network perimeter. When
combined with the identified policy gaps, this technical finding
elevates the risk of unauthorized access and potential data
compromise.</p>
<p>Immediate remediation is recommended to address these
vulnerabilities, focusing on implementing comprehensive MFA,
establishing a security training program, and securing the exposed
network service.</p>

<h4 id="analysis">Analysis:</h4>
<p>The lack of MFA on sensitive data systems represents a critical
security gap. This control is essential for protecting the
organization’s most valuable assets. Additionally, the complete absence
of a security awareness training program leaves the organization highly
vulnerable to social engineering and phishing attacks, which are primary
vectors for initial compromise.</p>

<h4 id="analysis-1">Analysis:</h4>
<p>The scan identified that port 22 (SSH - Secure Shell) is open to the
public internet. SSH is a common protocol for remote server
administration. While necessary for management, its public exposure
makes it a prime target for automated brute-force attacks and
exploitation if vulnerabilities exist. The scan did not retrieve version
information, which prevents a specific check for known vulnerabilities
(CVEs). However, any publicly exposed administrative interface should be
considered a significant risk.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified
risks and improve the overall security posture of the organization.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>[Critical] Implement MFA on Sensitive Systems:</strong>
Immediately prioritize the deployment of Multi-Factor Authentication on
all systems classified as containing sensitive data. This is the single
most effective control to prevent unauthorized access resulting from
compromised credentials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>[High] Establish a Security Awareness Training
Program:</strong> Develop and implement a mandatory security awareness
training program. This program must include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Onboarding training for all new employees before they are granted
system access.</p></li>
<li><p>Annual refresher training for all staff to keep them informed of
current threats.</p></li>
<li><p>Regular phishing simulations to test and reinforce employee
vigilance.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>[High] Secure the Exposed SSH Port:</strong> Restrict
access to the public-facing SSH service. The preferred methods are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Use a firewall to limit access to a whitelist of trusted IP
addresses (e.g., corporate office or VPN).</p></li>
<li><p>Enforce strong, key-based authentication and completely disable
password-based authentication for SSH.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>[Informational] Conduct In-Depth Vulnerability
Scanning:</strong> Perform an authenticated and unauthenticated
vulnerability scan across the external perimeter and internal network.
This will provide detailed service version information and identify
specific Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that require
patching.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>This assessment has identified significant and actionable risks to
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. While some security controls are
in place, the gaps related to MFA and security training, combined with
the exposed administrative service, create a high-risk environment. We
strongly advise that the organization’s leadership review these findings
and allocate the necessary resources to implement the provided
recommendations in a timely manner.</p>
