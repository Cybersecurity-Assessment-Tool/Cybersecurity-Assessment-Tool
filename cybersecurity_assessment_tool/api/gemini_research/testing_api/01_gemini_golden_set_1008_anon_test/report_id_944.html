<h1 id="executive-overview">Executive Overview</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity assessment
conducted for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The assessment
incorporated a review of organizational security controls, an external
network scan, and an analysis of pre-existing risk data.</p>
<p>The overall security posture reveals several critical and high-risk
gaps that require immediate attention. The most significant finding is
the <strong>lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email
access</strong>, which exposes the organization to a high likelihood of
account compromise and subsequent data breaches.</p>
<p>Furthermore, foundational security policies, such as an Acceptable
Use Policy and mandatory annual security training for all staff, are not
in place. These policy gaps create an environment where security
incidents are more likely to occur due to human error.</p>
<p>Technically, the external network scan identified an open port for
unencrypted web traffic (HTTP), which poses a risk of data interception.
Addressing these correlated findings should be the top priority to
materially improve the organization’s defensive posture.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following details were used as the basis for this assessment. Due
to the anonymized nature of the provided data, placeholders have been
used where necessary.</p>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A review of organizational security controls was conducted based on a
standardized questionnaire. The responses indicate a mix of implemented
controls and significant gaps. The table below summarizes the findings.
A () indicates a positive control is in place, while a () indicates a
control gap.</p>

</div>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-control-gaps">Analysis of Control
Gaps</h2>
<p>The identified gaps represent significant risks:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>No MFA for Email:</strong> <strong>(Critical
Risk)</strong> Email is a primary target for attackers. Without MFA, a
compromised password is all that is needed to gain access to sensitive
communications, impersonate employees, and launch further attacks
against the organization and its partners.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> <strong>(High
Risk)</strong> An AUP sets clear expectations for how employees may use
company resources. Its absence can lead to misuse of assets and creates
ambiguity during incident response or HR actions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Annual Security Training:</strong> <strong>(High
Risk)</strong> The threat landscape evolves constantly. Failing to
provide annual refresher training means employees’ security awareness
degrades over time, making them more susceptible to phishing and social
engineering attacks.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network vulnerability scan was performed on the target IP
address. The scan was non-intrusive and aimed to identify open ports and
exposed services.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> The scan date was not provided in the
scan metadata.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="open-ports-and-services">Open Ports and
Services</h2>
<p>The scan identified the following open port:</p>

</div>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="technical-analysis">Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>The presence of an open Port 80/HTTP is a significant finding. HTTP
is an unencrypted protocol, meaning any data transmitted between a
user’s browser and the web server can be intercepted and read by an
attacker on the same network (e.g., public Wi-Fi). This includes login
credentials, session cookies, and other sensitive information. Best
practice dictates that all web traffic should be encrypted using HTTPS
(Port 443).</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actionable recommendations are provided to mitigate the
identified risks. They are prioritized to address the most critical
issues first.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="immediate-priority-implement-within-7-days">Immediate Priority
(Implement within 7 days)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Enforce MFA on All Email Accounts:</strong> Immediately
enable and enforce MFA for all user mailboxes. This is the single most
effective control to prevent unauthorized access to email.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="high-priority-implement-within-30-days">High
Priority (Implement within 30 days)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement HTTPS and Disable HTTP:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Obtain and install a TLS/SSL certificate for the service running
on <code>[Target IP]</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Configure the web server to redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS
(Port 443).</p></li>
<li><p>If possible, block Port 80 at the firewall once redirection is
confirmed to be working.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="medium-priority-implement-within-90-days">Medium Priority (Implement
within 90 days)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a formal AUP document that all employees must
read and sign. This policy should clearly define the rules for using
company IT assets, data, and internet access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish an Annual Security Awareness Training
Program:</strong> Implement a mandatory, recurring security awareness
training program for all employees. The training should be conducted at
least once per year and cover current threats such as phishing, malware,
and social engineering.</p></li>
