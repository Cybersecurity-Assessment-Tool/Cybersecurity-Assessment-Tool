<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity assessment for
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, synthesizing data from a network
vulnerability scan, a security controls questionnaire, and a review of
pre-existing risk documentation.</p>
<p>The assessment revealed a mixed security posture. On the technical
front, the external network scan of the designated target IP address did
not identify any open ports, which is a positive security finding. This
result suggests that a previously identified risk concerning an
unencrypted web server may have been remediated.</p>
<p>However, significant and critical gaps were identified in the
organization’s procedural and access control security layers. The lack
of mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer and
sensitive data system access represents a high-impact vulnerability.
Furthermore, the absence of a structured security awareness training
program for employees exposes the organization to a high likelihood of
social engineering and phishing attacks.</p>
<p>Immediate remediation efforts should focus on implementing robust
access controls (MFA) and establishing a comprehensive security
awareness training program to mitigate these critical risks.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>

</div>
<p>The analysis of the security controls highlights critical
deficiencies in identity and access management and security awareness.
The absence of MFA on endpoints and sensitive systems drastically
increases the risk of unauthorized access from compromised credentials.
The lack of security training leaves the organization’s staff, the
"human firewall," vulnerable to common attack vectors.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed to identify open ports and
exposed services on the organization’s perimeter.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Status:</strong> The target host was found to be
online (’up’).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Findings:</strong> The scan completed successfully and
found <strong>no open ports</strong>. Port 80 (HTTP) was explicitly
checked and found to be <strong>closed</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of
Technical Findings</h2>
<p>The results of the network scan are positive. A minimal external
attack surface significantly reduces the risk of network-based
intrusions.</p>
<p>Notably, the finding that port 80 is closed contradicts a
pre-existing risk documented in Input 3 ("Unencrypted Web Server"). This
suggests that the risk has been successfully remediated or was based on
outdated information. This is a positive development that should be
formally verified and documented.</p>

actions are recommended to improve the organization’s cybersecurity
posture.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="priority-1-remediate-critical-risks">Priority
1: Remediate Critical Risks</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Comprehensive MFA:</strong> Enforce MFA across
all employee computer logins and for all applications and systems that
store or process sensitive data. This is the single most effective
control to prevent unauthorized access.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="priority-2-address-high-severity-risks">Priority 2: Address
High-Severity Risks</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Establish a Security Awareness Program:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop a mandatory security awareness training module for all
new employees during onboarding.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement a recurring, annual security awareness training program
for all staff.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct periodic phishing simulations to test and reinforce
training.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="priority-3-validate-and-document">Priority 3:
Validate and Document</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Verify Remediation of Port 80:</strong> Confirm with
system administrators that the closure of Port 80 on asset
<code>[Target IP]</code> was intentional. Conduct a broader review to
ensure no other public-facing systems are exposing unencrypted services,
and formally update risk documentation to reflect the
remediation.</p></li>
