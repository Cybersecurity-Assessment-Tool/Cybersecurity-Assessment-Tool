<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity assessment for
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, synthesizing data from a network
vulnerability scan, a security controls questionnaire, and a review of
pre-existing risks. The analysis was conducted to identify security
gaps, evaluate the current risk posture, and provide actionable
recommendations for remediation.</p>
<p>The assessment revealed several critical administrative control
deficiencies, primarily a widespread lack of Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) across email, workstations, and sensitive data systems. Another
significant gap was identified in the employee onboarding process, which
currently omits security awareness training for new hires. These issues
present a high risk of account compromise and unauthorized access.</p>
<p>On a positive note, the external network scan of the target IP
address <code>[Client IP]</code> did not identify any open ports. This
indicates a strong network perimeter security posture. Specifically, the
scan found that port 80 (HTTP) is closed, which contradicts a
pre-existing risk item. This suggests that a previously identified
vulnerability has been successfully remediated.</p>
<p>Our primary recommendations focus on the immediate implementation of
MFA and the integration of security training into the employee
onboarding process to mitigate the most severe risks.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>

organization for the scope of this assessment.</p>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>The following table summarizes the organization’s responses to a
security controls questionnaire. The responses are benchmarked against
standard cybersecurity best practices. Answers marked with (No)
represent significant gaps in the current security posture.</p>

Do you require MFA to access email? &amp;<br />
Do you require MFA to log into computers? &amp;<br />
Do you require MFA to access sensitive data systems? &amp;<br />
Does your organization have an employee acceptable use policy?
&amp;<br />
Does your organization do security awareness training for new employees?
&amp;<br />
Does your organization do security awareness training for all employees
at least once per year? &amp;<br />
</p>
</div>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-gaps">Analysis of Gaps</h2>
<p>The questionnaire reveals critical deficiencies in access control and
employee training:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> The
absence of MFA for email, computer logins, and sensitive systems is a
critical vulnerability. This significantly increases the risk of
unauthorized access via compromised credentials (e.g., through phishing
or password spraying attacks).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Onboarding Training Gap:</strong> The lack of security
awareness training for new employees leaves the organization vulnerable.
New hires are often targeted by social engineering attacks and may be
unaware of internal security policies and procedures.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed to identify open ports and
exposed services on the organization’s public-facing infrastructure.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not specified in scan data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Used:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="findings">Findings</h2>
<p>The scan confirmed that the target host is online (<strong>status:
up</strong>). However, no open ports were discovered during the scan.
The status of common ports is listed below.</p>

</div>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="technical-assessment">Technical
Assessment</h2>
<p>The absence of open ports on the scanned IP address indicates a
strong network perimeter configuration. This significantly reduces the
external attack surface. Notably, the finding that port 80 is closed
contradicts a pre-existing risk documented in the organization’s risk
register, suggesting successful remediation has occurred.</p>
<h1 id="consolidated-risk-assessment">Consolidated Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes findings from the security questionnaire,
technical scan, and pre-existing risk data into a consolidated list of
current risks.</p>
<div class="tabular">
<p><span>L<span>0.3</span> L<span>0.45</span> C<span>0.15</span></span>
<strong>Risk Name</strong> &amp; <strong>Overview</strong> &amp;
<strong>Severity</strong><br />
<strong>No MFA on Email</strong> &amp; Lack of a second authentication
factor for email access exposes the organization to account takeover and
business email compromise. &amp; <strong>Critical</strong><br />
<strong>No MFA on Workstations</strong> &amp; Absence of MFA for
computer logins allows an attacker with valid credentials to gain direct
access to endpoint systems and the internal network. &amp;
<strong>Critical</strong><br />
<strong>No MFA on Sensitive Data Systems</strong> &amp; Critical data is
accessible without MFA, creating a high risk of a significant data
breach if credentials are compromised. &amp;
<strong>Critical</strong><br />
<strong>Inadequate New Hire Training</strong> &amp; New employees are
not trained on security policies, making them more susceptible to social
engineering and accidental policy violations. &amp;
<strong>High</strong><br />
<strong>Unencrypted Web Server</strong> <em>(Pre-existing)</em> &amp;
Port 80 was believed to be open, exposing unencrypted web traffic.
<strong>Note:</strong> The current scan shows this port is closed. &amp;
<strong>Low (Remediated)</strong><br />

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following recommendations are prioritized based on risk severity
to help <strong>[Organization Name]</strong> improve its cybersecurity
posture.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="priority-1-implement-multi-factor-authentication-critical">Priority
1: Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (Critical)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Deploy a robust MFA solution across all
critical platforms immediately.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Details:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Email:</strong> Enforce MFA for all email accounts (e.g.,
via Microsoft 365, Google Workspace). This is the highest priority to
prevent business email compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sensitive Systems:</strong> Enforce MFA for all
applications and systems that store or process sensitive or regulated
data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Workstations &amp; VPN:</strong> Require MFA for all
remote access (VPN) and local computer logins to protect
endpoints.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="priority-2-enhance-security-awareness-program-high">Priority 2:
Enhance Security Awareness Program (High)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Integrate mandatory security awareness
training into the new employee onboarding process.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Details:</strong> Develop a training module for all new
hires that covers, at a minimum, the acceptable use policy, phishing
identification, password hygiene, and incident reporting procedures.
This should be a prerequisite for gaining access to company
systems.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="priority-3-update-risk-register-informational">Priority 3: Update
Risk Register (Informational)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Review and update the internal risk
register based on the findings of this report.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Details:</strong> The risk titled "Unencrypted Web
Server" related to Port 80 appears to be remediated, as confirmed by our
technical scan. We recommend formally closing this risk item after
internal verification.</p></li>
