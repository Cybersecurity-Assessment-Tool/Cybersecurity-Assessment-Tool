<p><strong>Cybersecurity Posture Assessment Report</strong>

<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive assessment of the cybersecurity
posture for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on an analysis
of organizational security controls, external network scan results, and
pre-existing risk data.</p>
<p>The assessment identified a significant disparity between the
organization’s external and internal security postures. The external
network perimeter appears strong, with a network scan revealing no open
ports on the target system. This indicates a well-configured firewall
and is a commendable security practice.</p>
<p>However, the review of internal security controls revealed several
critical and high-risk gaps. The absence of Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) for email and computer access represents a <strong>critical
vulnerability</strong>, exposing the organization to severe risks such
as business email compromise and unauthorized system access.
Furthermore, the lack of a formal Acceptable Use Policy and mandatory
security training for new employees creates a high-risk environment
susceptible to insider threats and human error.</p>
<p>This report outlines the detailed findings and provides actionable
recommendations to mitigate these identified risks and strengthen the
overall security framework.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following information was used as the basis for this assessment.

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A review of the organization’s security policies and procedures was
conducted via a questionnaire. The responses highlight key areas of
strength and weakness in the current security framework. Answers marked
with  indicate significant gaps that require immediate attention.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-controls">Analysis of
Controls</h2>
<p>The questionnaire results reveal critical deficiencies in identity
and access management and foundational security policies. While it is
positive that MFA is used for sensitive data systems and annual training
is conducted, the lack of MFA on core services like email and endpoint
logins, coupled with the absence of an Acceptable Use Policy and
new-hire training, creates an environment where security controls can be
easily bypassed.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed to identify open ports and
exposed services on the organization’s perimeter.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> [Scan Date Not Provided]</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Used:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="findings">Findings</h2>
<p>The scan concluded that the target host is online, but all scanned
ports were found to be in a <strong>closed</strong> state.</p>
<pre><code>Host is up.
All 1000 scanned ports on [Target IP] are in state: closed</code></pre>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of
Technical Findings</h2>
<p><strong>No open ports were discovered.</strong> This is a strong
positive finding. It indicates that the external firewall is properly
configured to deny unsolicited inbound traffic, significantly reducing
the external attack surface. This practice effectively protects against
opportunistic, automated attacks that scan for common vulnerable
services.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes the findings from the security control
review, technical scan, and pre-existing risk data. The primary risks
identified are procedural and policy-based rather than technical
vulnerabilities on the network perimeter.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actionable recommendations are provided to address the
identified risks. They are prioritized based on severity to guide
remediation efforts effectively.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="implement-comprehensive-multi-factor-authentication-critical">1.
Implement Comprehensive Multi-Factor Authentication (Critical)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Action:</strong> Enforce MFA for all user
access to email systems (e.g., Office 365, Google Workspace). This is
the single most effective control to prevent business email
compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Next Step:</strong> Deploy MFA for all remote access
solutions (VPN) and for logging into company-managed computers (e.g.,
via Windows Hello for Business, Duo, or a similar solution).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Goal:</strong> Ensure that no critical system relies
solely on a password for authentication.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="develop-and-enforce-an-acceptable-use-policy-high">2. Develop and
Enforce an Acceptable Use Policy (High)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Action:</strong> Draft a formal Acceptable Use
Policy (AUP) that clearly defines the rules for using company networks,
computers, email, and data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Next Step:</strong> Require all current employees to read
and formally acknowledge the new policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Goal:</strong> Integrate the AUP acknowledgement into the
new employee onboarding process to establish clear expectations from day
one.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="enhance-the-security-awareness-training-program-high">3. Enhance the
Security Awareness Training Program (High)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Action:</strong> Develop a security awareness
training module specifically for new hires. This module should be a
mandatory part of the onboarding process.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Content to Include:</strong> The training should cover
key topics such as phishing identification, password security, data
handling, and the newly created AUP.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Goal:</strong> Foster a culture of security throughout
the organization, starting from an employee’s first day. Continue with
annual refresher training to keep security top-of-mind.</p></li>
