<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a cybersecurity assessment for
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The analysis is based on a
security controls questionnaire. It is critical to note that the
provided network scan data (<code>Input_1</code>) and the list of
current risks (<code>Input_3</code>) were corrupted and could not be
processed. This represents a significant information gap, preventing a
full technical vulnerability assessment.</p>
<p>The primary findings from the available data reveal several critical
and high-risk gaps in the organization’s security controls. The most
severe issues are the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
accessing email and sensitive data systems. These gaps expose the
organization to significant risks of account compromise, data breaches,
and unauthorized access.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the absence of a formal Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and
the lack of mandatory annual security awareness training for all
employees create a permissive environment for insider threats and human
error.</p>
<p>Immediate remediation efforts should focus on implementing MFA across
all critical systems, developing and enforcing key security policies,
and establishing a recurring security training program. A comprehensive
external network scan must also be conducted as soon as possible to
identify and address technical vulnerabilities.</p>

<h4 id="analysis">Analysis:</h4>
<p>The questionnaire reveals critical deficiencies in authentication and
governance. The lack of MFA on email and sensitive systems are the most
urgent findings. While onboarding training is a good first step, the
absence of annual refresher training for all staff allows security
knowledge to become stale, increasing susceptibility to phishing and
social engineering attacks.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<h2 id="data-integrity-issue">Data Integrity Issue</h2>
<p>The network scan data provided for this assessment
(<code>Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON</code>) was found to be corrupted or
incomplete. As a result, a technical analysis of open ports, running
services, and potential vulnerabilities on the target host
(<code>[Target IP]</code>) could not be performed.</p>
<h2 id="implications">Implications</h2>
<p>This constitutes a major gap in the assessment. Without this data,
the organization’s external attack surface remains unknown. There is no
visibility into potential vulnerabilities such as outdated software,
misconfigured services, or exposed management interfaces that could be
exploited by external attackers.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment-findings">Risk Assessment &amp; Findings</h1>
<p>The following risk assessment is based solely on the findings from
the security control questionnaire due to the unavailability of
technical scan and pre-existing risk data. Each identified risk is
assigned a severity level based on its potential impact and
likelihood.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the findings, the following prioritized actions are
recommended to mitigate the identified risks and improve the
organization’s overall security posture.</p>
<h2 id="immediate-priority-0-30-days">Immediate Priority (0-30
Days)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA on Critical Systems:</strong> Immediately
enforce MFA for all user access to email platforms (e.g., Office 365,
Google Workspace) and all systems identified as containing sensitive
data. This is the single most effective control to mitigate the critical
risks identified.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="high-priority-30-90-days">High Priority (30-90 Days)</h2>
<ol start="2">
<li><p><strong>Conduct a New Network Vulnerability Scan:</strong>
Commission a new, comprehensive, and authenticated vulnerability scan of
all external-facing IP addresses and web applications. The results must
be analyzed and a remediation plan must be actioned
immediately.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a formal AUP that clearly defines the rules and
responsibilities for all employees when using company technology and
data. This policy must be communicated to all staff and formally
acknowledged.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish an Annual Security Training Program:</strong>
Implement a mandatory security awareness training program for all
employees to be completed annually. The training should cover current
threats such as phishing, ransomware, social engineering, and secure
data handling.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>While <strong>[Organization Name]</strong> has implemented some
foundational security measures, such as MFA for computer logins and
security training for new hires, there are critical and high-risk
deficiencies that require immediate attention. The lack of MFA on email
and sensitive data systems exposes the organization to an unacceptably
high risk of a major security incident.</p>
<p>By implementing the recommendations outlined in this
report—prioritizing MFA deployment, addressing policy gaps, and
obtaining visibility into the technical attack surface—the organization
can significantly strengthen its defenses and build a more resilient
security posture.</p>
