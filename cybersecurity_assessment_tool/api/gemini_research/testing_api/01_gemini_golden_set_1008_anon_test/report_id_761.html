<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the current
cybersecurity posture for , based on network scans, a security controls
questionnaire, and a review of pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The assessment reveals a <strong>Critical</strong> overall risk
level. The primary finding is the direct exposure of a Remote Desktop
Protocol (RDP) service on port 3389 to the public internet. This
vulnerability is severely compounded by a systemic lack of Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) across all critical systems, including email,
computer logins, and sensitive data access. Furthermore, the absence of
a consistent security awareness training program for employees
significantly increases the likelihood of a successful social
engineering or phishing attack, which could lead to credential
compromise.</p>
<p>The combination of these factors creates a direct and
high-probability pathway for a ransomware attack or significant data
breach. Immediate remediation is required to mitigate these risks and
protect organizational assets.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-control-gaps">Analysis of Control
Gaps</h2>
<p>The lack of MFA for email, computer, and data access is a critical
deficiency. It means that a single compromised password is all an
attacker needs to gain significant access to the network. The absence of
security awareness training makes employees highly susceptible to
phishing attacks designed to steal those passwords.</p>

<p>The exposure of RDP (port 3389) is a well-known and highly dangerous
configuration. It is one of the most common attack vectors for
ransomware groups, who continuously scan the internet for open RDP
ports. Attackers can use brute-force methods, credential stuffing, or
credentials stolen via phishing to gain direct, interactive control over
the exposed server. This provides a foothold to move laterally within
the internal network.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actionable recommendations are provided to mitigate the
identified risks. They are prioritized based on urgency and impact.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="immediate-actions-within-24-hours">Immediate
Actions (Within 24 Hours)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Close Port 3389:</strong> Immediately configure the
firewall protecting to block all inbound traffic on TCP port 3389 from
the internet. This is the single most important step to prevent an
imminent breach.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="high-priority-actions-within-30-days">High-Priority Actions (Within
30 Days)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA:</strong> Deploy Multi-Factor
Authentication across all remote access solutions, email platforms
(e.g., Office 365, Google Workspace), and systems containing sensitive
data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Secure Remote Access:</strong> If remote access is
required, replace direct RDP exposure with a secure solution such as a
Virtual Private Network (VPN) or a Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA)
gateway. All such solutions must be protected with MFA.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="medium-priority-actions-within-90-days">Medium-Priority Actions
(Within 90 Days)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Launch Security Awareness Training:</strong> Implement a
mandatory security awareness training program for all employees. This
program should be conducted upon hiring and at least annually
thereafter. It should cover topics like phishing, password hygiene, and
acceptable use.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Vulnerability Scanning:</strong> Establish a
regular vulnerability scanning program for all external and internal
assets to proactively identify and remediate security
weaknesses.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The current security posture of is precarious and requires immediate
attention. The combination of an exposed RDP server, a lack of
multi-factor authentication, and an untrained workforce presents a clear
and present danger to the organization’s data, operations, and
reputation.</p>
<p>By implementing the prioritized recommendations in this report, can
significantly reduce its attack surface and build a more resilient and
defensible security foundation.</p>
