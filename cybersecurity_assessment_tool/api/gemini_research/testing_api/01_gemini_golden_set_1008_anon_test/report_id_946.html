<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity assessment
conducted for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The assessment
combined a review of organizational security controls, an external
network vulnerability scan, and an analysis of pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The overall security posture presents a mixed landscape. On a
positive note, the external network scan of the target host
<code>[Target IP]</code> revealed no open ports, suggesting a
well-configured network perimeter. The organization also enforces
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and conducts annual
security training, which are commendable baseline practices.</p>
<p>However, several critical and high-risk gaps were identified in the
organization’s security controls. The absence of MFA for computer logins
and access to sensitive data systems constitutes a significant
vulnerability. An attacker who compromises a user’s credentials could
gain direct access to endpoints and critical information. Furthermore,
the lack of mandatory security awareness training for new employees
leaves a crucial window of vulnerability, as new hires are often
targeted by social engineering attacks.</p>
<p>This report provides a detailed breakdown of these findings and
offers actionable recommendations to mitigate the identified risks and
strengthen the organization’s overall defense-in-depth strategy.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-control-gaps">Analysis of Control
Gaps</h2>
<p>The review identified three primary areas of concern:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Endpoint Access Control:</strong> The lack of MFA for
computer logins significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access
following a credential compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sensitive Data Protection:</strong> Failure to protect
sensitive data systems with MFA removes a critical layer of defense for
the organization’s most valuable information assets.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Employee Onboarding:</strong> New employees are not
receiving security awareness training upon being hired. This group is
often highly susceptible to phishing and social engineering attacks,
creating an immediate risk to the organization.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed to identify open ports,
running services, and potential vulnerabilities on the public-facing
infrastructure.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> [Scan Date]</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="findings">Findings</h2>
<p>The scan of the target system completed successfully. <strong>No open
ports or active services were discovered.</strong></p>
<p>This is a positive security finding, indicating that the network
firewall and perimeter security controls are effectively configured to
deny unsolicited inbound traffic. This greatly reduces the external
attack surface of the scanned host.</p>
<h1 id="consolidated-risk-assessment">Consolidated Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section correlates findings from the security control review,
technical scan, and any pre-existing risks. No pre-existing risks were
provided for this assessment. The primary risks identified stem from
gaps in administrative and identity management controls.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified
risks and improve the overall security posture of <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong>. Recommendations are prioritized based on risk
severity.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="critical-priority">Critical Priority</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for All Sensitive Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Enforce a non-bypassable MFA policy for
all user accounts (including administrative and service accounts) that
can access systems designated as containing sensitive or critical
data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Drastically reduces the risk of a data
breach resulting from stolen credentials.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="high-priority">High Priority</h2>
<ol start="2">
<li><p><strong>Deploy MFA for Endpoint Logon:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Integrate an MFA solution (e.g., Windows
Hello for Business, Duo, etc.) for all Windows, macOS, and Linux
endpoint logins.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Protects against unauthorized physical
and remote access to user workstations, preventing an attacker’s initial
foothold from becoming a network-wide compromise.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Mandate Security Training During Onboarding:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop or procure a security awareness
training module and integrate it into the mandatory onboarding checklist
for all new hires, to be completed within their first week of
employment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Equips new employees with the knowledge
to recognize and report security threats from day one, reducing the
organization’s susceptibility to social engineering.</p></li>
