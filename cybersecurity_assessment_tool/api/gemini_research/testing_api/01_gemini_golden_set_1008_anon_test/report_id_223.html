<p><strong>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</strong> Prepared for:<br />
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong> <strong>Date:</strong>

<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity assessment for
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on an analysis of network
scan data, organizational security controls, and pre-existing risk
documentation. The assessment was conducted to identify key
vulnerabilities and provide actionable recommendations to enhance the
organization’s security posture.</p>
<p>The analysis revealed several critical and high-risk gaps in the
current security framework. Key findings include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Critical Gap in Access Control:</strong> Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) is not enforced for accessing sensitive data
systems. This represents a significant vulnerability, as a single
compromised credential could lead to a major data breach.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>High-Risk Policy Deficiencies:</strong> The organization
lacks a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy and does not provide
mandatory annual security awareness training for all staff. These gaps
increase the likelihood of human error leading to security
incidents.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Exposed Management Service:</strong> The external network
scan identified an open SSH port (22), which is a common target for
automated brute-force attacks.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The overall security posture requires immediate attention. The
recommendations outlined in this report are designed to address these
findings systematically, starting with the most critical
vulnerabilities. We strongly advise prioritizing the implementation of
MFA on all sensitive systems and developing foundational security
policies and training programs.</p>

questionnaire. The responses highlight significant gaps in policy and
access control measures. A "No" response indicates a deviation from
security best practices and a potential risk.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-control-gaps">Analysis of Control Gaps</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA on Sensitive Systems:</strong> The absence of MFA on
systems containing sensitive data is a critical vulnerability. It
significantly lowers the barrier for an attacker to access crown jewel
assets after compromising a user’s credentials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> Without a formal
AUP, there are no established rules for employees regarding the use of
company assets. This can lead to unintentional misuse, data leakage, and
a weakened legal position in the event of an insider incident.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Annual Security Training:</strong> While training new
hires is a good start, the threat landscape evolves continuously. A lack
of annual refresher training for all employees means that their ability
to recognize and respond to modern threats, such as sophisticated
phishing attacks, diminishes over time.</p></li>

<h2 id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of Technical
Findings</h2>
<p>The presence of an open SSH port (22) indicates that a remote
management service is exposed to the public internet. While necessary
for administration, SSH is a primary target for automated brute-force
and credential-stuffing attacks. Without information on the version or
configuration, it is not possible to determine if it is vulnerable to
specific exploits, but its exposure alone constitutes a security risk.
Best practices dictate that access to such management ports should be
strictly controlled.</p>

<p>The following table synthesizes findings from the security control
review and the technical scan. No pre-existing vulnerabilities were
documented in the provided data. Each risk has been assigned a severity
level to aid in prioritization.</p>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified
risks and improve the overall security posture of <strong>[Organization

<h2 id="immediate-actions-1-30-days">Immediate Actions (1-30 Days)</h2>
<dl>
<dt>For RISK-001 (Critical):</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>Implement MFA on Sensitive Systems.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Immediately deploy and enforce MFA for all user accounts
(including administrative and service accounts) that have access to
systems storing or processing sensitive data.</p></li>
<li><p>Prioritize systems containing financial records, customer PII, or
intellectual property.</p></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>For RISK-004 (Medium):</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>Restrict SSH Access.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement a firewall rule to restrict access to Port 22 to only
known, trusted IP addresses (e.g., corporate offices, administrator
locations).</p></li>
<li><p>If remote access from dynamic IPs is required, implement a
Virtual Private Network (VPN) and place the SSH service behind
it.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure SSH is configured to disallow root login and
password-based authentication, enforcing the use of strong cryptographic
keys instead.</p></li>

Days)</h2>
<dl>
<dt>For RISK-002 (High):</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP).</strong></p>

company networks, devices, and data.</p></li>
<li><p>Communicate the policy to all employees and require them to
formally acknowledge their understanding and agreement.</p></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>For RISK-003 (High):</dt>
<dd>

<li><p>Supplement annual training with periodic phishing simulations to
measure effectiveness.</p></li>
