<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity assessment for
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on a network scan, a review
of administrative security controls, and an analysis of pre-existing
risks.</p>
<p>The assessment reveals a mixed security posture. The organization
demonstrates strong foundational security in its identity and access
management, with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) widely implemented
across key systems. The external network scan of
<code>[Client IP]</code> did not reveal any open, vulnerable ports;
specifically, a previously identified risk concerning an open Port 80
appears to have been remediated as the port was found to be closed.</p>
<p>However, a critical gap was identified in the employee onboarding
process. The lack of mandatory security awareness training for new
employees represents a significant administrative vulnerability. This
gap exposes the organization to a heightened risk of social engineering
attacks, such as phishing, and unintentional policy violations.</p>
<p>Our primary recommendation is to immediately implement a mandatory
security awareness training module into the new employee onboarding
process. This will ensure that all personnel are equipped with the
fundamental knowledge required to protect organizational assets from day
one.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>The organization has effectively implemented MFA across critical
access points, which significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
access via compromised credentials. However, the lack of security
awareness training for new employees (<strong>marked in red</strong>) is
a critical deficiency. New hires are often prime targets for social
engineering attacks, and without initial training, they are more likely
to fall victim to phishing, mishandle sensitive data, or violate
acceptable use policies unknowingly. This gap undermines the
effectiveness of other security controls.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>

<p>The scan confirmed that port 80 (HTTP) is <strong>closed</strong> to
external traffic. This is a strong security practice, as it prevents
unencrypted web communication. This finding directly contradicts a
pre-existing risk entry (see Section 5), suggesting that the risk has
been successfully remediated or was a false positive in a previous
assessment. No other open ports were discovered during this scan.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis, we provide the following prioritized
recommendations to enhance the cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="priority-1-implement-onboarding-security-training-high">Priority 1:
Implement Onboarding Security Training (High)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop and integrate a mandatory
security awareness training module into the formal onboarding process
for all new employees and contractors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Details:</strong> The training should cover, at a
minimum:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Phishing and social engineering awareness.</p></li>
<li><p>The organization’s acceptable use policy.</p></li>
<li><p>Best practices for password management and MFA.</p></li>
<li><p>Procedures for reporting security incidents.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> This will significantly reduce the risk
of human error, which is a leading cause of security breaches, and
ensure a consistent security baseline across the entire
organization.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="priority-2-update-risk-register-informational">Priority 2: Update
Risk Register (Informational)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Formally validate that the risk
associated with the "Unencrypted Web Server" on Port 80 has been
remediated.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Details:</strong> Based on our scan, Port 80 is closed.
We recommend internal verification and updating the organization’s risk
register to mark this vulnerability as "Remediated" or
"Closed".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Ensures the risk register is accurate
and reflects the current security posture, allowing resources to be
focused on active threats.</p></li>
