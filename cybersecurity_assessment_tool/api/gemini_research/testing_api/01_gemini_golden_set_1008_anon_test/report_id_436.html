<p><strong>Cybersecurity Posture Assessment Report</strong> Prepared
for:<br />
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong> <strong>Analysis Conducted
By:</strong><br />

<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment conducted for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The
assessment combined an external network scan, a review of existing
risks, and an analysis of organizational security controls based on a
provided questionnaire.</p>
<p>The overall security posture presents a mixed landscape. On a
positive note, the external network scan of the target asset at
<code>[Target IP]</code> revealed no open ports, suggesting a robust and
well-configured perimeter firewall. This significantly reduces the
external attack surface.</p>
<p>However, the review of organizational security controls identified
two critical gaps that introduce substantial risk:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
Email:</strong> This is a critical vulnerability, as email is a primary
target for attackers. Without MFA, user accounts are susceptible to
compromise via phishing, credential stuffing, and other common attacks,
which could lead to a significant data breach.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> This policy gap creates ambiguity regarding the proper
use of company assets, increasing the risk of insider threats,
unintentional data leakage, and non-compliance with potential regulatory
requirements.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>No pre-existing vulnerabilities were reported. The immediate priority
should be to address the identified policy and access control
deficiencies to mitigate the high-impact risks they represent.
Recommendations for remediation are detailed in Section <a
href="#sec:recommendations" data-reference-type="ref"

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network vulnerability scan was performed using Nmap
against the designated target IP address.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Target IP:</dt>
<dd>
<p><code>[Target IP]</code></p>
</dd>
<dt>Scan Date:</dt>

</dd>
<dt>Host Status:</dt>
<dd>
<p>Up</p>
</dd>
<dt>Summary:</dt>
<dd>
<p>The scan confirmed that the target host is online and responsive.
However, no open TCP ports were discovered within the top 1000 scanned
ports. All ports reported a ’closed’ state.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Conclusion:</dt>
<dd>
<p>This result is a strong indicator of a properly configured firewall
that denies unsolicited inbound traffic. The organization’s external
network perimeter appears secure from common, opportunistic attacks.</p>

<h1 id="sec:recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actionable recommendations are provided to address the
identified risks and improve the overall security posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="risk-001-implement-mfa-for-email-access-critical">RISK-001:
Implement MFA for Email Access (Critical)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Action:</strong> Enforce mandatory MFA for all
user accounts accessing the corporate email system (e.g., Microsoft 365,
Google Workspace). This should apply to all access methods, including
webmail, desktop clients, and mobile devices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Select an MFA method that
balances security and user convenience, such as authenticator apps
(preferred) or SMS-based codes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>User Training:</strong> Communicate the change to all
employees, provide clear instructions on how to set up MFA, and explain
its importance in protecting their accounts and company data.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="risk-002-develop-and-implement-an-aup-high">RISK-002: Develop
and Implement an AUP (High)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Action:</strong> Draft a formal Acceptable Use
Policy that clearly defines the rules and responsibilities for all
employees when using company-owned IT assets.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Policy Content:</strong> The AUP should cover, at a
minimum: data handling procedures, internet usage restrictions, use of
personal devices (BYOD), software installation rules, and consequences
for non-compliance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Deployment:</strong> The policy should be reviewed by
management and legal counsel before being distributed to all current
employees for review and acknowledgment. This process must be integrated
into the onboarding procedure for all new hires.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The assessment for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong> reveals a
security posture with notable strengths and critical weaknesses. The
secure configuration of the external network perimeter is commendable
and provides a solid first line of defense.</p>
<p>However, the internal policy and identity management controls require
immediate attention. The absence of MFA on a critical service like email
and the lack of a foundational Acceptable Use Policy expose the
organization to severe risks that could undermine its technical
defenses.</p>
<p>By implementing the recommendations outlined in this report,
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong> can significantly reduce its risk
exposure and build a more resilient and mature cybersecurity
program.</p>
