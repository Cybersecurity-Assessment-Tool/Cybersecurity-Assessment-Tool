\section{Executive Summary}
% ==============================================================================

This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture assessment conducted for \orgname. The analysis is based on a combination of network scanning, a review of existing risk documentation, and an evaluation of organizational security controls via a questionnaire.

The assessment identified several critical and high-severity risks that require immediate attention. The most significant findings include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Publicly Exposed Database Service:} A MySQL database server was found to be directly accessible from the internet. The running version, MySQL 5.7.33, is officially End-of-Life (EOL) and no longer receives security updates, posing a severe risk of exploitation.
    \item \textbf{Critical Gaps in Access Control:} Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not enforced for accessing email or other sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise and unauthorized data access.
    \item \textbf{Insufficient Security Training:} The lack of a recurring, annual security awareness training program for all employees leaves the organization more susceptible to social engineering and phishing attacks.
\end{itemize}

The combination of an exposed, outdated database and weak access controls creates a synergistic risk profile that could be exploited by malicious actors. This report provides a detailed breakdown of these findings and offers prioritized, actionable recommendations to mitigate the identified risks and improve the overall security posture of \orgname.

% ==============================================================================
\section{Organizational Information}
% ==============================================================================

The following information was used as the basis for this assessment. Where data was not provided, placeholders have been used.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Organization Name:} \orgname
    \item \textbf{Primary Email Domain:} \clientdomain
    \item \textbf{External IP Address Scanned:} \clientip
\end{itemize}

\section{Security Control Review}
% ==============================================================================

The following table summarizes the organization's responses to the security controls questionnaire. "No" answers indicate significant gaps in the security framework and are highlighted as areas for improvement.

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\caption{Security Controls Questionnaire Analysis}
\begin{tabular}{p{0.6\linewidth} c p{0.25\linewidth}}
\toprule
\textbf{Control Question} & \textbf{Response} & \textbf{Assessment} \\
\midrule
Do you require MFA to access email? & \no & \textbf{Critical Gap.} Email is a primary target for account takeover. \\
\addlinespace
Do you require MFA to log into computers? & \yes & Foundational control is in place. \\
\addlinespace
Do you require MFA to access sensitive data systems? & \no & \textbf{Critical Gap.} Direct risk to sensitive information. \\
\addlinespace
Does your organization have an employee acceptable use policy? & \yes & Foundational policy is in place. \\
\addlinespace
Does your organization do security awareness training for new employees? & \yes & Good practice for onboarding. \\
\addlinespace
Does your organization do security awareness training for all employees at least once per year? & \no & \textbf{High Risk.} Lack of ongoing training increases susceptibility to phishing. \\

\section{Technical Scan Results}
% ==============================================================================

An external network scan was performed against the target IP address \targetip. The scan identified the following open port and running service.

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\caption{Nmap Scan Findings for Target: \targetip}
\begin{tabular}{c c l l p{0.3\linewidth}}
\toprule
\textbf{Port} & \textbf{State} & \textbf{Service} & \textbf{Product \& Version} & \textbf{Notes} \\
\midrule
3306/tcp & open & mysql & MySQL 5.7.33 & \textbf{Critical:} This version is \textbf{End-of-Life (EOL)} as of October 2023 and is no longer receiving security updates. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Analysis of Technical Findings}
The presence of an open MySQL port (3306) is a significant security risk. It allows attackers to directly interact with the database from anywhere on the internet, enabling brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, and exploitation of known vulnerabilities.

Compounding this risk is the fact that the detected version, \textbf{MySQL 5.7.33}, is outdated and unsupported. Any vulnerabilities discovered after its EOL date in October 2023 will not be patched by the vendor, leaving the system permanently vulnerable.


% ==============================================================================
\section{Correlated Risk Assessment}
% ==============================================================================

This section synthesizes findings from the security control review, technical scan, and pre-existing risk data to provide a holistic view of the current risk posture.

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\caption{Summary of Identified Risks}
\begin{tabular}{p{0.25\linewidth} p{0.5\linewidth} c}
\toprule
\textbf{Risk Title} & \textbf{Description} & \textbf{Severity} \\
\midrule
\textbf{Exposed End-of-Life Database} & The MySQL database on port 3306 is open to the internet and is running an unsupported, EOL version (5.7.33). This directly confirms the pre-existing "Database Exposure" risk. & \textbf{Critical (7.5)} \\
\addlinespace
\textbf{Insufficient MFA Coverage} & Lack of MFA on email and sensitive data systems exposes the organization to account takeover, data breaches, and ransomware, especially when combined with the exposed database. & \textbf{Critical} \\
\addlinespace
\textbf{Inadequate Security Awareness Program} & The absence of annual security training for all staff increases the likelihood of a successful phishing attack, which could lead to credential compromise and exploitation of other weaknesses. & \textbf{High} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

% ==============================================================================
\section{Recommendations}
% ==============================================================================

The following prioritized recommendations are provided to address the identified risks.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{IMMEDIATE: Restrict Database Access.}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Action:} Implement strict firewall rules to block all public access to TCP port 3306. Access should only be permitted from trusted internal IP addresses or via a secure VPN.
        \item \textbf{Justification:} This is the fastest way to mitigate the immediate threat of external attack against the exposed database service.
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{0.5cm}

    \item \textbf{HIGH PRIORITY: Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication.}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Action:} Procure and deploy an MFA solution for all user accounts, prioritizing email (e.g., Office 365, Google Workspace) and any systems identified as containing sensitive data.
        \item \textbf{Justification:} MFA is one of the most effective controls for preventing account compromise, even if user credentials are stolen.
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{0.5cm}
    
    \item \textbf{HIGH PRIORITY: Upgrade Outdated Database Software.}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Action:} Develop a plan to migrate the MySQL 5.7 database to a currently supported version (e.g., MySQL 8.x). This involves testing, data backup, and a scheduled migration.
        \item \textbf{Justification:} Running EOL software is unsustainable and guarantees future vulnerability. Upgrading ensures the system receives critical security patches.
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{0.5cm}

    \item \textbf{MEDIUM PRIORITY: Establish Annual Security Training.}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Action:} Implement a mandatory security awareness training program for all employees to be completed annually. The training should cover topics such as phishing, password hygiene, and acceptable use.
        \item \textbf{Justification:} A well-informed workforce is a critical layer of defense against social engineering attacks, reducing the "human factor" risk.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
