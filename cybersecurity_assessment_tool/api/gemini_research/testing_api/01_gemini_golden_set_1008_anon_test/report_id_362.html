<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity assessment
conducted for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The analysis is
based on a synthesis of network scan data, a security controls
questionnaire, and a review of pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The assessment revealed several critical and high-severity risks that
require immediate attention. Key findings include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Critical FTP Vulnerability:</strong> An externally facing
FTP server on <code>[Client IP]</code> is running a dangerously outdated
version of <code>vsftpd</code> (2.3.4), which is known to contain a
critical backdoor vulnerability (CVE-2011-2523). Furthermore, the server
is misconfigured to allow anonymous logins, significantly increasing the
risk of unauthorized access and data compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Critical Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA):</strong> MFA is not enforced for accessing email or other
sensitive data systems. This represents a major security gap, leaving
critical assets vulnerable to compromise via stolen
credentials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>High Risk from Inadequate Training:</strong> The
organization does not conduct mandatory annual security awareness
training for all employees. This oversight cultivates a high-risk
environment where employees are more susceptible to phishing and social
engineering attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pre-existing Medium Risk:</strong> The organization is
aware of an existing risk related to outdated Windows 7 workstations,
which are no longer supported and do not receive security
updates.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The combination of these findings indicates a weak security posture.
Immediate and decisive action is required to remediate these
vulnerabilities and mitigate the substantial risk of a security breach.
This report provides specific, actionable recommendations to address
each identified issue.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following details were used as the basis for this assessment.
Where information was not provided, placeholders have been used.</p>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>The following table summarizes the organization’s self-reported
security controls based on the provided questionnaire. A green checkmark
() indicates a positive control is in place, while a red cross ()
indicates a control gap.</p>
<div class="tabular">
<p><span>L<span>0.75</span> c</span> <strong>Control Question</strong>

Do you require MFA to access email? &amp;<br />
Do you require MFA to log into computers? &amp;<br />

&amp;<br />
Does your organization do security awareness training for all employees

</p>
</div>
<p>The identified gaps in MFA enforcement for email and sensitive
systems, along with the lack of recurring security training, are
significant contributors to the overall risk profile.</p>

<p>The scan identified one open port, which presents a critical security
risk:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 21 (FTP):</strong> The FTP service is running
<strong>vsftpd version 2.3.4</strong>. This specific version is widely
known to be vulnerable to a critical backdoor vulnerability
(<strong>CVE-2011-2523</strong>). An attacker can exploit this flaw to
gain a command shell on the underlying server, leading to a full system
compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Anonymous FTP Enabled:</strong> The scan confirmed that
<strong>anonymous FTP login is allowed</strong>. This misconfiguration
permits anyone on the internet to connect to the server and potentially
access, upload, or download files, creating a high risk of data leakage
or malware distribution.</p></li>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified
risks. They are prioritized by severity.</p>
<h2 id="immediate-actions-critical-risks">Immediate Actions (Critical
Risks)</h2>
<h3 id="remediate-vulnerable-ftp-server">Remediate Vulnerable FTP
Server</h3>
<p>The exposed FTP server represents an immediate and severe threat.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Decommission:</strong> If the FTP service is not
essential for business operations, shut it down and block port 21 at the
firewall immediately.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade &amp; Secure:</strong> If the service is
required, take the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Upgrade <code>vsftpd</code> to the latest stable version to patch
the backdoor vulnerability.</p></li>
<li><p>Disable anonymous FTP access in the configuration file.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement strong user passwords and enforce access
controls.</p></li>
<li><p>Place the server behind a firewall and restrict access to only
known, trusted IP addresses.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="enforce-multi-factor-authentication-mfa">Enforce Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA)</h3>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Prioritize Email:</strong> Immediately enforce MFA for
all user access to the email system (e.g., Office 365, Google
Workspace). This is the most common vector for account
takeovers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sensitive Systems:</strong> Develop a plan to roll out
MFA for all systems identified as containing sensitive data within the
next 30 days.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="high-priority-actions">High-Priority Actions</h2>
<h3 id="implement-annual-security-awareness-training">Implement Annual
Security Awareness Training</h3>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Establish a Program:</strong> Procure and implement a
security awareness training solution.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mandate Participation:</strong> Make annual training
mandatory for all employees, including management.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Track Completion:</strong> Track completion rates to
ensure 100% participation. The training should cover key topics such as
phishing, password hygiene, and acceptable use.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="medium-priority-actions">Medium-Priority Actions</h2>
<h3 id="address-outdated-windows-policy">Address Outdated Windows
Policy</h3>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Execute Upgrade Plan:</strong> Continue with the existing
recommendation to upgrade all Windows 7 workstations to a modern,
supported operating system like Windows 10 or 11.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Isolate Legacy Systems:</strong> If certain systems
cannot be upgraded due to hardware or software constraints, they should
be isolated on a separate network segment with restricted access to
prevent them from being used as a pivot point in an attack.</p></li>
