<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity assessment for
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The analysis is based on a
correlation of external network scans, a review of internal security
controls via a questionnaire, and an evaluation of previously identified
risks.</p>
<p>The assessment has identified a <strong>critical-risk
vulnerability</strong> that requires immediate attention. An external
scan confirmed that a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) service is directly
exposed to the public internet on the primary external IP address
<code>[Client IP]</code>. This technical vulnerability is severely
compounded by an organizational policy gap: the lack of mandatory
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This combination
creates a high-impact, high-likelihood scenario for a network breach via
credential theft or brute-force attacks.</p>
<p>Furthermore, significant gaps were identified in foundational
security governance, including the absence of an employee acceptable use
policy and a lack of recurring, annual security awareness training.
These deficiencies increase the organization’s overall susceptibility to
a wide range of cyber threats, particularly social engineering and
phishing attacks.</p>
<p>Immediate remediation of the exposed RDP service is paramount.
Subsequently, the organization must prioritize the implementation of
mandatory MFA and the development of core security policies and training
programs to build a more resilient security posture.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-control-gaps">Analysis of Control Gaps</h2>
<p>The questionnaire reveals three critical areas of concern:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>No MFA for Computer Logins:</strong> This is a critical
weakness. Without MFA, a compromised password is all an attacker needs
to gain direct access to an employee’s workstation and, potentially, the
entire network. This gap directly elevates the risk associated with the
exposed RDP service found in the technical scan.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> An AUP is a
foundational governance document that sets clear expectations for
employee behavior regarding company assets and data. Its absence leads
to inconsistent security practices and a lack of enforceable
consequences for policy violations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Annual Security Awareness Training:</strong> While
training for new hires is in place, the lack of a recurring annual
program for all employees is a major oversight. The threat landscape
evolves constantly, and so do tactics used by attackers. Regular
training is essential to keep security top-of-mind and to educate staff
on new threats like advanced phishing techniques.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>

<h2 id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of Technical
Findings</h2>
<p>The scan confirms that the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) service is
directly accessible from the public internet. RDP is a frequent target
for attackers who use brute-force password guessing, credential
stuffing, and exploitation of known vulnerabilities (e.g., BlueKeep) to
gain unauthorized access to internal networks. Exposing this service
without mitigating controls like a VPN or strict IP whitelisting is a
critical security misconfiguration.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified
risks and improve the overall security posture of <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="immediate-priority-remediate-within-24-48-hours">Immediate
Priority (Remediate within 24-48 hours)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Close Port 3389 on the External Firewall:</strong>
Immediately implement a firewall rule to <strong>block all inbound
traffic</strong> to TCP port 3389 on the external IP address
<code>[Client IP]</code>. This will eliminate the direct
exposure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Review for Active Compromise:</strong> Investigate system
logs for the host associated with <code>[Target IP]</code> for any signs
of unauthorized or suspicious login activity.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="high-priority-remediate-within-30-days">High Priority (Remediate
within 30 days)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement a Secure Remote Access Solution:</strong> For
necessary remote access, deploy a Virtual Private Network (VPN)
solution. Access to the RDP service should only be possible after a user
has successfully authenticated to the VPN, which must be configured to
require Multi-Factor Authentication.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enforce MFA for All Computer Logins:</strong> Procure and
deploy an MFA solution for all workstation and server logins. This is a
critical compensating control that protects against password
compromise.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="medium-priority-remediate-within-90-days">Medium Priority
(Remediate within 90 days)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a formal AUP document that all employees must
read and acknowledge. This policy should define the rules for using
company networks, systems, and data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish an Annual Security Awareness Training
Program:</strong> Implement a mandatory security awareness training
program for all employees to be completed annually. The training should
cover current threats such as phishing, ransomware, and proper data
handling.</p></li>
