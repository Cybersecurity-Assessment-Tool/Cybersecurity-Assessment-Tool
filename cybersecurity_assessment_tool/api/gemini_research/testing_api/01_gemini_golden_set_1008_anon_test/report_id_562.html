<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive assessment of the cybersecurity
posture for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The analysis is based
on a combination of a self-reported security controls questionnaire, a
technical network scan of the external perimeter, and a review of
pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The assessment identified two significant areas of concern requiring
immediate attention. The most critical finding is the absence of
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems.
This gap exposes the organization’s most valuable assets to significant
risk from credential theft and unauthorized access.</p>
<p>Additionally, the lack of a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP) represents a high-risk governance gap. Without a defined AUP, the
organization cannot enforce secure employee behavior or establish a
baseline for acceptable use of company resources, increasing the
likelihood of insider threats and unintentional data breaches.</p>
<p>The technical network scan performed against the designated target IP
address (<code>[Target IP]</code>) did not yield any open ports. While
this can indicate a strong firewall configuration, it also limits our
ability to assess vulnerabilities on externally-facing services.</p>
<p>This report details these findings and provides actionable
recommendations to mitigate the identified risks and strengthen the
overall security posture of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following information was used as the basis for this assessment.
As per our analysis protocol, certain identifying details have been

(Questionnaire)</h1>
<p>The following table summarizes the organization’s responses to the
security controls questionnaire. A green checkmark () indicates a
positive control is in place, while a red ’X’ () highlights a control
gap that introduces risk.</p>

<strong>Control Question</strong> &amp; <strong>Response</strong><br />
Do you require MFA to access email? &amp;<br />
Do you require MFA to log into computers? &amp;<br />
Do you require MFA to access sensitive data systems? &amp;<br />
Does your organization have an employee acceptable use policy?
&amp;<br />
Does your organization do security awareness training for new employees?
&amp;<br />
Does your organization do security awareness training for all employees
at least once per year? &amp;<br />
</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The questionnaire reveals a strong
implementation of MFA for email and computer access, which is
commendable. However, the two identified gaps are significant and are
detailed further in the Risk Assessment section of this report.</p>

<h2 id="scan-findings">Scan Findings</h2>
<p>The network scan did not identify any open TCP or UDP ports on the
target host.</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Stealth Configuration:</strong> This result may indicate
a robust firewall configuration that is correctly blocking all
unsolicited inbound traffic, which is a positive security
practice.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Host Unresponsive:</strong> Alternatively, the target
host may have been offline or unreachable at the time of the
scan.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Services:</strong> It is also possible that no network
services are hosted at this specific IP address.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Due to the lack of discovered services, no technical vulnerabilities
could be identified from this scan. Further internal testing is
recommended to assess the security of internal systems.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes findings from the security control review

<strong>ID</strong> &amp; <strong>Risk Name</strong> &amp;
<strong>Description</strong> &amp; <strong>Severity</strong><br />
RISK-001 &amp; Lack of MFA for Sensitive Systems &amp; The absence of
Multi-Factor Authentication on systems containing sensitive or critical
data. A compromised password would be sufficient for an attacker to gain
direct access to high-value assets, potentially leading to a major data
breach. &amp; <strong>Critical</strong><br />
RISK-002 &amp; No Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) &amp; The
organization lacks a formal policy defining the rules and guidelines for
the use of its networks, systems, and data. This leads to inconsistent
security practices and a lack of legal and administrative recourse in
cases of misuse or negligence. &amp; <strong>High</strong><br />

<strong>For Risk</strong> &amp; <strong>Recommendation</strong><br />
RISK-001 &amp; <strong>Implement MFA on All Sensitive
Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Prioritize the immediate deployment of a robust MFA solution for
all user accounts (including administrative and service accounts) that
can access sensitive data repositories, databases, and critical
applications.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure the policy is enforced and cannot be bypassed by
users.</p></li>
<li><p>This action is the single most effective control to prevent
unauthorized access resulting from credential compromise.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><br />
RISK-002 &amp; <strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use
Policy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Draft a comprehensive AUP that clearly outlines the rules for
employee use of company technology, including email, internet, software,
and data handling.</p></li>
<li><p>Require all current and new employees to read and formally
acknowledge the policy.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct regular training to ensure the policy is understood and
followed. This policy will form the foundation of the organization’s
security culture.</p></li>
