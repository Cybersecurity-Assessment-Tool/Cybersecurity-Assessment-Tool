<p><strong>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</strong> <strong>Prepared

</div>
<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a cybersecurity assessment for
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on data provided for
analysis. The evaluation primarily focused on organizational security
controls derived from a questionnaire, as the technical network scan
data and pre-existing risk logs were found to be corrupted and could not
be processed.</p>
<p>The analysis of the security questionnaire revealed several
<strong>critical gaps</strong> in foundational security controls. The
most severe findings include the absence of mandatory Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for email and computer access. These gaps expose
the organization to significant risks, including business email
compromise, ransomware attacks, and unauthorized data access.</p>
<p>Furthermore, key governance and training policies are missing, such
as a formal employee acceptable use policy and mandatory security
training for new hires. These deficiencies weaken the organization’s
overall security posture by increasing the likelihood of human error and
insider threats.</p>
<p>This report outlines the identified risks and provides prioritized,
actionable recommendations to mitigate them. Immediate focus should be
placed on implementing MFA across all critical systems and establishing
formal security policies and training programs. A comprehensive
technical vulnerability scan is also strongly recommended once system
access is available.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following details were used as the basis for this assessment. As
the provided organizational data was incomplete, placeholders have been
used where necessary.</p>

<h1 id="security-control-review-questionnaire-analysis">Security Control
Review (Questionnaire Analysis)</h1>
<p>An analysis of the organization’s security questionnaire was
performed to evaluate the implementation of key administrative and
technical controls. The results are summarized in the table below. "No"
answers indicate significant control gaps that increase organizational
risk.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-control-gaps">Analysis of Control
Gaps</h2>
<p>The questionnaire reveals critical weaknesses in access control and
security governance:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA:</strong> The absence of MFA for email and
computer logins is a severe vulnerability. Stolen credentials alone are
sufficient for an attacker to gain access, leading to potential data
breaches and financial loss.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Missing Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> Without a
formal AUP, employees lack clear guidelines on the acceptable use of
company assets, data handling, and security responsibilities. This
creates legal and operational risks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Onboarding Training:</strong> New employees are a
prime target for social engineering attacks. Failing to provide security
training during onboarding leaves a critical window of vulnerability
before they are integrated into the annual training cycle.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>The provided network scan data file
(<code>Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON</code>) was found to be corrupted or
incomplete. As a result, a technical analysis of open ports, running
services, and potential vulnerabilities on the target host
<code>[Target IP]</code> could not be performed.</p>
<p>A full external and internal network vulnerability scan is essential
for a comprehensive security assessment. It is strongly recommended that
a new scan be conducted to identify technical vulnerabilities that this
policy-based review could not uncover.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This risk assessment is based on the findings from the Security
Control Review. The pre-existing risk data
(<code>Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON</code>) was also unavailable for
analysis. The following risks have been identified and prioritized based
on their potential impact on the organization.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following prioritized recommendations are provided to address the
identified risks and strengthen the overall security posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
(Critical):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediately deploy and enforce MFA for
all users across all critical systems, prioritizing email (e.g., Office
365, Google Workspace) and endpoint logins (e.g., Windows Hello,
Duo).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> This is the single most effective
control to mitigate the risks of credential theft (RISK-001,
RISK-002).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)
(High):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Draft a formal AUP that clearly defines
the rules for using company networks, devices, and data. This policy
should be reviewed by legal counsel, communicated to all employees, and
require a signed acknowledgment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> An AUP establishes a clear
security baseline for all employees and provides an enforcement
framework, mitigating governance risks (RISK-003).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Integrate Security into Employee Onboarding
(High):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Create a mandatory security awareness
training module for all new employees to be completed within their first
week of employment. This should cover the AUP, phishing identification,
password hygiene, and incident reporting.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> This closes a critical
vulnerability window for new hires and ensures they are aware of their
security responsibilities from day one (RISK-004).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct a Comprehensive Technical Security Scan
(Urgent):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Commission a new, authenticated external
and internal vulnerability scan of the organization’s network
infrastructure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> The current assessment lacks
technical findings. A new scan is crucial to identify and remediate
software vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and other technical risks
that are currently unknown.</p></li>
