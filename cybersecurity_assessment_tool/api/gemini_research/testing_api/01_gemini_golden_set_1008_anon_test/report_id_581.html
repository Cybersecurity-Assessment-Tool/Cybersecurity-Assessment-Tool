<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity assessment
conducted for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The assessment
combined an external network scan, a review of existing risk
documentation, and an analysis of organizational security controls
provided via a questionnaire.</p>
<p>The assessment identified a <strong>critical risk</strong> related to
the direct exposure of Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) on the public
internet at . This configuration is a primary target for ransomware
gangs and other malicious actors who use it for initial access into
corporate networks.</p>
<p>This critical technical vulnerability is further compounded by a
significant gap in internal security controls: the absence of
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This combination
creates a high-impact scenario where a single compromised password could
lead to an attacker gaining full remote control of an internal system,
bypassing other security measures.</p>
<p>While the organization has implemented several positive security
controls, such as MFA for email and a security awareness training
program, the identified critical findings require immediate attention to
mitigate the substantial risk of a security breach. This report provides
prioritized, actionable recommendations to address these
vulnerabilities.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-findings">Analysis of
Findings</h2>
<p>The review shows that the organization has a solid foundation in
several key areas, including policy and security awareness. However, the
lack of MFA for computer logins is a critical weakness. This gap
significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access from compromised
credentials, nullifying many of the benefits of other security controls.
An attacker who obtains a valid username and password can log in to a
corporate machine without any secondary challenge.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-findings-1">Analysis of
Findings</h2>
<p>The scan confirms that TCP port 3389 is open, exposing the Remote
Desktop Protocol (RDP) service directly to the internet. RDP is a common
management protocol but is notoriously targeted by attackers for
brute-force password attacks, credential stuffing, and exploitation of
known vulnerabilities (e.g., BlueKeep). Exposing RDP is considered a
highly dangerous practice and is a leading cause of ransomware
incidents. This finding validates the pre-existing risk documented in
Input 3.</p>
<h1 id="correlated-risk-assessment">Correlated Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes the findings from the security control
review, the technical scan, and pre-existing risk data to provide a

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following recommendations are prioritized to address the most
critical risks identified during the assessment.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="priority-1-remediate-rdp-exposure-immediate">Priority 1: Remediate
RDP Exposure (Immediate)</h2>
<p>The exposed RDP service presents an immediate and severe threat and
must be addressed urgently.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Action:</strong> Implement a firewall rule to
<strong>block all inbound traffic</strong> to TCP port 3389 on the
external interface of your firewall for IP .</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Long-Term Solution:</strong> If remote access is a
business requirement, deploy a secure Virtual Private Network (VPN)
solution. Configure the VPN to require MFA for access. All RDP
connections should only be permitted through the secure VPN tunnel,
never directly from the internet.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="priority-2-implement-endpoint-mfa-high">Priority 2: Implement
Endpoint MFA (High)</h2>
<p>Addressing the lack of MFA on endpoints is crucial for a
defense-in-depth strategy and to protect against credential-based
attacks.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Deploy a mandatory MFA solution for all
user and administrator logins to both workstations and servers.
Solutions like Windows Hello for Business, Duo Security, or other
third-party tools can fulfill this requirement. This ensures that even
if an attacker obtains a password, they cannot access the system without
the second factor.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="positive-acknowledgement">Positive
Acknowledgement</h2>
<p>We commend <strong>[Organization Name]</strong> for implementing
important security controls, including MFA for email and sensitive
systems, and for maintaining a consistent security awareness training
program. These measures are vital for a strong security posture. By
addressing the critical recommendations in this report, the organization
can significantly reduce its risk profile.</p>
