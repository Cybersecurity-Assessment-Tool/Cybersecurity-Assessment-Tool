<p><strong>Cybersecurity Posture Report</strong> <strong>Prepared
for:</strong><br />
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Date of Report:</strong> 2026-01-30<br />
<strong>Report ID:</strong> CSR-2024-001</p>
<p><em>This report contains sensitive information regarding the security
posture of the organization. Distribution should be limited to
authorized personnel only.</em></p>
</div>
<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the cybersecurity
posture for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on a combination
of network scanning, a security controls questionnaire, and a review of
pre-existing risks. The assessment reveals several critical and
high-risk vulnerabilities that require immediate attention to mitigate
potential threats to the organization’s data and operations.</p>
<p>Key findings indicate a significant risk of data breach and
unauthorized access. An externally facing MySQL database was identified
running an End-of-Life (EOL) version, which no longer receives security
updates. This finding is compounded by critical gaps in internal
security controls, most notably the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) for computer logins and the absence of mandatory annual security
awareness training for all employees.</p>
<p>The overall security posture is assessed as <strong>High
Risk</strong>. This report outlines specific, actionable recommendations
to address these findings, strengthen security controls, and improve the
organization’s resilience against cyber threats.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following details were used as the basis for this assessment.
Anonymized data has been replaced with placeholders.</p>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A review of the organization’s security controls was conducted via a
questionnaire. The responses highlight key areas of strength and
weakness in the current security policies and their implementation. Gaps
identified here often represent significant organizational risk.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-gaps">Analysis of Gaps</h2>
<p>Two significant gaps were identified:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>No MFA for Computer Logins:</strong> This is a critical
vulnerability. Without MFA, user endpoints are susceptible to compromise
through weak, stolen, or brute-forced passwords, which can lead to
unauthorized access and lateral movement within the network.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Annual Security Awareness Training:</strong> The lack
of recurring training for all employees is a high-risk issue. The threat
landscape evolves continuously, and without regular training, staff are
more likely to fall victim to phishing, social engineering, and other
common attack vectors.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="technical-analysis">Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>The scan identified that port 3306 is open, exposing a MySQL database
service directly to the network. This configuration is highly
discouraged as it makes the database a direct target for attackers.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the detected version, <strong>MySQL 5.7.33</strong>, is
a critical concern. MySQL version 5.7 reached its official <strong>End
of Life (EOL) in October 2023</strong>. This means it no longer receives
security patches from the vendor, and any newly discovered
vulnerabilities will remain unpatched, leaving the system perpetually
vulnerable to exploitation. This finding confirms and elevates the
severity of the pre-existing risk "Database Exposure."</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actionable recommendations are provided to address the
identified risks. They are categorized by priority to guide remediation
efforts.</p>
<h2 id="critical-risk-exposed-end-of-life-database">Critical Risk:
Exposed End-of-Life Database</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Action (Containment):</strong> Implement strict
firewall rules to block all public access to TCP port 3306. Access
should be restricted to a minimal set of trusted internal IP
addresses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Short-Term Action (Remediation):</strong> Develop and
execute a plan to upgrade the MySQL 5.7 instance to a currently
supported version (e.g., MySQL 8.x). This is essential to ensure the
service receives ongoing security patches.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Long-Term Action (Architectural):</strong> Re-architect
the application environment to place the database in a private network
segment, inaccessible from the public internet. Access should only be
granted through a secure channel like a VPN or a bastion host.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="critical-risk-lack-of-endpoint-mfa">Critical Risk: Lack of
Endpoint MFA</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Action (Planning):</strong> Begin evaluating
and selecting an MFA solution that integrates with your current endpoint
operating systems (e.g., Windows Hello for Business, Duo,
Okta).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Short-Term Action (Implementation):</strong> Roll out MFA
for computer logins, starting with a pilot group of IT staff and
executives, before expanding to the entire organization.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Long-Term Action (Policy):</strong> Update the
organization’s access control policy to mandate the use of MFA for all
endpoint, application, and remote access logins.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="high-risk-insufficient-security-awareness-training">High Risk:
Insufficient Security Awareness Training</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Action (Procurement/Scheduling):</strong>
Select a reputable security awareness training platform or provider and
schedule mandatory annual training for all employees.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Short-Term Action (Execution):</strong> Conduct the first
organization-wide training session, ensuring completion is tracked.
Focus on key topics like phishing, password hygiene, and acceptable
use.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Long-Term Action (Program Development):</strong>
Establish a continuous security awareness program that includes regular
training, simulated phishing campaigns, and security newsletters to
maintain a high level of vigilance among staff.</p></li>
