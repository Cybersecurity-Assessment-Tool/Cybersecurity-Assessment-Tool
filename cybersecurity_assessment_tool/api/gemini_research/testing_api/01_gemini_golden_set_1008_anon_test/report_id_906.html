<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the cybersecurity
posture for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, synthesizing data from
a technical network scan, a security controls questionnaire, and a
review of pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The assessment reveals a critical disparity between the
organization’s technical and procedural security controls. While the
external network scan of <code>[Target IP]</code> showed a positive
security posture with no exposed services, the organizational controls
exhibit significant weaknesses. The complete absence of Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) across email, computers, and sensitive systems,
combined with a lack of employee security awareness training,
constitutes a risk. These gaps leave the organization highly susceptible
to credential theft, phishing, and social engineering attacks.</p>
<p>A key finding is that the previously documented risk, "Unencrypted
Web Server," appears to be remediated, as the associated port (80/tcp)
was found to be closed during the scan.</p>
<p>Immediate remediation should focus on implementing MFA and
establishing a baseline security awareness training program. Addressing
these foundational controls will drastically reduce the organization’s
most significant avenues of compromise.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="organizational-information">Organizational
Information</h1>
<p>The following details were used as the basis for this assessment. The

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-controls">Analysis of
Controls</h2>
<p>The lack of MFA is the most severe weakness identified. Email is a
primary target for attackers, and without MFA, a single compromised
password can lead to a full account takeover. Similarly, the absence of
security awareness training means that even with policies in place,
employees are not equipped to recognize or respond to common threats
like phishing, significantly increasing organizational risk.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan

<p>An external network scan was performed to identify exposed services

<p>The scan revealed no open ports on the target system. This indicates
a strong network perimeter defense, likely due to a well-configured
firewall.</p>

now <strong>closed</strong>. This is a positive finding, suggesting that
the risk has been successfully remediated. This should be formally
updated in the organization’s risk register.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="priority-1-implement-multi-factor-authentication-critical">Priority
1: Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (Critical)</h2>
<p>This is the single most effective control to prevent unauthorized
access.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Action:</strong> Enforce MFA on all
externally-facing services, with the highest priority on email
(<code>[Domain]</code>).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Long-Term Strategy:</strong> Phase in MFA for all
employee computer logins and access to all systems containing sensitive
data.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="priority-2-establish-security-awareness-program-high">Priority 2:
Establish Security Awareness Program (High)</h2>
<p>An aware workforce is a critical layer of defense.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Action:</strong> Provide foundational security
awareness training to all current employees and integrate it into the
onboarding process for new hires.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Long-Term Strategy:</strong> Implement a continuous
security training program, including mandatory annual refreshers and
periodic phishing simulation exercises to measure
effectiveness.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="priority-3-validate-and-update-risk-register-informational">Priority
3: Validate and Update Risk Register (Informational)</h2>
<p>Maintain accurate and current risk documentation.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Formally document the finding that Port
80 is closed and update the status of the "Unencrypted Web Server" risk
to "Remediated" in the internal risk register.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The current cybersecurity posture of <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong> is characterized by a strong external network perimeter
but critical internal and procedural weaknesses. The lack of MFA and
security training presents an unacceptable level of risk. By focusing
resources on the prioritized recommendations in this report, the
organization can significantly and rapidly improve its resilience
against the most prevalent cyber threats.</p>
