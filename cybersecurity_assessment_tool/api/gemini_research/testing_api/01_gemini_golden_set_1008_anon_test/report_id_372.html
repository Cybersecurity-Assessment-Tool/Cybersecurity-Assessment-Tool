<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment conducted for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The
assessment combined a review of administrative security controls via a
questionnaire with a technical network scan.</p>
<h4 id="overall-posture">Overall Posture:</h4>
<p>The organization demonstrates a mixed security posture. While strong
technical controls are in place for Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
across key systems, there are <strong>critical deficiencies</strong> in
foundational administrative controls. The complete absence of an
employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and any form of security awareness
training program presents a significant risk to the organization. These
gaps leave the organization highly susceptible to social engineering,
phishing attacks, and insider threats stemming from unintentional policy
violations.</p>
<h4 id="data-integrity-issues">Data Integrity Issues:</h4>
<p>It is crucial to note that the data provided for the technical
network scan (<code>Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON</code>) and the list of
current organizational risks (<code>Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON</code>)
were corrupted and could not be parsed. Consequently, this report’s
findings are primarily based on the analysis of the security control
questionnaire.</p>
<h4 id="key-findings">Key Findings:</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Positive Controls:</strong> The mandatory use of MFA for
email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems is a commendable and
effective security measure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Critical Gaps:</strong> The lack of an Acceptable Use
Policy means there are no formal guidelines for employees on the secure
use of company assets.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Critical Gaps:</strong> The absence of both new-hire and
annual security awareness training significantly increases the "human
factor" risk, as employees are not equipped to identify or respond to
modern cyber threats.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Recommendations in this report focus on urgently addressing these
administrative gaps to build a more resilient security culture and
reduce human-centric risk. A re-scan of the network perimeter is also
strongly advised.</p>

<h4 id="analysis">Analysis:</h4>
<p>The questionnaire reveals a clear divide in the organization’s
security strategy. Technical access controls (MFA) are well-implemented.
However, the foundational administrative controls that govern employee
behavior and security knowledge are entirely absent. This oversight
creates a significant vulnerability, as even the best technical controls
can be bypassed by a user who is tricked into giving away their
credentials or who unknowingly violates security protocols.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was intended to be performed on the target IP address
<code>[Target IP]</code>.</p>
<h4 id="data-corruption">Data Corruption:</h4>
<p>The raw data file containing the scan results
(<code>Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON</code>) was found to be corrupted and
could not be processed. Therefore, no analysis of open ports, running
services, or potential software vulnerabilities could be conducted as
part of this assessment.</p>
<p>It is imperative that a new, successful scan is conducted to identify
and remediate any technical vulnerabilities on the organization’s
network perimeter.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This risk assessment is based on the findings from the Security
Control Review. Due to data corruption issues with the technical scan
and the existing risk register, this assessment is limited to newly
identified administrative risks.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified
risks and improve the overall security posture of <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong>. Recommendations are prioritized based on severity.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>[Critical] Implement a Security Awareness Training
Program:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and mandate a comprehensive security awareness training
program for all employees.</p></li>
<li><p>This program must include an initial module for all new hires
during their onboarding process.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct mandatory annual refresher training for all staff to
cover the latest threats and reinforce security best practices.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider periodic phishing simulations to test and improve
employee vigilance.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>[High] Develop and Enforce an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Draft a formal AUP that clearly defines the rules and
responsibilities for all users of the organization’s IT assets.</p></li>
<li><p>The policy should cover topics such as data protection, password
security, internet and email usage, and the use of personal
devices.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all employees read and formally acknowledge the
policy.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>[Procedural] Conduct a New Network Vulnerability
Scan:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The external-facing IP address (<code>[Client IP]</code>) should
be re-scanned to identify technical vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p>The results of this scan must be analyzed and any identified
vulnerabilities should be remediated according to their
severity.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>[Procedural] Review Existing Risk Register:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Investigate the data corruption issue with the existing risk
register (<code>Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>Restore or rebuild the risk register to ensure that previously
identified risks are not overlooked and are being actively
managed.</p></li>
