<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity assessment
conducted for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The assessment
combined a review of organizational security controls, an external
network scan, and an analysis of pre-existing risk data.</p>
<p>The overall security posture is assessed as
<strong>High-Risk</strong>. Several critical vulnerabilities and
security gaps were identified that require immediate attention.</p>
<p>Key findings include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Critical Database Exposure:</strong> An outdated and
unsupported version of MySQL (5.7.33) is publicly exposed on the
internet. This version is past its end-of-life and contains known
vulnerabilities, presenting a direct and severe risk of data
breach.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Insufficient Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong>
MFA is not enforced for accessing email or for logging into company
computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access
through compromised credentials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inadequate Security Training:</strong> While new
employees receive security training, there is no mandatory annual
training program for all staff. This leads to a gradual decline in
security awareness and makes the organization more susceptible to social
engineering attacks like phishing.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Immediate remediation of these issues is strongly recommended to
reduce the organization’s attack surface and protect sensitive data.

<h4 id="analysis">Analysis:</h4>
<p>The lack of MFA for email and computer logins (<strong>No</strong>
responses) represents a critical weakness. Email is a primary target for
account takeover, and unprotected endpoints provide an entry point for
attackers to move laterally within the network. The absence of annual
security awareness training for all employees is a high-risk gap, as the
threat landscape constantly evolves and employee vigilance is a key
defense against phishing and other social engineering attacks.</p>

<p>The scan confirms that port 3306 is open, exposing a MySQL database
server directly to the internet. The detected version, <strong>MySQL
5.7.33</strong>, is particularly concerning for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>End-of-Life (EOL) Software:</strong> MySQL version 5.7
reached its official end of life in October 2023. This means it no
longer receives security patches from the vendor, and any newly
discovered vulnerabilities will remain unpatched.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Known Vulnerabilities:</strong> This specific version and
older versions in the 5.7 branch are associated with multiple publicly
disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) that could be exploited by attackers to
gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code, or cause a denial of
service.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This finding directly corroborates the pre-existing "Database
Exposure" risk and elevates its severity to
<strong>Critical</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="consolidated-risk-assessment">Consolidated Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>The following table synthesizes findings from the security
questionnaire, technical scan, and pre-existing risk data into a
prioritized list of security risks.</p>
<h1 id="sec:recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified
risks. They are prioritized based on severity and potential impact.</p>
<h2 id="immediate-actions-to-be-completed-within-72-hours">Immediate
Actions (To Be Completed within 72 Hours)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Restrict Database Access:</strong> Implement strict
firewall rules to block all public access to TCP port 3306 on
<code>[Target IP]</code>. Access should only be permitted from trusted
internal IP addresses or via a secure VPN connection.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2
id="high-priority-actions-to-be-completed-within-30-days">High-Priority
Actions (To Be Completed within 30 Days)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Enforce MFA Everywhere:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Immediately enable and enforce MFA for all user accounts on the
primary email system.</p></li>
<li><p>Develop and execute a plan to roll out MFA for all computer and
remote access logins.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Plan Database Upgrade:</strong> Initiate a project to
upgrade the MySQL 5.7.33 database to a currently supported version
(e.g., MySQL 8.x). This is critical for receiving future security
patches.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="strategic-actions-to-be-completed-within-90-days">Strategic
Actions (To Be Completed within 90 Days)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Annual Security Training:</strong> Procure and
implement a mandatory security awareness training program for all
employees, to be completed annually. This program should cover topics
such as phishing, password security, and acceptable use
policies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Secure Remote Access:</strong> If not already
in place, deploy a Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution for all remote
administrative access to internal systems, including the database
server. This provides a secure, encrypted tunnel and avoids direct
service exposure.</p></li>
