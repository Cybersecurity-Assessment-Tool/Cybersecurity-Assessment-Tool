<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment conducted on November 22, 2025. The assessment combined a
review of organizational security controls, an external network scan,
and an analysis of pre-existing risks to provide a holistic view of the
security posture for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>.</p>
<p>The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to identity and
access management, with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) consistently
enforced across email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. This
is a commendable and effective foundational control.</p>
<p>However, the assessment identified several areas of significant
concern that require immediate attention. Critical gaps were found in
administrative controls, specifically the absence of an employee
Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and a formal security awareness training
program. These deficiencies create a high-risk environment where
employees may be more susceptible to social engineering attacks.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the external network scan revealed a public-facing web
server running an outdated and vulnerable version of Nginx (1.18.0).
This technical vulnerability, coupled with the lack of employee security
awareness, presents a clear and present danger to the organization’s
data and reputation.</p>
<p>Overall, while the organization has a solid authentication framework,
its security posture is undermined by critical policy gaps and a
high-risk technical vulnerability. The recommendations in this report
are designed to address these specific weaknesses and significantly
improve the organization’s resilience against cyber threats.</p>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A review of administrative and policy-based security controls was
conducted via a standardized questionnaire. The results are summarized
below. "Yes" answers indicate a control is in place, while "No" answers
represent a gap in the security program.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-controls">Analysis of
Controls</h2>
<p>The consistent implementation of MFA is an excellent security
practice. However, the three "No" responses highlight critical
deficiencies in the organization’s governance and risk management
framework. The lack of an Acceptable Use Policy and any form of security
awareness training significantly increases the risk of human error
leading to a security incident, such as falling victim to phishing or
mishandling sensitive data.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network vulnerability scan was performed against the
target IP address <code>[Target IP]</code> on November 22, 2025. The
scan identified the following open ports and services.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of
Technical Findings</h2>
<p>The scan identified a single open port, 443/tcp, which is standard
for secure web traffic (HTTPS). The service running on this port is
Nginx version 1.18.0.</p>
<p><strong>This version of Nginx is significantly outdated and no longer
supported.</strong> Nginx 1.18.0 was released in April 2020. Since its
release, numerous security vulnerabilities have been discovered and
patched in subsequent versions. Running this outdated software exposes
the organization to a wide range of publicly known exploits, including
but not limited to request smuggling, denial-of-service, and potential
remote code execution vulnerabilities. This finding represents a
high-severity technical risk.</p>
<h1 id="consolidated-risk-assessment">Consolidated Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes the findings from the security control
review, technical scan, and any pre-existing known risks. As no

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the identified risks, the following prioritized actions are
recommended to improve the organization’s security posture.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Establish a Security Awareness Training Program
(Addresses RISK-001):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Immediately implement a mandatory security awareness training
module for all new hires as part of their onboarding process.</p></li>
<li><p>Procure and deploy a training solution to provide all employees
with annual training on topics such as phishing, password security, and
data handling.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct periodic phishing simulation campaigns to measure the
effectiveness of the training and identify areas for
improvement.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade Nginx Web Server (Addresses
RISK-002):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Plan and execute an upgrade of the Nginx server at
<code>[Target IP]</code> to the latest stable version.</p></li>
<li><p>Prior to the upgrade, perform testing in a staging environment to
ensure application compatibility.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement a patch management process to ensure the server and its
components are kept up-to-date going forward.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy (Addresses
RISK-003):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Draft a formal AUP that clearly defines the rules for using
company networks, devices, and data.</p></li>
<li><p>Have the policy reviewed by legal and HR departments.</p></li>
<li><p>Communicate the policy to all employees and require them to
formally acknowledge their understanding and agreement.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The security posture of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong> is a mix
of strong foundational controls and critical, unaddressed risks. The
robust MFA implementation provides a solid defense against
credential-based attacks. However, this strength is severely undermined
by the lack of employee security training, the absence of a governing
AUP, and a vulnerable public-facing web server.</p>
<p>By implementing the recommendations outlined in this
report—prioritizing the security training program, upgrading the
vulnerable Nginx server, and formalizing an AUP—the organization can
effectively mitigate these risks and build a more resilient and mature
security program.</p>
