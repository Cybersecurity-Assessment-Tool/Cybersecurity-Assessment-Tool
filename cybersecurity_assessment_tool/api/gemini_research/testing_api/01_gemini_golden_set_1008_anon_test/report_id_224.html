<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the cybersecurity
posture for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on a review of
organizational security controls, an external network scan, and an
assessment of current risks.</p>
<p>The assessment identified several areas of significant concern that
require immediate attention. Key findings include critical gaps in
endpoint security due to the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) on computer logins and a lack of recurring security awareness
training for all staff. These organizational weaknesses are compounded
by a technical vulnerability: an open, unencrypted HTTP port
(<code>80/tcp</code>) on the external network perimeter, which exposes
the organization to data interception and credential theft.</p>
<p>The overall security posture is considered weak, with multiple
high-risk vulnerabilities that could be exploited by threat actors. This
report outlines specific, actionable recommendations to mitigate these
risks and strengthen the organization’s defenses. Prioritizing the
implementation of endpoint MFA, establishing an annual security training
program, and securing web traffic with HTTPS are critical first
steps.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following details were used as the basis for this assessment. Due
to the anonymized nature of the provided data, placeholders have been
used where necessary.</p>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>An internal security questionnaire was reviewed to evaluate the
current state of administrative and organizational controls. The
responses indicate a solid foundation in some areas, but also reveal
critical gaps in user access and security culture.</p>

Gaps</h2>
<p>Two "No" responses represent significant risks to the
organization:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins:</strong> This is a
critical vulnerability. If an employee’s password is stolen (e.g., via
phishing or a data breach), an attacker can gain direct access to their
workstation and potentially the internal network. This single point of
failure bypasses other security measures.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Annual Security Awareness Training:</strong>
Security knowledge degrades over time, and threats constantly evolve.
Without annual refresher training, employees are more likely to fall
victim to phishing, social engineering, and other common attacks, making
them the weakest link in the security chain.</p></li>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and improve the overall security
posture, the following actions are recommended with high priority:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Mandatory MFA for All Endpoints:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Deploy a robust MFA solution (e.g.,
authenticator app, hardware token, or biometrics) for all employee
computer and laptop logins.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Drastically reduces the risk of
unauthorized access from stolen credentials. This is the single most
effective control to implement against this threat.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Enforce HTTPS and Disable HTTP:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediately configure the web server at
<code>[Target IP]</code> to redirect all HTTP traffic on port 80 to its
secure counterpart, HTTPS on port 443. If port 80 is not needed for
redirection, it should be blocked at the firewall.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Encrypts all web traffic, protecting
data in transit from eavesdropping and ensuring data integrity.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish a Continuous Security Awareness
Program:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop and mandate an annual security
awareness training program for all employees. This program should cover
current threats such as phishing, ransomware, and proper data handling.
Supplement this with regular phishing simulations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Builds a security-conscious culture and
empowers employees to become an active line of defense, reducing the
risk of human-error-related breaches.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The assessment for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong> reveals a
security posture with significant and exploitable weaknesses. While
foundational policies and some MFA controls are in place, the lack of
endpoint MFA and recurring security training, combined with an exposed
unencrypted web service, creates a high-risk environment. The
recommendations provided in this report are designed to address these
specific gaps directly. Swift implementation of these controls is
essential to protect the organization’s assets, data, and
reputation.</p>
