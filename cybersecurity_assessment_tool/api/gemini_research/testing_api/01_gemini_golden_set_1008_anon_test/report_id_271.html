<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the cybersecurity
posture for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on a combination
of organizational data, network scanning, and a review of current risks.
The assessment was conducted on [Scan Date], though this was not
provided in the scan data.</p>
<p>The analysis reveals several critical and high-risk security gaps
that require immediate attention. The most significant findings are the
absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer and sensitive
data system access, and a complete lack of a security awareness training
program for employees. These administrative control failures create a
substantial risk of unauthorized access and compromise through social
engineering or credential theft.</p>
<p>Technically, an exposed Secure Shell (SSH) service (Port 22) was
identified on the network perimeter at <code>[Target IP]</code>. While
necessary for remote administration, this service becomes a high-value
target for attackers, especially when foundational controls like MFA are
missing.</p>
<p>This report outlines the identified risks and provides prioritized,
actionable recommendations to mitigate them and strengthen the
organization’s overall security posture.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following details were used as the basis for this assessment.

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>An assessment of the organization’s administrative security controls
was performed based on a supplied questionnaire. The results indicate
significant gaps in access control and employee security training. "No"
answers represent a deviation from security best practices and are
flagged as risks.</p>

<h2 id="technical-analysis">Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>The scan identified an open SSH port (22), which is commonly used for
remote system administration. While this service is often required for
operational purposes, its exposure to the internet makes it a primary
target for brute-force and credential-stuffing attacks. The risk
associated with this finding is significantly amplified by the lack of
MFA for computer logins, as confirmed in the security control review. A
single compromised password could lead to direct administrative access
to a critical system.</p>

<p>The following table summarizes the key risks identified by
correlating the organizational data, technical scan results, and

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the findings, the following prioritized actions are
recommended to mitigate the identified risks and improve the overall
security posture.</p>
<h2 id="priority-1-remediate-critical-risks">Priority 1: Remediate
Critical Risks</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA Everywhere (RISK-001):</strong> Immediately
deploy a robust MFA solution for all employee computer logins and for
all access to systems containing sensitive or critical data. This is the
single most effective control to prevent unauthorized access.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="priority-2-remediate-high-risks">Priority 2: Remediate High
Risks</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Establish a Security Awareness Program
(RISK-002):</strong> Develop and implement a mandatory security
awareness training program. This program must be included in the
onboarding process for all new employees and conducted at least annually
for all staff.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="priority-3-remediate-medium-risks">Priority 3: Remediate Medium
Risks</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Harden SSH Service (RISK-003):</strong> Review the
business need for the exposed SSH service on <code>[Target IP]</code>.
If it is required:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Restrict access to a specific IP allowlist of trusted
administrative locations.</p></li>
<li><p>Disable password-based authentication and enforce the use of
strong cryptographic keys (e.g., ED25519).</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure the SSH service is patched and running an up-to-date
version.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The assessment for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong> has
identified significant and actionable gaps in its cybersecurity
defenses. While foundational elements like an acceptable use policy are
in place, the lack of critical access controls (MFA) and a formal
security training program presents a clear and present danger to the
organization. The exposed SSH service further exacerbates this risk.</p>
<p>By implementing the prioritized recommendations outlined in this
report, the organization can substantially reduce its attack surface,
improve its resilience against common cyber threats, and build a
stronger security culture.</p>
