<p><strong>Cybersecurity Posture Assessment Report</strong></p>
<p>Prepared for: <strong>[Organization Name]</strong></p>

<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment conducted for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The
assessment combined a review of administrative security controls via a
questionnaire, an external network vulnerability scan, and a review of
pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The overall security posture is a mix of strong technical controls
and a significant administrative gap. The external network scan of the
target IP address revealed an excellent security configuration, with no
open ports detected. This indicates a robust firewall implementation
that effectively minimizes the external attack surface. The organization
also demonstrates a strong commitment to identity security, with
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) widely implemented across key
systems.</p>
<p>However, a critical gap was identified in the organization’s
governance framework: the absence of a formal Employee Acceptable Use
Policy (AUP). This represents a <strong>High</strong> risk, as it can
lead to inconsistent security practices, misuse of corporate assets, and
a weakened ability to enforce security standards among employees.</p>
<p>Our primary recommendation is the immediate development and
implementation of a comprehensive AUP to mitigate this administrative
risk and strengthen the overall security framework.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>The organization has successfully implemented critical technical and
awareness controls, particularly regarding Multi-Factor Authentication
and security training. The single "No" response concerning the
<strong>Employee Acceptable Use Policy</strong> is a significant finding
and is addressed in the Risk Assessment section of this report.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed to identify open ports and
exposed services on the public-facing infrastructure.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> 2026-01-30</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="findings">Findings</h2>
<p>The scan results were positive, indicating a strong network security
posture for the scanned target.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> Up</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports Discovered:</strong> 0</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Filtered/Closed Ports:</strong> All 1000 scanned ports
were found to be in a ’closed’ state.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-1">Analysis</h2>
<p>No open ports were detected on the target system
<code>[Target IP]</code>. A ’closed’ state indicates that the firewall
is actively rejecting connection attempts, which is a secure
configuration. This significantly reduces the risk of external
network-based attacks by presenting a minimal attack surface to
potential adversaries.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section correlates findings from the security control review,
technical scans, and pre-existing risk data. Based on the inputs, no
pre-existing vulnerabilities were reported. The primary risk identified
during this assessment is detailed below.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified
risks and improve the overall cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> High</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Associated Risk:</strong> RISK-001</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Description:</strong> Draft a formal AUP that clearly
defines the rules for all employees and contractors regarding the use of
computers, networks, email, internet, and mobile devices. The policy
should cover topics such as data handling, password security, prohibited
activities, and the consequences of non-compliance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> This policy should be reviewed by legal
counsel, approved by management, and communicated to all staff. Existing
employees and new hires should be required to read and formally
acknowledge the policy.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Maintain Strong Network Security Posture</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> Medium</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Associated Risk:</strong> N/A (Proactive
Measure)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Description:</strong> The current network security
posture is excellent. It is crucial to maintain this state.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Continue to perform regular, automated
vulnerability scans of all external-facing IP addresses. Implement a
formal change management process for any firewall rule modifications to
ensure the attack surface remains minimized.</p></li>
</ul></li>
