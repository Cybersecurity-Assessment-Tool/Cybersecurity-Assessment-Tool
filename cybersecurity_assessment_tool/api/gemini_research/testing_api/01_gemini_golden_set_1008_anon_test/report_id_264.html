<h1 id="executive-overview">Executive Overview</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment conducted for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong> on October
27, 2023. The assessment combined an external network scan, a review of
existing risks, and an analysis of a self-reported security controls
questionnaire.</p>
<p>The organization’s overall security posture has several positive
controls in place, such as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email
and computer access. However, significant and high-impact gaps were
identified that expose the organization to substantial risk.</p>
<p><strong>Key Findings Include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Critical Control Gaps:</strong> Multi-Factor
Authentication is not enforced for access to sensitive data systems.
Furthermore, there is a complete lack of a formal security awareness
training program for both new and existing employees. These gaps
significantly increase the risk of credential compromise and social
engineering attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>High-Risk External Services:</strong> The external
network scan of <code>[Client IP]</code> revealed services exposed to
the internet that present a high risk, including an outdated version of
OpenSSH and an exposed Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) service.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pre-existing Organizational Risks:</strong> The
organization has known high-severity risks, including a weak password
policy and the absence of a formal incident response plan, which
compound the technical vulnerabilities identified.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Immediate remediation of the identified critical and high-severity
risks is strongly recommended to reduce the likelihood of a security
breach. Detailed recommendations are provided in Section 6 of this
report.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following information was used as the basis for this assessment.
Due to the anonymized nature of the data provided, placeholders have
been used where necessary.</p>

<p>The following table summarizes the organization’s responses to a
security controls questionnaire. Answers marked with a red ’X’ ()
indicate a deviation from security best practices and represent a

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-control-gaps">Analysis of Control
Gaps</h2>
<p>The questionnaire reveals critical weaknesses in two key areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Access Control:</strong> The failure to require MFA for
sensitive data systems means that a single compromised password could
lead to a major data breach. This is the most critical control gap
identified.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Human Element:</strong> The complete absence of a
security awareness training program leaves the organization highly
vulnerable to phishing, social engineering, and other human-targeted
attacks. Employees are the first line of defense, and without training,
they are unprepared to identify or respond to threats.</p></li>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of
Technical Findings</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Outdated OpenSSH (Port 22):</strong> Version 7.4p1 of
OpenSSH is outdated and has several known vulnerabilities, including
CVE-2017-15906 (Username Enumeration). Attackers can leverage such
vulnerabilities to gain information about valid system users, which is a
precursor to brute-force or password-spraying attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Exposed RDP (Port 3389):</strong> Exposing Remote Desktop
Protocol directly to the internet is extremely high-risk. This service
is a primary target for ransomware gangs and other attackers who use
brute-force attacks or exploit vulnerabilities (like BlueKeep) to gain
full remote control of the system.</p></li>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the correlated risk assessment, the following actions are
recommended to improve the organization’s security posture.
Recommendations are prioritized by severity.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="immediate-actions-critical-priority">Immediate Actions (Critical
Priority)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Remediate Exposed RDP:</strong> Immediately place the RDP
service behind a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or a modern remote access
gateway with MFA. If RDP is not required, disable the service and block
port 3389 at the firewall.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data:</strong> Prioritize the
deployment of MFA on all applications, databases, and systems that store
or process sensitive data. This is the single most effective control to
prevent unauthorized access.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="high-priority-actions">High Priority
Actions</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement Security Awareness
Training:</strong> Establish a formal security awareness training
program. All new hires must complete training upon onboarding, and all
employees must complete it at least annually. Training should focus on
identifying phishing, password hygiene, and reporting security
incidents.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade Vulnerable Services:</strong> Upgrade the OpenSSH
service on the external server to the latest stable version to mitigate
known vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Strengthen Password Policy:</strong> Implement and
enforce a new password policy that aligns with NIST guidelines,
requiring longer passphrases and blocking common passwords.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop an Incident Response Plan:</strong> Create a
formal Incident Response (IR) plan that outlines the steps to take
during a security breach, including identification, containment,
eradication, and recovery. This plan should be tested
regularly.</p></li>
