<p><strong>Cybersecurity Posture Assessment Report</strong></p>
<p>Prepared for:<br />
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Date of Report:</strong> 2026-01-31</p>
<p><em>This report contains sensitive information and should be handled
with care. Distribution is restricted to authorized personnel
only.</em></p>
</div>
<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive assessment of the cybersecurity
posture for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on a synthesis
of network scan data, a security controls questionnaire, and a review of
pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The analysis has uncovered several <strong>critical-risk</strong>
findings that require immediate attention. A public-facing FTP server
was identified running a dangerously outdated version of
<code>vsftpd</code> (2.3.4), which is known to contain a critical
backdoor vulnerability (CVE-2011-2523). This server also permits
anonymous logins, exposing the organization to significant risk of data
breach and system compromise.</p>
<p>Furthermore, critical gaps were identified in the organization’s
access control policies. The lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
for computer logins and access to sensitive data systems dramatically
increases the risk of unauthorized access should an employee’s
credentials be compromised.</p>
<p>These technical vulnerabilities are compounded by procedural
weaknesses, including the absence of an employee Acceptable Use Policy
and a lack of recurring annual security awareness training. The
combination of these issues creates a high-risk environment. We strongly
urge the immediate remediation of the critical vulnerabilities outlined
in the Recommendations section to mitigate the imminent threats to the
organization’s data and operations.</p>

<strong>Response</strong> &amp; <strong>Analyst Notes</strong><br />
Do you require MFA to access email? &amp; &amp; Good practice. Reduces
risk of email account takeover.<br />
Do you require MFA to log into computers? &amp; &amp; <strong>Critical
Gap.</strong> Lack of MFA on endpoints allows for easy lateral movement
if credentials are stolen.<br />
Do you require MFA to access sensitive data systems? &amp; &amp;
<strong>Critical Gap.</strong> This exposes the organization’s most
valuable data to unauthorized access.<br />
Does your organization have an employee acceptable use policy? &amp;
&amp; <strong>High Risk.</strong> Without an AUP, employees lack clear
guidance on safe technology use, increasing insider threat risk.<br />
Does your organization do security awareness training for new employees?
&amp; &amp; Good baseline for onboarding new staff.<br />
Does your organization do security awareness training for all employees
at least once per year? &amp; &amp; <strong>High Risk.</strong> Security
knowledge degrades over time. Lack of annual training leaves the
organization vulnerable to evolving threats like phishing.<br />

<h2 id="analysis-of-findings">Analysis of Findings</h2>
<p>The presence of an FTP server running <code>vsftpd 2.3.4</code> is a
severe and immediate threat. This version, released in 2011, contains a
well-documented backdoor that was inserted into the source code. An
attacker can gain a command shell on the server by sending a specific
string as the username. Combined with the allowance of anonymous logins,
this server is trivial to compromise and poses a direct threat to the
integrity and confidentiality of the host system and the internal
network.</p>
<h1 id="correlated-risk-assessment">Correlated Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes all findings from the questionnaire,
technical scan, and pre-existing risk data into a unified risk
register.</p>

the internet with anonymous login enabled. &amp; <span
