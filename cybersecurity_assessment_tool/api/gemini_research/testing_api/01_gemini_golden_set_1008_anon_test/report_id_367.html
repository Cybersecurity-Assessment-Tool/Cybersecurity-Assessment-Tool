<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the cybersecurity
posture of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on a review of
organizational security controls, a network vulnerability scan, and an
assessment of pre-existing risks. The assessment was conducted on
2026-01-30.</p>
<p>The analysis revealed several critical and high-risk security gaps
that require immediate attention. The most significant findings include
a complete lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer
logins, and sensitive data systems. This represents a critical
vulnerability, as a single compromised password could lead to a
widespread system breach.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the organization lacks a formal security awareness
training program for both new and existing employees. This elevates the
risk of successful phishing attacks and other forms of social
engineering.</p>
<p>A technical network scan identified an exposed Secure Shell (SSH)
service on the external network perimeter. While necessary for remote
administration, its exposure without compensating controls like IP
whitelisting or enforced key-based authentication presents a
medium-level risk.</p>
<p>This report outlines these findings in detail and provides a
prioritized list of actionable recommendations to mitigate the
identified risks and strengthen the organization’s overall security
posture.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="security-control-review">Security Control
Review</h1>
<p>A review of foundational security controls was conducted via a
questionnaire. The results indicate significant gaps in identity
management and security awareness policies. A "No" answer highlights a
missing control and a potential area of high risk.</p>

Gaps</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> The
absence of MFA across all critical access points (email, endpoints, data
systems) is a critical weakness. It places the organization at extreme
risk of account takeover attacks, where a single stolen password can
grant an attacker full access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inadequate Security Awareness Training:</strong> While an
acceptable use policy exists, its effectiveness is severely undermined
by the lack of training. Employees are not being educated on current
threats like phishing, malware, or social engineering, making them the
weakest link in the organization’s defense.</p></li>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of
Technical Findings</h2>
<p>The presence of an open SSH port (22) indicates that a system is
configured for remote administrative access from the internet. While SSH
is an encrypted protocol, its exposure is a risk. It is a primary target
for automated brute-force attacks where attackers attempt to guess
usernames and passwords. Without strong password policies, MFA, or
IP-based access restrictions, this service represents a significant
entry point for an attacker. This risk is amplified by the
organization-wide lack of MFA.</p>

</ol>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The assessment has identified fundamental gaps in the cybersecurity
defenses of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. While the issues are
serious, they can be effectively addressed. By prioritizing the
implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication and establishing a robust
security awareness program, the organization can significantly reduce
its risk of a major security breach. Further hardening of the network
perimeter by securing exposed services will add critical layers of
defense. We recommend that the organization develop a formal plan of
action to address these recommendations promptly.</p>
