<p><span><strong>Cybersecurity Posture Assessment
Report</strong></span></p>

<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the cybersecurity
posture for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on a review of
organizational security controls, an external network scan, and an
assessment of current risks. The assessment was conducted on
2026-01-31.</p>
<p>The analysis reveals a mixed security posture. The organization
demonstrates a commitment to security through the implementation of
security awareness training and multi-factor authentication (MFA) for
email access. The external network scan of the target host indicates a
strong perimeter defense, as no open ports or services were
discovered.</p>
<p>However, several critical and high-risk gaps were identified in
internal security controls. The absence of mandatory MFA for computer
logins and access to sensitive data systems presents a significant risk
of unauthorized access and potential data breach. Furthermore, the lack
of a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy creates ambiguity regarding
security responsibilities and acceptable behavior, weakening the overall
security culture.</p>
<p>Immediate remediation should focus on implementing robust MFA across
all critical systems and developing foundational security policies to
mitigate these identified risks.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>The following table summarizes the organization’s responses to a
security controls questionnaire. This review provides insight into the
current state of implemented policies and procedures. A green checkmark
() indicates a positive control, while a red cross () highlights a
potential gap.</p>

<h4 id="analysis">Analysis:</h4>
<p>The questionnaire reveals critical gaps in access control. While
email is protected by MFA, the failure to extend this protection to
computer logins and sensitive data systems exposes the organization to
significant risk from compromised credentials. Additionally, the absence
of an Acceptable Use Policy is a foundational governance gap.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network vulnerability scan was performed to identify
exposed services and potential vulnerabilities on the organization’s
perimeter.</p>
<h2 id="nmap-scan-findings">Nmap Scan Findings</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not provided in scan data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> Up</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Key Finding:</strong> The scan confirmed the host is
online but discovered <strong>no open TCP ports</strong>. All 1000
scanned ports were in a ’closed’ state.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="analysis-1">Analysis:</h4>
<p>This result is a positive security finding. It indicates that the
target system has a well-configured firewall that is effectively
blocking unsolicited inbound connection attempts from the internet. This
significantly reduces the external attack surface of the scanned
asset.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes findings from the security control review
and technical scan. The following risks have been identified and
prioritized based on their potential impact on the organization. No
pre-existing vulnerabilities were provided for this assessment.</p>

</div>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actionable recommendations are provided to address the
identified risks. They are prioritized based on severity to guide
remediation efforts effectively.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Deploy MFA for All Sensitive Systems
(Critical):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediately prioritize the
implementation of a robust MFA solution for all applications, databases,
and systems that store or process sensitive or critical organizational
data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> This is the most effective single
control to prevent unauthorized access to the organization’s most
valuable assets in the event of a credential compromise.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Enforce MFA for All Computer Logins (High):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Implement MFA for all employee and
privileged user logins to company-managed workstations and servers
(Windows, macOS, Linux).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> This measure protects the primary
entry point to the corporate network and prevents attackers from easily
moving laterally after stealing a user’s password.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(Medium):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Draft, approve, and disseminate a formal
AUP that clearly defines the rules for using company IT assets, data
handling responsibilities, and the consequences of
non-compliance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> An AUP is a foundational
governance document that establishes a baseline for secure user behavior
and empowers the organization to enforce its security
standards.</p></li>
</ul></li>
