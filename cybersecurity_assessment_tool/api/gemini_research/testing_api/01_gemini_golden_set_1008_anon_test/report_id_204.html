<p><strong>Cybersecurity Posture Assessment</strong></p>
<p>Prepared for:</p>
<p><strong>[Organization Name]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 2026-01-30</p>

<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a cybersecurity assessment for
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on an analysis of
organizational security controls and technical scan data. The assessment
reveals a mixed security posture with several effective controls in
place but also identifies critical gaps that expose the organization to
significant risk.</p>
<p>Key findings indicate that while the organization has implemented
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive systems and
conducts regular security awareness training, two critical deficiencies
were identified:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins:</strong> The absence of
MFA on employee workstations presents a high-impact risk, as a single
compromised password could grant an attacker direct access to the
internal network.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> This
policy gap creates ambiguity for employees regarding the proper use of
company assets, potentially leading to unintentional data exposure or
misuse of resources.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The external network scan data
(<code>Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON</code>) and the list of current risks
(<code>Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON</code>) were found to be incomplete or
corrupted. Consequently, this assessment is primarily based on the
security questionnaire. A new technical scan is strongly recommended to
identify and remediate potential vulnerabilities on the external
perimeter.</p>
<p>This report concludes with actionable recommendations to address
these identified risks and strengthen the overall security posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following details were used as the basis for this assessment. As
per the provided data, key identifying information was anonymized and is
represented by placeholders.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Organization Name:</strong> <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Primary Email Domain:</strong>
<code>[Domain]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Assessed External IP:</strong>
<code>[Client IP]</code></p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>An administrative review of security controls was conducted via a
standardized questionnaire. The results highlight areas of both strength
and weakness in the organization’s current security policies and
practices. "No" answers indicate significant gaps that require immediate
attention.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-findings">Analysis of Findings</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strengths:</strong> The mandatory use of MFA for email
and sensitive data systems is a commendable control that significantly
reduces the risk of account takeover. Furthermore, the established
security awareness training program for both new and existing employees
helps foster a security-conscious culture.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> The two "No" responses represent
critical vulnerabilities. The lack of MFA on computer logins is a
primary vector for ransomware and lateral movement attacks. The absence
of an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) introduces legal and operational
risks, as there are no formal guidelines governing employee use of
corporate technology and data.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was intended to be a part of this
assessment. However, the provided data file
(<code>Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON</code>) was corrupted and could not be
parsed. Therefore, no analysis of open ports, running services, or
potential software vulnerabilities could be performed.</p>
<p>The target for the scan was identified as <code>[Target IP]</code>. A
full, uncorrupted scan is required to provide a complete picture of the
external attack surface. A placeholder table below illustrates the type
of information that a successful scan would yield.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the risk assessment, the following actions are recommended
to mitigate the identified vulnerabilities and improve the overall
security posture of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for All Computer Logins (Priority:
CRITICAL):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Deploy a robust MFA solution for all employee workstations,
laptops, and servers.</p></li>
<li><p>Solutions to consider include Windows Hello for Business, Duo
Security, Okta, or other hardware/software token-based systems.</p></li>
<li><p>This single control will drastically reduce the risk of
unauthorized access stemming from compromised credentials.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce an Acceptable Use Policy (Priority:
HIGH):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create a formal AUP document that clearly defines the rules for
using company networks, devices, software, and data.</p></li>
<li><p>The policy should be reviewed by legal counsel and communicated
to all employees.</p></li>
<li><p>Require all current and new employees to read and sign the policy
as a condition of being granted system access.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct a New External Network Vulnerability Scan
(Priority: HIGH):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Immediately commission a new, authenticated and unauthenticated
vulnerability scan of the external IP address (<code>[Client IP]</code>)
and any other public-facing assets.</p></li>
<li><p>The goal is to identify all open ports, running services, and
associated vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p>Remediate any discovered critical or high-severity
vulnerabilities within 30 days.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p><strong>[Organization Name]</strong> has established a solid
foundation for its cybersecurity program, particularly concerning email
security and employee training. However, the critical gaps identified in
this report—namely the lack of MFA for computer access and the absence
of a formal Acceptable Use Policy—present an unacceptable level of
risk.</p>
<p>By implementing the prioritized recommendations outlined in this
document, the organization can significantly enhance its resilience
against common cyber threats, protect its sensitive data, and build a
more robust and defensible security posture.</p>
