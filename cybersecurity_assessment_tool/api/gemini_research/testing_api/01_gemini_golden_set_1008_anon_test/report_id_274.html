<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the cybersecurity
posture of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on a review of
organizational security controls, an external network vulnerability
scan, and a summary of pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The assessment revealed a mixed security posture. On a positive note,
the external network scan of the target IP address indicated a strong
perimeter defense, as no open ports or services were discovered. This
suggests that the external-facing firewall is well-configured and
effectively limits the organization’s attack surface.</p>
<p>However, the review of internal security controls identified two
high-risk gaps that require immediate attention. Firstly, Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) is not enforced for accessing sensitive data
systems. This creates a significant risk of unauthorized access and data
breach if user credentials are compromised. Secondly, new employees do
not receive mandatory security awareness training during their
onboarding process, leaving a critical window of vulnerability to social
engineering and unintentional policy violations.</p>
<p>This report details these findings and provides actionable
recommendations to mitigate the identified risks and strengthen the
organization’s overall security framework.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>This section outlines the basic information for the organization
under review. This data is used to define the scope of the

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A security questionnaire was completed to evaluate the implementation
of key administrative and technical controls. The results are summarized
below. A green checkmark (<span style="color: green"></span>) indicates
a positive control is in place, while a red cross (<span

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-control-gaps">Analysis of Control
Gaps</h2>
<p>The review identified two significant control gaps:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Systems:</strong> While MFA is
commendably used for email and computer logins, its absence on sensitive
data systems exposes critical assets to credential theft
attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Onboarding Security Training:</strong> New employees
are a primary target for attackers. The lack of security training during
the onboarding process means they are not equipped to recognize threats
like phishing or understand internal security policies from day
one.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was conducted to identify open ports,
running services, and potential vulnerabilities on the organization’s
public-facing infrastructure.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not provided in scan data.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="findings">Findings</h2>
<p>The scan completed successfully and found <strong>no open
ports</strong>. All 1000 scanned TCP ports were in a ‘closed‘ or
‘filtered‘ state. This is a strong positive finding, indicating that the
network perimeter is well-secured and does not expose any services to
the public internet at this address.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes findings from the security control review,
technical scan, and pre-existing risk data. The primary risks identified
stem from gaps in administrative and access controls. No technical
vulnerabilities were discovered during the external scan, and no
pre-existing vulnerabilities were provided for this assessment.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the risk assessment, the following high-priority actions are
recommended to enhance the organization’s security posture.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>High Priority: Implement MFA for Sensitive
Systems</strong><br />
<em>Description:</em> Procure and deploy an MFA solution for all
applications and systems classified as containing sensitive or critical
data. This control should be mandatory for all users, including
administrators and executives.<br />
<em>Impact:</em> Drastically reduces the risk of unauthorized access
from compromised passwords, protecting the organization’s most valuable
data assets.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>High Priority: Establish Mandatory Onboarding Security
Training</strong><br />
<em>Description:</em> Develop a mandatory security awareness training
module to be included in the formal onboarding process for all new
employees and contractors. This training should cover, at a minimum:
phishing and social engineering awareness, acceptable use policies,
password security, and incident reporting procedures.<br />
<em>Impact:</em> Equips new hires with the knowledge to act as a human
firewall from their first day, reducing susceptibility to common cyber
threats and reinforcing a culture of security.</p></li>
