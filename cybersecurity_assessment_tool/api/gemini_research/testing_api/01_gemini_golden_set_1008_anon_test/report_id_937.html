<h1 id="executive-overview">Executive Overview</h1>
<p>This assessment was conducted to evaluate the current cybersecurity
posture of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The analysis combined
technical scanning of external infrastructure with a review of internal
security policies and procedures.</p>
<p>The results reveal several areas of high concern. The most critical
findings are related to fundamental administrative controls. The
organization lacks Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and
sensitive data systems, has no formal Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), and
does not conduct security awareness training. These gaps create a
significant risk of account compromise, data breaches, and insider
threats.</p>
<p>From a technical perspective, the external network scan identified a
public-facing web server running an outdated version of Nginx (1.18.0).
This version is known to have multiple security vulnerabilities,
presenting a direct and exploitable attack vector for external
threats.</p>
<p>The combination of weak administrative controls and a vulnerable
external perimeter places the organization at a <strong>High
Risk</strong> of a significant cybersecurity incident. Immediate
remediation is strongly recommended, focusing on implementing MFA,
patching the vulnerable server, and establishing foundational security
policies and training programs.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-control-gaps">Analysis of Control
Gaps</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA Deficiencies:</strong> The lack of MFA on email and
sensitive data systems is a critical vulnerability. Email is a primary
target for phishing and Business Email Compromise (BEC) attacks. Without
MFA, a single compromised password could lead to a full breach of email
and sensitive corporate data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Policy and Training Gaps:</strong> The absence of an
Acceptable Use Policy and any form of security awareness training leaves
employees without guidance on secure behavior and makes them highly
susceptible to social engineering attacks. This fundamentally undermines
the organization’s human firewall.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Nginx 1.18.0 on Port 443:</strong> The web server is
running Nginx version 1.18.0, which was released in April 2020. This
version is significantly outdated and is no longer supported. It is
known to be vulnerable to multiple Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
(CVEs), including but not limited to issues that could lead to
information disclosure or request smuggling attacks. Running outdated
software on a public-facing server presents a high-impact risk that
could be exploited by automated scanners and malicious actors.</p></li>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the consolidated risk assessment, the following prioritized
recommendations are provided to mitigate the identified risks and
strengthen the organization’s cybersecurity posture.</p>
<h2 id="immediate-priority-remediate-within-30-days">Immediate Priority
(Remediate within 30 days)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Comprehensive MFA (RISK-001):</strong> Enforce
MFA across all user accounts for email access (e.g., Office 365, Google
Workspace) and any systems containing sensitive data. This is the single
most effective control to prevent unauthorized access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade Nginx Web Server (RISK-002):</strong> Immediately
plan and execute an upgrade of the Nginx server from version 1.18.0 to
the latest stable release. Ensure a process is in place for ongoing
patching and security updates for all internet-facing systems.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="high-priority-remediate-within-90-days">High Priority (Remediate
within 90 days)</h2>
<ol start="3">
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(RISK-003):</strong> Create a formal AUP that clearly defines the rules
and responsibilities for all employees when using company technology and
data. This policy should be signed by all employees.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish a Security Awareness Training Program
(RISK-003):</strong> Launch a mandatory security awareness training
program for all employees. The program should include initial training
for new hires and at least one annual refresher for all staff, covering
topics like phishing, password security, and data handling.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="general-recommendations">General Recommendations</h2>
<ol start="5">
<li><p><strong>Implement a Vulnerability Management Program:</strong>
Establish a formal process to regularly scan internal and external
assets for vulnerabilities, track findings, and remediate them based on
risk.</p></li>
