<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This assessment has identified several critical and high-risk
findings that expose <strong>[Organization Name]</strong> to significant
cybersecurity threats. The analysis reveals foundational gaps in
security controls, which are exacerbated by a publicly exposed network
service.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Findings</strong> include the complete absence of a
security awareness training program and the lack of Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. These
deficiencies create a high probability of credential compromise and
subsequent unauthorized access to the organization’s most valuable
assets.</p>
<p><strong>High-Risk Findings</strong> include an exposed Secure Shell
(SSH) service on the network perimeter, the absence of MFA for computer
logins, and the lack of an employee acceptable use policy. This
combination of technical vulnerability and policy gaps provides a clear
path for attackers to breach the network and move laterally with minimal
resistance.</p>
<p>The pre-existing risk register was empty, indicating that all
findings in this report are newly identified. Immediate and decisive
action is required to address these vulnerabilities and mitigate the
risk of a significant security incident.</p>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A review of the organization’s security controls was conducted via a
questionnaire. The responses highlight significant gaps in identity and
access management, policy, and employee training. A "No" response
indicates a missing control and a potential security risk.</p>

<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The presence of an open SSH port is a
significant finding. While necessary for remote administration, public
exposure without proper controls (e.g., IP whitelisting, key-based
authentication, intrusion prevention) presents a high-value target for
attackers.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>The following table synthesizes findings from the security control
review, technical scan, and pre-existing risk data. Each risk is
assigned a severity level based on its potential impact and
likelihood.</p>
<div class="tabular">
<p><span>@lL<span>7cm</span>l@</span> <strong>ID</strong> &amp;
<strong>Risk Description</strong> &amp; <strong>Severity</strong><br />
RISK-001 &amp; <strong>Lack of MFA on Sensitive Systems:</strong> No MFA
requirement for &amp; <span
style="background-color: critical"><strong>CRITICAL</strong></span><br />
&amp; sensitive data access allows a single compromised password to lead
to a major data breach. &amp;<br />
RISK-002 &amp; <strong>No Security Awareness Training:</strong>
Employees are not trained to &amp; <span
style="background-color: critical"><strong>CRITICAL</strong></span><br />
&amp; recognize or report phishing and other social engineering attacks,
making them a primary target. &amp;<br />
RISK-003 &amp; <strong>Exposed SSH Service:</strong> Port 22 is open to
the internet, inviting &amp; <span
style="background-color: high"><strong>HIGH</strong></span><br />
&amp; automated brute-force attacks against user credentials to gain a
network foothold. &amp;<br />
RISK-004 &amp; <strong>Lack of MFA on Computers:</strong> A compromised
password allows an &amp; <span
style="background-color: high"><strong>HIGH</strong></span><br />
&amp; attacker to log into an employee’s computer, gaining access to
local data and network resources. &amp;<br />
RISK-005 &amp; <strong>No Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> The
absence of a formal &amp; <span
style="background-color: high"><strong>HIGH</strong></span><br />
&amp; AUP creates ambiguity regarding secure practices and limits the
organization’s ability to enforce them. &amp;<br />
</p>
</div>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified
risks. Recommendations are prioritized based on risk severity.</p>
<div class="tabular">
<p><span>@lL<span>10cm</span>@</span> <strong>Risk ID</strong> &amp;
<strong>Recommended Action</strong><br />
<strong>RISK-001</strong> &amp; <strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive
Systems:</strong> Immediately deploy and enforce a strong MFA solution
(e.g., authenticator app, hardware token) for all access to systems
containing sensitive or critical data.<br />
<strong>RISK-002</strong> &amp; <strong>Establish a Security Training
Program:</strong> Procure and implement a mandatory security awareness
training program for all employees. This must be completed by new hires
upon onboarding and by all staff at least annually.<br />
<strong>RISK-003</strong> &amp; <strong>Secure the SSH
Service:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>If remote SSH access is not required, block port 22 at the
firewall.</p></li>
<li><p>If required, restrict access to a whitelist of trusted IP
addresses.</p></li>
<li><p>Enforce strong, key-based authentication and disable
password-based logins.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><br />
<strong>RISK-004</strong> &amp; <strong>Enforce MFA for Endpoint
Login:</strong> Deploy MFA for all workstation and laptop logins to
protect against credential theft and unauthorized local access.<br />
<strong>RISK-005</strong> &amp; <strong>Develop an Acceptable Use
Policy:</strong> Draft, approve, and communicate a formal AUP that
clearly defines the rules for using company IT assets, data, and network
resources.<br />
