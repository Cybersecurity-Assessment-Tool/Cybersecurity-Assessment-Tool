<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-overview">1. Executive
Overview</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment conducted for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong> on
November 22, 2025. The assessment combined an external network scan, a
review of organizational security controls via a questionnaire, and an
analysis of pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The organization demonstrates a strong foundation in identity and
access management, with commendable implementation of Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) across email, computer logins, and sensitive data
systems. An acceptable use policy and security training for new hires
are also in place, which are positive indicators of a security-conscious
culture.</p>
<p>However, two significant risks were identified that require immediate
attention:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Critical Risk - Outdated Web Server Software:</strong> An
external scan identified an Nginx web server running version 1.18.0.
This version is several years old, no longer receives security updates,
and is known to be vulnerable to multiple high-severity exploits. This
exposes the organization to potential data breaches, denial-of-service
attacks, and system compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>High Risk - Security Training Gap:</strong> The
organization does not provide mandatory annual security awareness
training for all employees. This creates a significant gap in the human
firewall, as evolving threats like sophisticated phishing and social
engineering tactics may go unrecognized, increasing the likelihood of a
security incident.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>No pre-existing vulnerabilities were reported for this assessment.
The overall security posture is considered <strong>Moderate
Risk</strong>. While foundational controls are strong, the critical-risk
technical vulnerability and the high-risk administrative gap present
clear and present dangers to the organization’s security. This report
provides actionable recommendations to mitigate these risks
effectively.</p>

</div>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>The questionnaire reveals a significant gap in the organization’s
security training program. While new employees receive initial training,
the absence of a mandatory annual refresher course for <em>all</em>
staff is a high-risk oversight. The threat landscape evolves
continuously, and without ongoing education, employees become more
susceptible to modern phishing, ransomware, and social engineering
attacks. This gap undermines other technical controls and increases the
overall risk profile.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-1">Analysis</h2>
<p>The scan identified a single open port, 443 (HTTPS), running an Nginx
web server. The detected version, <strong>1.18.0</strong>, is critically
outdated. This version was released in April 2020 and has since been
superseded by numerous stable and mainline releases.</p>
<p>Running outdated software, especially a public-facing web server, is
a severe security risk. Nginx 1.18.0 is known to be vulnerable to
multiple Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), including those
that could lead to request smuggling, denial of service, or information
disclosure. Attackers actively scan the internet for such unpatched
systems, making this a high-priority target for remediation.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">6. Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and improve the overall security
posture of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, the following actions
are recommended.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade Nginx Web Server (RISK-001 -
Critical):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediately plan and execute an upgrade
of the Nginx server on host <code>[Target IP]</code> from version 1.18.0
to the latest stable version.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> Upgrading will patch numerous
known vulnerabilities, protecting the server and its data from
compromise. This is the most urgent technical remediation
required.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Follow-up:</strong> Implement a patch management policy
to ensure all public-facing software is reviewed and updated on a
regular basis (e.g., quarterly).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Annual Security Training (RISK-002 -
High):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop and implement a mandatory annual
security awareness training program for all employees, contractors, and
executives.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> Regular training reinforces
security best practices and educates staff on new and evolving threats,
strengthening the organization’s "human firewall" and reducing the risk
of security incidents caused by human error.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Follow-up:</strong> Track completion rates to ensure 100%
compliance and consider periodic phishing simulations to test and
validate the effectiveness of the training.</p></li>
</ul></li>
