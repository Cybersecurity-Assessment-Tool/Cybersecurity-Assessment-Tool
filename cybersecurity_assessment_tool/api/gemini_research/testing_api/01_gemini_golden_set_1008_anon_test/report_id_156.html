<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a cybersecurity posture assessment for
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The analysis is based on a review
of organizational security controls provided via a questionnaire. It is
critical to note that the supplementary data feeds for the technical
network scan (<code>Input_1</code>) and pre-existing risks
(<code>Input_3</code>) were found to be corrupted and could not be
processed. Consequently, this assessment focuses primarily on policy and
procedural gaps identified from the organizational data
(<code>Input_2</code>).</p>
<p>The analysis reveals several critical and high-risk security gaps.
The most significant concerns are the lack of Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and access to sensitive data
systems. These omissions expose the organization to a high risk of
unauthorized access through compromised credentials.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the absence of a formal Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and
the failure to conduct annual security awareness training for all staff
members represent significant procedural weaknesses. These gaps increase
the likelihood of insider threats and successful social engineering
attacks.</p>
<p>Urgent remediation is recommended to address these foundational
security control deficiencies. A detailed list of risks and actionable
recommendations is provided in the subsequent sections of this report. A
new, verified technical scan is also strongly advised to identify
network-level vulnerabilities.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following details were used as the basis for this assessment. Due
to the anonymized nature of the input data, placeholders have been used
where necessary.</p>

<p><strong>Note on Data Integrity:</strong> The network scan data
provided for this assessment (<code>Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON</code>)
was found to be corrupted and could not be parsed. Therefore, a detailed
analysis of open ports, services, and potential vulnerabilities from the
network perspective could not be completed as part of this report. It is
strongly recommended to conduct a new, comprehensive vulnerability scan
against the target external IP address.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>The following risks were identified based on the security control
review. The risk data from <code>Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON</code> was
unavailable due to data corruption. The severity level is assigned based
on industry best practices, considering the potential impact and
likelihood of exploitation.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified
risks and improve the overall security posture of <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong>. Recommendations are prioritized based on risk
severity.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>[Critical] Implement Comprehensive MFA:</strong> Deploy a
mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication solution for all employee computer
logins (endpoints) and for all systems containing sensitive
organizational data. This is the single most effective control to
mitigate the risk of unauthorized access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>[High] Develop and Enforce an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a formal AUP that clearly defines the rules for
using company networks, devices, and data. This policy must be
communicated to all employees and formally acknowledged upon hiring and
on an annual basis.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>[High] Establish an Annual Security Awareness
Program:</strong> Implement a mandatory security awareness training
program for all employees, to be completed at least once per year. The
training should cover current threats such as phishing, ransomware,
business email compromise, and proper data handling.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>[High] Conduct a New Network Vulnerability Scan:</strong>
Due to the corrupted scan data, a new, authenticated and unauthenticated
external network vulnerability scan must be performed against the
public-facing IP address . All identified critical and high-risk
vulnerabilities should be remediated promptly.</p></li>
