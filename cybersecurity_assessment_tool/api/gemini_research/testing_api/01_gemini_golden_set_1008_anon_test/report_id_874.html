<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the cybersecurity
posture of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, conducted on
2026-01-31. The assessment synthesizes data from an external network
scan, a review of internal security controls via a questionnaire, and an
analysis of pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The assessment identified several critical and high-risk gaps in the
organization’s security controls, primarily related to identity and
access management and foundational security policies. While the external
network scan of the designated target did not reveal any open ports,
this should not be interpreted as a sign of robust security. The
policy-based vulnerabilities represent a significant threat to the
organization.</p>
<p>Key findings include the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
for email and computer access, the lack of a formal employee acceptable
use policy, and incomplete security awareness training. These gaps
expose the organization to substantial risks, including unauthorized
access, data breaches, and ransomware attacks. Immediate remediation of
these issues is strongly recommended to reduce the attack surface and
improve the overall security posture.</p>

questionnaire. A "No" response indicates a potential gap in security
that increases risk. Each gap has been assessed and is addressed in the
Risk Assessment section.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network vulnerability scan was performed to identify open
ports and exposed services.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> 2026-01-31</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="summary-of-findings">Summary of Findings</h2>
<p>The network scan completed successfully but did not identify any open
TCP or UDP ports on the target system.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> While the absence of open ports is a
positive finding, it typically indicates the presence of a
well-configured firewall or network access control list (ACL). This
prevents external attackers from directly discovering and exploiting
services. However, this result does not provide insight into the
security of internal systems or the risks associated with phishing,
malware, or credential theft, which can bypass perimeter defenses. The
policy gaps identified in Section 3 remain the primary source of
risk.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes findings from all data sources into a
consolidated list of identified risks. The severity level is determined
by the potential impact on the organization’s confidentiality,
integrity, and availability. No pre-existing vulnerabilities were
reported.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified
risks and strengthen the overall security posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="immediate-actions-0-30-days">Immediate Actions (0-30 Days)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement and Enforce MFA:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Enable MFA for all user accounts across
all email platforms (e.g., Microsoft 365, Google Workspace) and for all
remote and local computer logins.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> Prioritize implementation for
administrative and executive accounts, followed by a full rollout to all
employees.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> This is the single most effective
control to prevent unauthorized access resulting from stolen
credentials.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="short-term-actions-30-90-days">Short-Term Actions (30-90
Days)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Draft a formal AUP that clearly defines
the rules for using company networks, devices, and data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> Require all current employees to read
and formally acknowledge the policy. Incorporate this step into the
new-hire onboarding process.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> An AUP establishes a baseline for
secure employee behavior and is a foundational component of any security
program.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Onboarding Security Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Create a mandatory security awareness
training module for all new employees to be completed during their first
week of employment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> The training should cover key topics
such as phishing, password security, data handling, and the new
AUP.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> This ensures that security is
ingrained in the company culture from the very beginning of an
employee’s tenure, reducing unforced errors.</p></li>
