<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a cybersecurity posture assessment for
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, conducted on 2026-01-30. The
analysis is based on a review of organizational security controls, an
external network vulnerability scan, and a summary of pre-existing
risks.</p>
<p>The assessment reveals a mixed security posture. On a positive note,
the external network perimeter scan of the target IP address
<code>[Client IP]</code> showed no open ports, suggesting a
well-configured firewall that effectively limits external exposure.
Additionally, the organization enforces Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) for computer logins and conducts annual security awareness
training for all employees.</p>
<p>However, several critical and high-risk security gaps were identified
through the organizational questionnaire. The most severe findings
include the lack of MFA for accessing email and sensitive data systems.
These gaps expose the organization to significant risks of account
compromise and data breaches. Furthermore, the absence of a formal
Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and a security training program for new
employees indicates foundational weaknesses in security governance and
culture.</p>
<p>Immediate remediation is required to address the identified MFA and
policy gaps to reduce the risk of a significant security incident.
Detailed findings and actionable recommendations are provided in the
subsequent sections of this report.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-gaps">Analysis of Gaps</h2>
<p>The review identified four significant gaps:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>No MFA for Email:</strong> Email is a primary target for
phishing and account takeover attacks. The lack of MFA is a critical
vulnerability.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> Failure to
protect sensitive systems with MFA significantly increases the risk of a
data breach.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> An AUP is a
foundational policy that sets clear expectations for employee behavior
and use of company assets. Its absence can lead to inconsistent security
practices and insider threats.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Onboarding Security Training:</strong> New employees
are often prime targets for social engineering. Failing to provide
immediate security training leaves a critical window of
vulnerability.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed to identify open ports and
exposed services.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP:</strong> <code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> 2026-01-30</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="findings">Findings</h2>
<p>The scan completed successfully and found <strong>no open
ports</strong> on the target system. This is a positive security
finding, indicating that the perimeter firewall is likely configured to
deny all unsolicited inbound traffic, adhering to the principle of least
privilege. This significantly reduces the external attack surface of the
organization.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="consolidated-risk-assessment">Consolidated
Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section correlates findings from the security control review and
technical scans. The pre-existing risk register was empty, so all
identified risks are new findings from this assessment.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the consolidated risk assessment, the following actions are
recommended to improve the security posture of <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong>. Recommendations are prioritized based on severity.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="critical-priority">Critical Priority</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email and Sensitive
Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediately enable and enforce MFA for
all user access to the corporate email system (e.g., Microsoft 365,
Google Workspace).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Identify all systems containing
sensitive or critical data and enforce MFA for all access, both
privileged and standard.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> This is the single most effective
control to prevent account takeovers and subsequent data
breaches.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="high-priority">High Priority</h2>
<ol start="2">
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Draft a formal AUP that clearly defines
the rules for using company networks, systems, and data. The policy
should be reviewed by management, communicated to all employees, and
formally acknowledged via signature.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> An AUP establishes a baseline for
secure behavior and is a foundational component of a security governance
program.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Integrate Security Training into Employee
Onboarding:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Create a mandatory security awareness
training module for all new employees to be completed within their first
week of employment. This should cover key topics like phishing, password
security, and the new AUP.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> This closes a critical
vulnerability window and helps build a security-conscious culture from
day one.</p></li>
</ul></li>
