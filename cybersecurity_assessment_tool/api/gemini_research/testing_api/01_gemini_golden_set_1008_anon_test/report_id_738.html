<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity assessment for ,
based on a correlation of organizational data, an external network scan,
and a review of pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The assessment reveals a mixed security posture. The organization has
implemented some strong security controls, such as requiring
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems.
The external network scan of the target IP address, , showed a secure
perimeter with no open ports discovered, which is a significant positive
finding.</p>
<p>However, several critical and high-risk gaps were identified in
procedural and endpoint security controls. The most pressing issues
include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Endpoint MFA:</strong> The absence of MFA for
computer logins presents a significant risk, as a single compromised
password could grant an attacker direct access to an endpoint.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Missing Foundational Policies:</strong> The organization
lacks a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), creating ambiguity
regarding secure practices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inadequate Employee Onboarding:</strong> New employees do
not receive security awareness training upon hiring, leaving a critical
window of vulnerability.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The technical scan results contradict a previously identified risk
concerning an "Unencrypted Web Server" on port 80, as this port was
found to be closed. This suggests the risk has been remediated or was
based on outdated information.</p>
<p>Immediate action is recommended to address the identified policy and
endpoint security gaps to reduce the overall risk profile and enhance
the organization’s resilience against common cyber threats.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-gaps">Analysis of Gaps</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA on Computers:</strong> The lack of MFA on endpoints
is a critical vulnerability. If an employee’s password is stolen (e.g.,
via phishing), an attacker could gain direct access to their computer
and the corporate network.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> An AUP is a
foundational policy that sets clear expectations for employees on how to
use company assets securely. Its absence can lead to unintentional
misuse and security incidents.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>New Hire Training:</strong> New employees are often prime
targets for social engineering attacks. Failing to provide immediate
security training during onboarding exposes the organization to
unnecessary risk.</p></li>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actionable recommendations are provided to address the
identified risks and improve the overall security posture.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="high-priority-implement-endpoint-mfa">High
Priority: Implement Endpoint MFA</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Deploy Multi-Factor Authentication for
all employee computer and laptop logins. This control acts as a critical
barrier against credential theft-based attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Prioritize deployment for
privileged users (administrators) and executives. Solutions include
Windows Hello for Business, Duo Security, or hardware tokens like
YubiKeys.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="medium-priority-develop-and-implement-an-aup">Medium Priority:
Develop and Implement an AUP</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Create a formal Employee Acceptable Use
Policy (AUP) that clearly defines the rules and expectations for using
company technology and data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implementation:</strong> The policy should be reviewed by
HR and legal, communicated to all employees, and require a signed
acknowledgment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Resource:</strong> A great starting point is the SANS
Institute policy template library: <a
href="https://www.sans.org/information-security-policy/"
class="uri">https://www.sans.org/information-security-policy/</a></p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="medium-priority-integrate-security-into-onboarding">Medium Priority:
Integrate Security into Onboarding</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Make security awareness training a
mandatory component of the new employee onboarding process.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implementation:</strong> This training should occur
within the first week of employment and cover key topics such as
phishing, password security, data handling, and the new AUP.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>has established a commendable security perimeter, as evidenced by the
clean external network scan. However, significant internal and
procedural weaknesses currently expose the organization to substantial
risk. The lack of endpoint MFA, a formal AUP, and security training for
new hires are critical gaps that undermine other security
investments.</p>
<p>By implementing the high-priority recommendations outlined in this
report, the organization can significantly strengthen its defenses
against prevalent cyber threats, reduce its attack surface, and foster a
more security-conscious culture.</p>
