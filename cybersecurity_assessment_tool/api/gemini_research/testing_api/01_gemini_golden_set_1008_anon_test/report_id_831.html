<h1 id="executive-overview">Executive Overview</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity assessment
conducted for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The assessment
combined a review of organizational security controls, an external
network scan, and an analysis of pre-existing risk data.</p>
<p>The analysis revealed several high-priority risks that require
immediate attention. The most critical finding is the direct network
exposure of a MySQL database service. This service is running on a
version (<strong>MySQL 5.7.33</strong>) that has reached its End-of-Life
(EOL) as of October 2023, meaning it no longer receives security updates
and is highly susceptible to exploitation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, significant gaps were identified in the organization’s
security policies. The lack of mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) for email access presents a critical vulnerability to phishing and
account takeover attacks. This is compounded by the absence of a
recurring, annual security awareness training program for all employees,
which diminishes the organization’s resilience against social
engineering threats.</p>
<p>Collectively, these findings indicate a high-risk security posture.
The recommendations provided in this report are designed to mitigate the
most severe threats and establish a stronger security foundation.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following information was used as the basis for this assessment.
Due to the anonymized nature of the provided data, placeholders have
been used where necessary.</p>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A review of the organization’s security controls was conducted via a
questionnaire. The responses indicate a solid foundation in some areas,
such as MFA for computer and sensitive system access. However, two
critical gaps were identified that significantly increase organizational
risk.</p>

<p>The two "No" responses are major causes for concern.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>No MFA for Email:</strong> Email is the primary vector
for phishing attacks. Without MFA, a single compromised password can
lead to a full email account takeover, data breaches, and further
internal network compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Annual Security Training:</strong> The threat
landscape evolves constantly. Without annual training, employees are
less likely to recognize and appropriately respond to modern phishing,
ransomware, and social engineering tactics.</p></li>

<h4 id="analysis-1">Analysis:</h4>
<p>The scan identified that port <strong>3306</strong>, the default port
for MySQL, is open to the public internet. This is a highly dangerous
configuration as it exposes the database directly to attackers.
Attackers can perform brute-force password attacks, exploit known
vulnerabilities, or attempt to inject malicious code.</p>
<p>Crucially, the detected version, <strong>MySQL 5.7.33</strong>, is
<strong>End-of-Life (EOL)</strong> as of October 2023. EOL software no
longer receives security patches from the vendor, making it a prime
target for exploitation of newly discovered vulnerabilities. This
elevates the risk of this finding from High to
<strong>Critical</strong>.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified
risks. They are prioritized based on severity and potential impact.</p>
<h2 id="immediate-priority-secure-the-database-server">Immediate
Priority: Secure the Database Server</h2>
<p>The exposed, end-of-life database represents an active and severe
threat.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Containment:</strong> Implement strict firewall
rules to block all public access to TCP port 3306. Access should be
restricted to only trusted IP addresses. This is the most critical first
step.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Plan Upgrade:</strong> Develop an immediate plan to
upgrade the MySQL 5.7 instance to a currently supported version (e.g.,
MySQL 8.x) to ensure it receives security patches.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Long-Term Architecture:</strong> Relocate the database to
a private network segment. Future access should only be permitted
through a secure channel, such as a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or a
bastion host.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="high-priority-implement-mfa-for-email">High Priority: Implement
MFA for Email</h2>
<p>Protecting the primary communication channel is paramount.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Mandatory MFA Enforcement:</strong> Enforce MFA for all
user email accounts without exception. This single control dramatically
reduces the risk of account compromise.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="high-priority-establish-a-security-training-program">High
Priority: Establish a Security Training Program</h2>
<p>A well-informed workforce is a critical layer of defense.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Annual Training:</strong> Procure and roll out
a mandatory security awareness training program for all employees, to be
completed annually.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Phishing Simulations:</strong> Supplement annual
training with periodic phishing simulation campaigns to test and
reinforce employee knowledge in a practical setting.</p></li>
