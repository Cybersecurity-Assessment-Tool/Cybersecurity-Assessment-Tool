<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the cybersecurity
posture for , based on a combination of organizational policy review,
technical network scanning, and an assessment of known risks. The
evaluation was conducted on 2026-01-30.</p>
<p>The analysis identified several critical and high-risk security gaps
that require immediate attention. The most significant findings
include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> MFA
is not enforced for accessing email or other sensitive data systems.
This represents a critical vulnerability, as compromised credentials
could lead directly to a significant data breach.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Exposed Management Service:</strong> The technical scan
revealed that a Secure Shell (SSH) service on port 22 is publicly
accessible. Without proper controls, this exposes a key administrative
interface to brute-force attacks and exploitation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Policy Gaps:</strong> The organization currently lacks a
formal Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) for employees, creating ambiguity
regarding security responsibilities and acceptable behavior.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>While the organization has implemented positive controls, such as MFA
for computer logins and regular security awareness training, the
identified gaps substantially increase the risk of unauthorized access
and business disruption. This report details these findings and provides
actionable recommendations to mitigate the identified risks.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following details were used as the basis for this assessment. Due
to the anonymized nature of the input data, placeholders have been used
where necessary.</p>

<li><p><strong>External IP Address Scanned:</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A review of organizational security controls was conducted based on a
standardized questionnaire. The responses indicate key areas of strength
and weakness in the current security framework.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-control-gaps">Analysis of Control
Gaps</h2>
<p>The lack of MFA on email and sensitive data systems are the most
critical findings from this review. Email is a primary target for
phishing attacks, and a compromised account can serve as a launchpad for
further infiltration. Similarly, sensitive data systems without MFA are
highly vulnerable to credential theft. The absence of an Acceptable Use
Policy can lead to inconsistent security practices and a lack of legal
recourse in the event of insider misuse.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of
Technical Findings</h2>
<p>The open SSH port is a significant finding. While SSH is a secure
protocol, its exposure increases the attack surface of the organization.
If secured with weak passwords, or if it is unpatched, it could be
exploited by an attacker to gain a foothold within the network. This
risk is compounded by the lack of MFA on sensitive internal systems, as
a successful SSH compromise could lead to lateral movement with minimal
resistance.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended to
mitigate the identified risks and improve the overall security posture
of .</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="immediate-priority-critical-risks">Immediate
Priority (Critical Risks)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA on All Critical Systems:</strong>
Immediately deploy and enforce MFA for all user accounts accessing email
(e.g., Office 365, Google Workspace) and any systems identified as
storing or processing sensitive data. This is the single most effective
control to prevent account takeovers.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="high-priority">High Priority</h2>
<ol start="2">
<li><p><strong>Secure the Exposed SSH Service:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the SSH service on is not required for public access, it
should be firewalled off from the internet immediately.</p></li>
<li><p>If public access is required, restrict access to a whitelist of
trusted IP addresses.</p></li>
<li><p>Enforce strong, key-based authentication and disable
password-based logins for SSH.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="medium-priority">Medium Priority</h2>
<ol start="3">
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Draft a formal AUP that clearly defines the rules for
using company assets, handling data, and internet usage. Require all
employees to read and acknowledge the policy as part of their employment
terms.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="ongoing-improvements">Ongoing
Improvements</h2>
<ol start="4">
<li><p><strong>Continue Security Awareness Training:</strong> Maintain
the existing program for security awareness training for new and
existing employees. Consider incorporating modules that specifically
address the new AUP and the importance of MFA.</p></li>
