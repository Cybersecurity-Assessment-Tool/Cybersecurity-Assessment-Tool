<h1 id="executive-overview">Executive Overview</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the cybersecurity
posture for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The assessment is
based on a synthesis of network scan data, a review of organizational
security controls, and an evaluation of pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The analysis has identified several critical and high-risk
vulnerabilities that require immediate attention. Key findings
include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>A critically vulnerable public-facing service:</strong>
An outdated FTP server (<code>vsftpd 2.3.4</code>) was discovered on the
external IP address. This version is known to be susceptible to a remote
code execution backdoor (CVE-2011-2523). Furthermore, the service is
dangerously misconfigured to allow anonymous public login.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Significant gaps in access control:</strong> Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) is not enforced for accessing email or other
sensitive data systems, leaving these critical assets vulnerable to
credential compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Deficiencies in security governance:</strong> The
organization lacks a formal Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and does not
provide security awareness training to new employees, creating a weak
human firewall.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Systemic lifecycle management issues:</strong> The
continued use of an end-of-life operating system (Windows 7) on
workstations, coupled with the outdated FTP server, indicates a systemic
issue with patching and asset lifecycle management.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The combination of these findings presents a high likelihood of a
security breach. Immediate and decisive action is required to remediate
these issues and mitigate the associated risks. This report outlines
specific, actionable recommendations to improve the organization’s
security posture.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-control-gaps">Analysis of Control
Gaps</h2>
<p>The lack of MFA for email and sensitive data systems is a critical
weakness. Email is a primary target for account takeover attacks, which
can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and
further network intrusion. The absence of an Acceptable Use Policy and
security training for new hires means that employees are not equipped
with the necessary guidance to protect company assets from day one,
increasing the risk of insider threats and human error.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed against the target IP address
<code>[Target IP]</code>. The scan identified one open port with a
critically vulnerable service.</p>
<h2 id="port-21tcp-ftp---open">Port 21/tcp (FTP) - Open</h2>
<p>The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) port was found to be open and
accessible from the public internet.</p>

id="finding-1-critical-vulnerability---outdated-service-cve-2011-2523">Finding
1: Critical Vulnerability - Outdated Service (CVE-2011-2523)</h3>
<p>The running version, <code>vsftpd 2.3.4</code>, is a dangerously
outdated version released in 2011. This specific version contains a
backdoor that allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute
arbitrary commands with root privileges on the server. This is a
critical risk that could lead to a full system compromise.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="finding-2-critical-misconfiguration---anonymous-ftp-login">Finding
2: Critical Misconfiguration - Anonymous FTP Login</h3>
<p>The scan confirmed that anonymous FTP login is allowed. This
configuration permits any user on the internet to connect to the server
and potentially access, upload, or download files without any
authentication. This could lead to sensitive data exposure, malware
distribution, or be used as a pivot point for further attacks into the
internal network.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="finding-3-high-risk---insecure-protocol">Finding 3: High Risk -
Insecure Protocol</h3>
<p>FTP is an inherently insecure protocol that transmits all data,
including user credentials, in cleartext. Any attacker able to monitor
network traffic could easily capture login information. Secure
alternatives like SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) or FTPS (FTP over
SSL/TLS) should be used instead.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actions are recommended to address the identified
risks. They are prioritized based on severity.</p>
<h2 id="remediate-vulnerable-ftp-server-critical">Remediate Vulnerable
FTP Server (CRITICAL)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Action:</strong> Take the FTP service on
<code>[Target IP]</code> offline immediately. This is the most effective
way to eliminate the risk from the backdoor vulnerability and anonymous
access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Short-Term Action:</strong> If FTP is a business
necessity, replace <code>vsftpd 2.3.4</code> with a modern, secure file
transfer solution like SFTP (provided by OpenSSH). Ensure any new
solution is configured securely, with anonymous access disabled and
access restricted to authorized IP addresses only.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Preventative Action:</strong> Implement a vulnerability
management program to regularly scan for and remediate outdated software
on all external and internal systems.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="implement-comprehensive-mfa-high">Implement Comprehensive MFA
(HIGH)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Action:</strong> Begin a project to enable and
enforce MFA for all users on all email accounts (e.g., Office 365,
Google Workspace).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Short-Term Action:</strong> Extend the MFA requirement to
all systems that store or process sensitive data, as well as any remote
access solutions (e.g., VPNs).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="establish-foundational-security-policies-high">Establish
Foundational Security Policies (HIGH)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Action:</strong> Develop and implement a formal
Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) that all employees must read and
acknowledge. This policy should define the rules for using company IT
assets.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Short-Term Action:</strong> Integrate mandatory security
awareness training into the onboarding process for all new employees.
This ensures a baseline level of security knowledge from their first
day.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="modernize-operating-systems-medium">Modernize Operating Systems
(MEDIUM)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Execute the plan to upgrade all
remaining Windows 7 workstations to a supported operating system, such
as Windows 10 or Windows 11. This will ensure they receive critical
security patches from Microsoft.</p></li>
