<p><strong>Cybersecurity Posture Report</strong> Prepared for:

<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity assessment
conducted for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The assessment
combined a review of organizational security controls via a
questionnaire, an external network scan of public-facing assets, and an
analysis of pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The overall security posture is mixed. The organization demonstrates
strong identity and access management practices with consistent
enforcement of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). However, two high-risk
findings were identified that require immediate attention:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Critical Gap in Employee Onboarding:</strong> The lack of
mandatory security awareness training for new employees represents a
significant vulnerability. New hires are often prime targets for social
engineering and phishing attacks, and this gap exposes the organization
to an elevated risk of initial compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Vulnerable Public-Facing Web Server:</strong> The
external network scan identified an outdated version of the Nginx web
server (1.18.0) running on a public-facing system. This version is
several years old and has multiple known vulnerabilities, making it a
direct target for exploitation.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>No pre-existing risks were documented in the provided data.
Recommendations in this report focus on remediating these critical
findings to strengthen the organization’s defensive posture against
common cyber threats.</p>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A review of administrative and procedural security controls was
conducted based on a standardized questionnaire. The responses indicate
a solid foundation in access control but reveal a critical weakness in
the security training program.</p>

<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>The "No" response to providing security awareness training for new
employees is a <strong>High-Risk</strong> finding. The initial period of
employment is a critical window where new staff are unfamiliar with
company policies and are more susceptible to targeted attacks. Failing
to provide immediate training on topics such as phishing identification,
acceptable use, and data handling significantly increases the risk of a
security incident originating from human error.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>

<h2 id="analysis-1">Analysis</h2>
<p>The scan identified an Nginx web server, version
<strong>1.18.0</strong>, exposed to the internet. This version was
released in April 2020 and is now considered significantly outdated. It
is affected by several publicly disclosed vulnerabilities, including but
not limited to CVE-2021-23017. Running outdated software on
internet-facing systems is a <strong>High-Risk</strong> finding, as it
provides attackers with a well-known and often easily exploitable entry
point into the network.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified
risks and improve the overall security posture of <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Onboarding Security Training
(RISK-001):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop and mandate a security awareness
training module as a required step in the new employee onboarding
process.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Details:</strong> This training should be completed
within the first week of employment and cover core topics such as
phishing awareness, password security, acceptable use of company assets,
and how to report a security incident.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> Critical</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade Web Server and Implement Patch Management
(RISK-002):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediately plan and execute the upgrade
of the Nginx server on <code>[Target IP]</code> from version 1.18.0 to
the latest stable release.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Details:</strong> Establish a formal patch management
policy that requires quarterly reviews and timely application of
security patches for all internet-facing systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> Critical</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>While <strong>[Organization Name]</strong> has implemented
commendable access controls through MFA, this assessment highlights
critical deficiencies in security training and patch management that
undermine these strengths. By addressing the high-risk findings related
to new employee onboarding and the vulnerable Nginx server, the
organization can significantly reduce its attack surface and enhance its
resilience against prevalent cyber threats. Continuous monitoring and
proactive management of both human and technical vulnerabilities are
essential for maintaining a robust security posture.</p>
