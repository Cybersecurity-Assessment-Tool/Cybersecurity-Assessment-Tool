<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the cybersecurity
posture for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The assessment
combines a review of organizational security controls, an external
network vulnerability scan, and an evaluation of pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The key finding of this assessment is a significant disparity between
the organization’s external and internal security postures. The external
network perimeter appears strong, with no open ports detected on the
scanned public-facing IP address. This suggests a well-configured
firewall and a commendable "default deny" stance.</p>
<p>However, the review of internal security controls reveals critical
gaps that expose the organization to substantial risk. The absence of
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and access to
sensitive data systems is a primary concern. Furthermore, the lack of
mandatory security awareness training for new employees creates a
significant vulnerability to social engineering and phishing attacks.
These internal weaknesses could allow an attacker who gains a foothold
(e.g., via a compromised credential) to move laterally and access
critical assets with minimal resistance.</p>
<p>Immediate remediation should focus on implementing a comprehensive
MFA strategy and integrating security training into the employee
onboarding process.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-control-gaps">Analysis of Control
Gaps</h2>
<p>The questionnaire reveals three significant control deficiencies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins:</strong> This is a
critical vulnerability. If an employee’s credentials are stolen, an
attacker can directly access their workstation and any connected network
resources without a secondary authentication challenge.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Systems:</strong> Failure to
protect sensitive data systems with MFA means that a single compromised
password could lead directly to a major data breach.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Security Training for New Hires:</strong> New
employees are often prime targets for phishing and social engineering
attacks. Without immediate training, they are unaware of organizational
policies and common threats, making them a high-risk user
group.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed to identify open ports and
exposed services on the organization’s public-facing infrastructure.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Tool:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> 2026-01-30</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="findings">Findings</h2>
<p>The scan results were positive, indicating a strong perimeter
security posture.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> Up</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports:</strong> None detected.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Port State:</strong> All 1000 commonly scanned TCP ports
were found to be in a <strong>‘closed‘</strong> state. This means the
firewall is correctly configured to reject unsolicited incoming traffic,
significantly reducing the external attack surface.</p></li>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended to
mitigate the identified risks and improve the overall security posture.
Recommendations are prioritized based on severity.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Deploy MFA for All Endpoint Logins
(Critical):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Mandate and deploy a robust MFA solution
for all employee and contractor computer logins.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> This action directly mitigates
the risk of unauthorized access from compromised credentials, which is a
primary vector in ransomware and data breach incidents. Solutions can
include Windows Hello for Business, Duo Security, or other identity
provider integrations.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Enforce MFA on Sensitive Data Systems
(Critical):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Conduct an inventory of all systems
containing sensitive, proprietary, or regulated data. Prioritize and
enforce MFA for all user access to these systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> This creates a critical
defense-in-depth layer, ensuring that even if an attacker compromises a
user’s account, they cannot access the organization’s most valuable data
without a second factor.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Integrate Security Training into Employee Onboarding
(High):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop a mandatory security awareness
training module that is a required component of the new-hire onboarding
process. This training should be completed before a new employee is
granted full network access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> This ensures that all employees,
from day one, understand their security responsibilities, company
policies, and how to identify and report common threats like
phishing.</p></li>
</ul></li>
