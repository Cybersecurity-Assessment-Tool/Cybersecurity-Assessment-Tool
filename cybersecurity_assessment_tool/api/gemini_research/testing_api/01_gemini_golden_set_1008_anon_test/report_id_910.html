<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">1.0 Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity assessment
conducted for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The evaluation
combined a review of organizational security controls, an external
network scan, and an analysis of pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The assessment revealed a mixed security posture. On the technical
front, the external network scan of the target system showed a strong
perimeter defense, with no open ports detected. This is a positive
indicator of a well-configured firewall.</p>
<p>However, significant gaps were identified in administrative and
procedural controls. The organization currently lacks a formal Employee
Acceptable Use Policy and does not provide security awareness training
during the critical new employee onboarding phase. These policy and
training deficiencies introduce a high level of risk related to insider
threats and human error, which could undermine the effectiveness of
existing technical controls.</p>
<p>This report provides a detailed breakdown of these findings and
offers actionable recommendations to mitigate the identified risks and
strengthen the organization’s overall security posture.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="organizational-information">2.0

Review</h1>
<p>A review of the organization’s security controls was conducted via a
questionnaire. The responses indicate a strong implementation of
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) but reveal critical gaps in policy and
employee training.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">4.0 Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>An external network vulnerability scan was performed to identify
potential weaknesses in the organization’s internet-facing
infrastructure.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>

</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="findings">4.2 Findings</h2>
<p>The scan completed successfully and found <strong>no open
ports</strong> on the target system. This result strongly suggests that
a well-configured firewall or other network security appliance is in
place, effectively blocking unsolicited inbound traffic. This is a
commendable security practice that significantly reduces the external
attack surface.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment">5.0 Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes findings from the security control review,
technical scan, and pre-existing risk data. While no technical
vulnerabilities were discovered during the scan and no pre-existing
vulnerabilities were reported, the procedural gaps identified present a
tangible threat to the organization.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">6.0 Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified
risks and improve the overall security posture of <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong>.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="for-risk-001-lack-of-aup">6.1 For RISK-001:
Lack of AUP</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop and implement a comprehensive
Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). This policy should clearly define rules for
computer, network, email, and internet usage, as well as guidelines for
data protection and incident reporting.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implementation:</strong> The policy should be reviewed by
legal counsel, communicated to all current employees, and integrated
into the new employee onboarding process. All employees should be
required to formally acknowledge that they have read and understood the
policy.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="for-risk-002-no-new-employee-training">6.2
For RISK-002: No New Employee Training</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Establish a mandatory security awareness
training module as a required component of the new employee onboarding
process. This training should occur before or within the first week of
employment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implementation:</strong> The training should cover key
topics such as phishing identification, password security, safe browsing
habits, and the new Acceptable Use Policy. This initial training will
complement the existing annual refresher course and ensure a consistent
security baseline for all staff from day one.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">7.0 Conclusion</h1>
<p>The security assessment of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>
highlights a robust technical perimeter but reveals critical weaknesses
in administrative security controls. The absence of an Acceptable Use
Policy and the lack of security training for new hires represent the
most significant risks.</p>
<p>By implementing the recommendations outlined in this report—namely,
creating a formal AUP and integrating security training into the
employee onboarding process—the organization can substantially reduce
its exposure to human-factor risks and build a more resilient and
security-conscious culture.</p>
