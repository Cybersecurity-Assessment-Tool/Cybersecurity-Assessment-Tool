<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>The assessment reveals a mixed cybersecurity posture for
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The organization demonstrates a
strong commitment to security awareness, with established policies and
comprehensive training programs for all employees. This forms a solid
foundation for a security-conscious culture.</p>
<p>However, two critical-impact vulnerabilities were identified related
to the lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA) for accessing email and
logging into computers. These gaps expose the organization to
significant risks, including business email compromise, ransomware
attacks, and unauthorized data access resulting from credential
theft.</p>
<p>On a positive note, a technical network scan of the external IP
address <code>[Client IP]</code> showed that port 80 (HTTP) is closed.
This finding contradicts a previously documented risk of an "Unencrypted
Web Server," suggesting that remediation actions may have already been
successfully implemented.</p>
<p>The highest priority for the organization must be the immediate
implementation of MFA across all critical systems, starting with email
and endpoint logins. Verifying the closure of the historical risk
related to port 80 is also recommended to ensure the accuracy of the
risk register.</p>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>An administrative review of the organization’s security controls was
conducted via a questionnaire. The responses indicate a strong policy
and training framework but reveal critical gaps in technical access
controls. A "No" response () indicates a deviation from security best
practices and a potential risk.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on the target IP address to identify
accessible services and potential vulnerabilities.</p>

<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Tool:</strong> Nmap</p></li>

</ul>
<h2 id="open-port-analysis">Open Port Analysis</h2>
<p>The scan revealed no open ports on the target system. Notably, port
80 (HTTP) was explicitly checked and found to be in a
<strong>closed</strong> state. This is a positive security finding, as
it prevents unencrypted web traffic and reduces the external attack
surface. This result contradicts the pre-existing risk documented in
Input 3, suggesting that the risk has been remediated.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended to
mitigate the identified risks. Recommendations are prioritized by
severity.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>[High Priority] Implement Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA):</strong> This is the single most effective control to mitigate
the highest-priority risks.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Email Systems:</strong> Immediately enforce MFA for all
users accessing the corporate email system. This will protect against
account takeovers via phishing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Workstations/Endpoints:</strong> Deploy MFA for all
computer and laptop logins (e.g., via Windows Hello for Business, Duo,
or a similar solution). This creates a critical barrier against
unauthorized network access.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>[Medium Priority] Verify and Update Risk
Register:</strong> The technical scan indicates that the "Unencrypted
Web Server" risk associated with port 80 has been resolved.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Confirm with the system administrator that the closure of port 80
was an intentional act of remediation.</p></li>
<li><p>Upon confirmation, formally update the organization’s risk
register to mark this vulnerability as "Closed" or
"Remediated."</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>[Low Priority] Continuous Improvement:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Leverage the existing strong security awareness program to
educate employees on the importance of the new MFA controls being
implemented.</p></li>
<li><p>Continue regular network scanning and vulnerability assessments
to proactively identify and address new risks.</p></li>
</ul></li>
