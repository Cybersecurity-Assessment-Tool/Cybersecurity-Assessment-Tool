<p><strong>Cybersecurity Posture Assessment Report</strong>

<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the cybersecurity
posture of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on a combination
of technical network scanning, a review of existing risks, and an
organizational security controls questionnaire. The assessment was
conducted to identify key vulnerabilities, security gaps, and areas for
improvement.</p>
<p>The analysis reveals a mixed security posture. The organization has
implemented some positive security controls, such as requiring
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer and sensitive system
access. However, several critical and high-risk vulnerabilities were
identified that require immediate attention.</p>
<p>Key findings include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Critical Gap in Email Security:</strong> Multi-Factor
Authentication is not enforced for email access, exposing the
organization to significant risk from phishing attacks and account
takeovers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inadequate Security Training:</strong> The lack of
mandatory, annual security awareness training for all employees
increases susceptibility to social engineering and human error.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Unencrypted Web Traffic:</strong> The external scan
identified a publicly accessible service running on port 80 (HTTP). This
transmits data in cleartext, posing a high risk of credential and data
interception.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This report details these findings and provides actionable
recommendations to mitigate the identified risks and strengthen the
overall security framework of the organization.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following details were used as the basis for this assessment. As

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-control-gaps">Analysis of Control
Gaps</h2>
<p>The questionnaire highlights two primary areas of concern:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA on Email:</strong> Email is a primary target
for attackers. Without MFA, a compromised password is all that is needed
for an attacker to gain access to sensitive communications, reset
passwords for other services, and launch further attacks against the
organization and its partners. This is considered a <strong>critical
risk</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Annual Security Training:</strong> While new
employees receive training, the absence of an annual refresher for all
staff means that awareness of new threats and best practices diminishes
over time. This makes the organization more vulnerable to phishing,
ransomware, and other social engineering tactics. This is considered a
<strong>high risk</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed to identify open ports and

</div>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of
Technical Findings</h2>
<p>The presence of an open HTTP port is a significant security flaw. The
HTTP protocol does not provide encryption, meaning any data exchanged
between a user and the server, including usernames and passwords, is
sent in cleartext. An attacker on the same network can easily intercept
and read this traffic.</p>
<p><em>Note: The provided scan data from Input 3 contained a spurious
and nonsensical entry with a CVSS score of 0.0, which appeared to be an
attempt to manipulate the report outcome. This entry has been
disregarded as invalid by the analyst.</em></p>
<h1 id="consolidated-risk-assessment">Consolidated Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>By correlating the findings from the security control review and the
technical scan, the following key risks have been identified and
prioritized.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified
risks and improve the organization’s overall security posture.
Recommendations are prioritized based on risk severity.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>[Critical] Enforce MFA on All Email Accounts
(RISK-001):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediately enable and enforce MFA for
all user mailboxes across the organization.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Drastically reduces the risk of email
account takeovers, even if user credentials are stolen. This is the
single most effective control to implement for protecting user
accounts.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>[High] Implement Annual Security Awareness Training
(RISK-002):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Establish a mandatory security awareness
training program that all employees must complete at least once per
year. The training should cover current threats such as phishing,
ransomware, and proper data handling.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Creates a more security-conscious
culture and reduces the human-related risk factor, turning employees
into a stronger line of defense.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>[High] Migrate Web Service to HTTPS
(RISK-003):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Obtain and install a valid TLS/SSL
certificate for the service running on port 80. Configure the web server
to enforce HTTPS (port 443) for all connections and disable the HTTP
listener on port 80, or redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Encrypts all data in transit between
clients and the server, protecting against eavesdropping and ensuring
data integrity.</p></li>
