<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment conducted for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The
assessment incorporated a review of organizational security controls, an
external network vulnerability scan, and an analysis of pre-existing
risks.</p>
<p>The organization demonstrates a solid foundation in security
awareness, with established policies for acceptable use and mandatory
training for all employees. Furthermore, Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) is correctly enforced for computer and sensitive data system
access.</p>
<p>However, a critical security gap was identified: the <strong>absence
of mandatory MFA for email access</strong>. Email is a primary vector
for sophisticated attacks such as phishing, business email compromise
(BEC), and account takeover. This gap exposes the organization to
significant risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and financial
loss.</p>
<p>The external network scan of the designated target IP address did not
identify any open ports. This suggests a properly configured firewall is
in place, or the host was not responsive at the time of the scan. No
pre-existing vulnerabilities were reported for analysis.</p>
<p>The primary recommendation of this report is the immediate
implementation of MFA across all email accounts to mitigate this
critical risk.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following information was used as the basis for this assessment.

<p>The following table summarizes the organization’s responses to the
security controls questionnaire. A checkmark () indicates a positive
control is in place, while a cross () indicates a potential security gap
that requires attention.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>The questionnaire reveals a significant weakness. The lack of MFA on
email is a critical oversight, as email accounts are high-value targets
for attackers. A compromised email account can serve as a launchpad for
internal phishing campaigns, unauthorized access to sensitive data
shared via email, and password reset attacks on other integrated
services.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed to identify open ports and
exposed services on the organization’s perimeter.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Data not provided in scan
results.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Findings:</strong> The scan completed without discovering
any open TCP or UDP ports.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-1">Analysis</h2>
<p>The absence of open ports is a positive security finding. It
indicates that the external firewall is likely configured with a
default-deny policy, only allowing traffic for specific, intended
services, none of which were exposed to the public internet from the
scanning source. This significantly reduces the external attack
surface.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes findings from the security control review,
technical scans, and pre-existing risk data. Based on the provided
inputs, one new critical risk has been identified. No pre-existing risks
were reported.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="impact-analysis-for-risk-001">Impact Analysis
for RISK-001</h2>
<p>A compromised email account can lead to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Data Exfiltration:</strong> Attackers can access and
steal sensitive information contained in emails and
attachments.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Business Email Compromise (BEC):</strong> Attackers can
impersonate employees to authorize fraudulent wire transfers or deceive
other employees into revealing sensitive information.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lateral Movement:</strong> The compromised account can be
used to reset passwords for other corporate applications, expanding the
attacker’s foothold within the network.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reputational Damage:</strong> A public breach originating
from a compromised email account can severely damage the organization’s
reputation with clients and partners.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified
risks and improve the overall security posture of <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Access (Critical
Priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediately enable and enforce MFA for
all user accounts on the organization’s email platform (e.g., Microsoft
365, Google Workspace).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> This is the single most effective
control to prevent unauthorized access to email accounts, directly
mitigating RISK-001. It protects against password spraying, credential
stuffing, and phishing attacks.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Regular Security Control Audits (High
Priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Establish a quarterly or semi-annual
process to review security control questionnaires and validate that
policies are being enforced as intended.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> This proactive measure ensures
that security gaps, like the one identified with email MFA, are
discovered and remediated before they can be exploited.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Perform Periodic External Penetration Testing (Medium
Priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> While the initial scan showed no open
ports, a comprehensive penetration test should be conducted annually by
a third party.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> A full penetration test goes
beyond a simple port scan, actively attempting to exploit potential
misconfigurations or vulnerabilities that may not be immediately
apparent. This provides a higher level of assurance about the security
of the network perimeter.</p></li>
</ul></li>
