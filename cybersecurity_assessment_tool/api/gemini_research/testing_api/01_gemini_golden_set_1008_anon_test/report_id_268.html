<p><strong>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</strong></p>
<p>Prepared for:<br />
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Date of Report:</strong> 2026-01-30</p>
<p><strong>Generated By:</strong><br />

<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity assessment
conducted for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The evaluation
combined a technical network scan with a review of organizational
security controls and pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The primary finding is a significant disparity between the
organization’s technical and procedural security postures. The external
network scan of the target system revealed a strong configuration with
no open ports detected, which effectively minimizes the external attack
surface.</p>
<p>However, the review of security controls identified several critical
and high-risk deficiencies in administrative and policy-based
safeguards. The most severe gaps include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email
access</strong>, which exposes the organization to a high risk of
business email compromise (BEC) and account takeovers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of a formal employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP)</strong>, leading to a lack of clear guidelines for system usage
and data handling.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Complete lack of a security awareness training
program</strong>, leaving employees vulnerable to phishing and social
engineering attacks.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>While the current network perimeter appears secure, these procedural
gaps represent a significant threat to the organization’s overall
security. Immediate action is recommended to address these findings,
focusing first on implementing MFA for email services.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following details were used as the basis for this assessment. As
identity data was not provided, placeholders have been used.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Organization Name:</strong> <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Primary Email Domain:</strong>

<li><p><strong>External IP Address Assessed:</strong>
<code>[Client IP]</code></p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A review of internal security controls was conducted via a
standardized questionnaire. The responses indicate critical gaps in
foundational security practices. A summary of the responses is provided
in Table <a href="#tab:controls" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="tab:controls">1</a>. The checkmark () indicates a
positive control is in place, while the cross () indicates a control
gap.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed using Nmap to identify open
ports and services on the designated target system.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Findings:</strong> The scan confirmed that the host
is online and responsive. However, no open TCP or UDP ports were
discovered within the scanned range. All non-open ports were reported as
‘closed‘.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Analysis:</strong> This result indicates a strong network
perimeter security posture for the scanned host. By not exposing any
services to the public internet, the organization significantly reduces
its vulnerability to external network-based attacks. This is an
excellent security practice.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section correlates the findings from the security control review
and technical scan. While no pre-existing vulnerabilities were reported
and no technical vulnerabilities were found, the policy and procedural
gaps create significant organizational risks. These are detailed in
Table <a href="#tab:risks" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="tab:risks">2</a>.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the identified risks, the following prioritized
recommendations are provided to strengthen the security posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="priority-1-remediate-immediately">Priority 1: Remediate
Immediately</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Implement MFA for Email (Risk R-01):</dt>
<dd>
<p>This is the most critical action to take. Enforce MFA for all users
accessing the email system, whether through a web client or a mobile
application. This single control is highly effective at preventing
account takeovers, even if passwords are stolen.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="priority-2-remediate-within-30-60-days">Priority 2: Remediate
within 30-60 Days</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Establish a Security Awareness Training Program (Risk R-02):</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop or procure a training module for all new hires that
covers fundamental topics like phishing, password security, and data
handling.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement an annual refresher training program for all employees
to ensure their knowledge remains current.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider periodic phishing simulations to test and reinforce
employee awareness.</p></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="priority-3-remediate-within-60-90-days">Priority 3: Remediate
within 60-90 Days</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Develop and Enforce an Acceptable Use Policy (Risk R-03):</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><p>Draft a clear and concise AUP that outlines the rules for using
company networks, computers, and data.</p></li>
<li><p>Have the policy reviewed by management and/or legal
counsel.</p></li>
<li><p>Distribute the policy to all employees and require them to
formally acknowledge that they have read and understood it.</p></li>
