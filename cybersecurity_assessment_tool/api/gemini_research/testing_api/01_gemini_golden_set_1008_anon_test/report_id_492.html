<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides an assessment of the cybersecurity posture for
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The analysis is based on three
data sources: a self-reported security controls questionnaire, a
technical network scan, and a list of pre-existing risks.</p>
<p><strong>Important Note on Data Integrity:</strong> During the
analysis process, it was determined that the data feeds for the
<strong>Technical Network Scan (Input 1)</strong> and the
<strong>Current Risks (Input 3)</strong> were corrupted and could not be
parsed. Consequently, this assessment is primarily based on the
<strong>Security Controls Questionnaire (Input 2)</strong>. A new
technical scan is strongly recommended to identify network-based
vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>The questionnaire revealed several critical gaps in the
organization’s security controls. Key findings include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Endpoint Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA):</strong> User computers are not protected by MFA, creating a
significant risk of unauthorized access if credentials are
compromised.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong>
Without a formal AUP, there are no established rules for employee use of
company assets, leading to potential misuse and insider
threats.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inadequate Onboarding Security Training:</strong> New
employees do not receive security awareness training, leaving them
vulnerable to social engineering attacks from their first day.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These findings indicate a reactive rather than proactive security
stance. The recommendations in this report focus on establishing
foundational security controls to mitigate these high-priority risks and
build a stronger security culture.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following details were used as the basis for this assessment. Due
to the anonymized nature of the provided data, placeholders have been
used where necessary.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network port scan was intended to be performed against the target
IP address <code>[Target IP]</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Data Corruption Notice:</strong> The results file from the
network scan (<code>Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON</code>) was found to be
malformed or corrupted. Therefore, a technical analysis of open ports,
running services, and potential vulnerabilities could not be
completed.</p>
<p>A properly executed scan would typically identify the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Open TCP/UDP ports and their associated services.</p></li>
<li><p>Software product names and version numbers.</p></li>
<li><p>Outdated software versions with known public vulnerabilities
(CVEs).</p></li>
<li><p>Insecure service configurations (e.g., FTP, Telnet).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>It is imperative that a new network scan be conducted to
obtain this critical visibility into the organization’s external attack
surface.</strong></p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This risk assessment is based on the findings from the Security
Control Review. The pre-existing risk data

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actions are recommended to address the identified risks
and improve the overall security posture of <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Endpoint MFA (Addresses RISK-001):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Deploy a robust Multi-Factor
Authentication solution for all employee computer logins (e.g., Windows
Hello, Duo, Okta).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> <strong>Critical</strong>. This should
be the immediate priority. Start with privileged users (administrators)
and expand to all employees within the next quarter.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Drastically reduces the risk of
unauthorized access from compromised credentials.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce an Acceptable Use Policy (Addresses
RISK-002):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Draft a formal AUP that clearly defines
the rules for using company networks, devices, and data. This policy
should be reviewed by HR and legal counsel.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> High. This foundational policy should
be developed and implemented within the next 60 days.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Establishes a clear security baseline
for all employees, reduces legal liability, and provides a basis for
disciplinary action in case of violation. All employees must sign an
acknowledgement of the policy.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish a Security Onboarding Program (Addresses
RISK-003):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Create a mandatory security awareness
training module that is a required part of the new employee onboarding
process. The training should cover phishing, password security, data
handling, and the new AUP.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> High. This should be implemented as
soon as the AUP is finalized.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Ensures that new employees understand
their security responsibilities from day one, reducing their
susceptibility to common cyberattacks.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct a New Technical Network Scan:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Commission a new, comprehensive external
and internal network vulnerability scan to identify technical weaknesses
that were missed due to the corrupted data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> High.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Provides essential visibility into the
organization’s technical attack surface, allowing for the remediation of
software vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.</p></li>
</ul></li>
