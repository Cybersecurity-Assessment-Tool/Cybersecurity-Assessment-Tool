<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity assessment
conducted for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The analysis
synthesized data from an external network scan, a security controls
questionnaire, and a review of pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>A <strong>critical risk</strong> was identified: the direct exposure
of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) on the public internet at
<code>[Client IP]</code>. This configuration is a primary target for
ransomware gangs and other malicious actors, representing an immediate
and severe threat to the organization’s network integrity and data
security.</p>
<p>This technical vulnerability is significantly amplified by critical
gaps in foundational security controls. The lack of Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins means that a single
compromised password could lead to a full network breach. Furthermore,
the absence of annual security awareness training for all employees
increases the likelihood of such a credential compromise occurring
through phishing or other social engineering attacks.</p>
<p>The overall security posture is assessed as
<strong>High-Risk</strong>. Immediate remediation is required to address
the exposed RDP service. Strategic initiatives to implement
comprehensive MFA and a robust security training program are strongly
recommended to build a more resilient security foundation.</p>
<h1 id="assessment-scope-and-information">Assessment Scope and
Information</h1>
<p>This assessment focused on the external network perimeter and
internal security policies of the organization. The following details
were used as the basis for this report.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Organization Name:</strong> <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Primary Email Domain:</strong>

<li><p><strong>Target IP in Scan Data:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A review of the organization’s security controls was conducted via a
questionnaire. The responses highlight key areas of strength and
weakness in the current security policy framework. "No" answers indicate
significant gaps that increase organizational risk.</p>

</div>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-control-gaps">Analysis of Control
Gaps</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA:</strong> The absence of MFA for email and
computer logins is a critical weakness. These are the two most common
entry points for attackers who have stolen user credentials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inadequate Security Training:</strong> While new
employees receive training, the lack of an annual refresher for all
staff allows security knowledge to become outdated, making the
organization more susceptible to evolving phishing and social
engineering tactics.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed to identify open ports and
exposed services on the organization’s public-facing infrastructure.</p>
<div class="tabular">

<strong>State</strong> &amp; <strong>Service Name</strong> &amp;
<strong>Analysis</strong><br />
/tcp &amp; open &amp; <code>ms-wbt-server</code> &amp; This is the
default port for Microsoft’s Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). Exposing RDP
directly to the internet is extremely dangerous and is a common vector
for brute-force attacks and ransomware deployment.<br />

<h1 id="correlated-risk-assessment">Correlated Risk Assessment</h1>

<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Publicly Exposed RDP
Service</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Critical</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The technical scan and pre-existing risk
data confirm that RDP is open on port 3389. This allows attackers to
attempt direct remote access to the internal network. This is a
well-known and actively exploited vulnerability.</td>

Authentication</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Critical</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The questionnaire revealed a lack of MFA
for email and computer access. This directly correlates with the exposed
RDP risk; if an attacker obtains a user’s password, they can log in
without needing a second factor, gaining a foothold in the network.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Inadequate Security Awareness
Program</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>High</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The lack of annual training for all
employees makes it more likely that an attacker can successfully steal
credentials via a phishing email. This weakness serves as a potential
trigger for the other identified risks.</td>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified
risks. They are prioritized based on the severity of the risk and the
urgency of the required action.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="priority-1-immediate-actions-remediate-within-24-hours">Priority 1:
Immediate Actions (Remediate within 24 hours)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Isolate the Exposed RDP Service:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Apply a firewall rule to <strong>block
all inbound traffic to TCP port 3389</strong> on the external IP address
<code>[Client IP]</code>. This is the most critical first step.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> This action immediately removes
the direct threat of an external attacker accessing the network via
RDP.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="priority-2-short-term-actions-remediate-within-30-days">Priority 2:
Short-Term Actions (Remediate within 30 days)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement Comprehensive MFA:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Procure and enforce an MFA solution for
all user accounts. Prioritize email (e.g., Office 365, Google Workspace)
and all computer logins (local and remote).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> MFA is one of the most effective
controls for preventing account takeovers, even if passwords are
stolen.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="priority-3-foundational-improvements-implement-within-90-days">Priority
3: Foundational Improvements (Implement within 90 days)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Establish Annual Security Awareness
Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop and mandate an annual security
awareness training program for all employees, covering topics like
phishing, password hygiene, and acceptable use.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> A well-trained workforce is a
critical layer of defense, reducing the "human factor" risk.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Deploy a Secure Remote Access Solution:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> For any legitimate need for remote
access, replace direct RDP exposure with a secure, modern solution like
a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or a Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA)
platform. All such solutions must be protected with MFA.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> This provides a secure,
encrypted, and authenticated channel for remote work, adhering to the
principle of least privilege.</p></li>
