<p><strong>Cybersecurity Posture Assessment Report</strong><br />
For<br />
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong><br />
<strong>Date of Report:</strong> 2026-01-30<br />
<strong>Prepared by:</strong> Cybersecurity Analysis Division<br />
</p>
</div>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">1. Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the cybersecurity
posture for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on a review of
organizational security controls, an external network scan, and
pre-existing risk data.</p>
<p>The assessment identified several positive security controls,
including the mandatory use of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
email and sensitive data systems, as well as a robust security awareness
training program for all employees. These measures significantly
strengthen the organization’s defense against common cyber threats like
phishing and account compromise.</p>
<p>However, two critical gaps were identified in the organization’s
policies and technical controls:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins:</strong> The absence of
MFA on employee workstations presents a high risk, as a single
compromised password could grant an attacker direct access to the
internal network.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong>
Without a formal AUP, there is no clear guidance for employees on the
secure and appropriate use of company assets, increasing the risk of
insider threats and unintentional data breaches.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The technical network scan of the target IP address
<code>[Target IP]</code> did not identify any open ports. Notably, port
80, which was associated with a pre-existing risk ("Unencrypted Web
Server"), was found to be closed. This is a positive finding and
suggests that the previously identified risk may have been
remediated.</p>
<p>This report outlines these findings in detail and provides actionable
recommendations to mitigate the identified risks and enhance the overall
security posture.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="organizational-information">2. Organizational
Information</h1>
<p>This assessment was conducted for the following entity:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Organization Name:</strong> <strong>[Organization

security controls questionnaire. "No" answers indicate a deviation from
security best practices and represent potential areas of risk.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-gaps">Analysis of Gaps</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA for Computers:</strong> The lack of MFA for
workstation logins is a critical vulnerability. If an employee’s
password is stolen, an attacker could potentially log in to their
machine and gain a foothold within the internal network.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> An AUP is a
foundational policy that sets expectations for employee behavior when
using company technology. Its absence creates ambiguity and increases
the risk of misuse of assets and data.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">4. Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed using Nmap against the
designated target IP address.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP:</strong> <code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Data not provided in scan
results.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Summary of Findings:</strong> The scan completed
successfully and found the host to be online. However, <strong>no open
ports were discovered</strong>. All scanned ports, including common
ports like 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS), were reported as
’closed’.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="correlation-with-existing-risks">Correlation
with Existing Risks</h2>
<p>The scan results contradict a pre-existing risk titled "Unencrypted
Web Server," which stated that Port 80 was open. The current scan
indicates that Port 80 is closed, suggesting this vulnerability has been
successfully remediated or was a false positive in a previous
assessment.</p>

Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>The following table synthesizes findings from the security
questionnaire, technical scan, and pre-existing risk data into a

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">6. Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actions are recommended to address the identified risks
and improve the security posture of <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong>.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="recommendation-1-implement-mfa-for-workstation-logins-high-priority">Recommendation
1: Implement MFA for Workstation Logins (High Priority)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Deploy a mandatory Multi-Factor
Authentication solution for all employee computer and server
logins.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> This will prevent unauthorized
access even if user credentials are stolen, significantly reducing the
risk of lateral movement and ransomware attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Examples:</strong> Solutions include Windows Hello for
Business, Duo Security, or other third-party identity providers that
integrate with your operating systems.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="recommendation-2-develop-and-enforce-an-acceptable-use-policy-high-priority">Recommendation
2: Develop and Enforce an Acceptable Use Policy (High Priority)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Draft, approve, and distribute a formal
Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) to all employees. Require employees to read
and acknowledge the policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> An AUP establishes clear rules
for using company IT assets, reduces the risk of misuse, and provides a
basis for disciplinary action in case of violations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Resources:</strong> Templates are available from
organizations like SANS (<a
href="https://www.sans.org/information-security-policy/"
class="uri">https://www.sans.org/information-security-policy/</a>).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="recommendation-3-verify-and-close-historical-risk-low-priority">Recommendation
3: Verify and Close Historical Risk (Low Priority)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Formally document that the "Unencrypted
Web Server" risk related to port 80 has been remediated, based on the
recent network scan results.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> Maintaining an accurate risk
register is crucial for focusing resources on current, active threats.
This action ensures the risk register reflects the current state of the
network.</p></li>
