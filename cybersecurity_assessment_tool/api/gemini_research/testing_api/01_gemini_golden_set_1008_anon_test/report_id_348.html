<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a cybersecurity posture assessment for . The
analysis is primarily based on a security controls questionnaire, as the
provided network scan data and pre-existing risk logs were found to be
corrupted and could not be processed. This lack of technical data
represents a significant visibility gap that must be addressed.</p>
<p>Based on the available information, the organization’s current
security posture is assessed as <strong>High-Risk</strong>. Several
critical security controls are not implemented, exposing the
organization to significant threats, including account compromise, data
breaches, and social engineering attacks.</p>
<p>Key findings from the security questionnaire include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Critical MFA Gaps:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) is not enforced for accessing email or sensitive data systems.
This is a critical vulnerability that dramatically increases the risk of
unauthorized access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Governance:</strong> The organization lacks a
formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), leading to ambiguity in
security responsibilities and acceptable user behavior.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Incomplete Training Program:</strong> While new employees
receive security training, there is no mandatory annual training for all
staff, allowing security knowledge to degrade over time and increasing
susceptibility to phishing and other attacks.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Immediate remediation is required to address these deficiencies.
Recommendations focus on implementing foundational security controls to
mitigate the most severe risks identified. A full technical assessment
is also urgently needed once data collection issues are resolved.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-control-gaps">Analysis of Control Gaps</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA on Email and Sensitive Systems:</strong> The absence
of MFA on email and sensitive data systems is a critical weakness. Email
is a primary target for phishing attacks, and a compromised account can
lead to widespread system access and data exfiltration.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> Without an AUP,
employees may not understand their security responsibilities or the
rules for handling company data and using IT resources. This policy is a
foundational element of security governance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Annual Security Training:</strong> Security is a
constantly evolving field. A one-time training for new hires is
insufficient. Regular, annual training ensures that all employees remain
aware of current threats and organizational policies.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>The input file containing the network scan results for the target was
found to be <strong>corrupted or incomplete</strong>. Consequently, no
analysis of open ports, running services, or potential software
vulnerabilities could be performed.</p>
<p>This represents a critical gap in visibility into the organization’s
external attack surface. Without this data, it is impossible to identify
unpatched systems, insecure service configurations, or other technical
vulnerabilities that could be exploited by an attacker.</p>
<h1 id="pre-existing-risk-data-review">Pre-existing Risk Data
Review</h1>
<p>The input file containing data on current and historical risks was
also found to be <strong>corrupted or incomplete</strong>. As a result,
it was not possible to correlate findings from this assessment with
previously identified vulnerabilities. A well-maintained risk register
is essential for tracking remediation efforts and understanding the
organization’s risk landscape over time.</p>

<p>The following table summarizes the key risks identified during this
assessment, based on the available questionnaire data. The severity is

<h2 id="immediate-actions-critical-priority">Immediate Actions (Critical
Priority)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email:</strong> Immediately enforce MFA
for all user access to the email system (e.g., Microsoft 365, Google
Workspace).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Systems:</strong> Identify
all systems containing sensitive, confidential, or regulated data and
enforce MFA for all user access without exception.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Resolve Data Ingestion Issues:</strong> Investigate the
cause of the data corruption for the network scan and risk register

successfully completed to identify technical vulnerabilities.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="high-priority-actions">High Priority Actions</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an AUP:</strong> Create a formal
Acceptable Use Policy that clearly defines the rules and
responsibilities for all employees when using company IT resources. This
policy should be reviewed by legal counsel and communicated to all
staff.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Annual Security Training:</strong> Implement a
mandatory security awareness training program for all employees to be
completed at least once per year. The training should cover current
threats such as phishing, ransomware, and secure data handling.</p></li>
