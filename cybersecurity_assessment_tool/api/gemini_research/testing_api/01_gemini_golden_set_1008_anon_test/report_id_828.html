<h1 id="executive-overview">Executive Overview</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment conducted for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The
primary goal of this assessment was to identify security gaps, evaluate
existing controls, and provide actionable recommendations to enhance the
organization’s overall security posture.</p>
<p>The analysis revealed several critical and high-risk security gaps
based on a review of organizational security controls. Key findings
include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Critical Risk - Lack of MFA on Email:</strong> The
absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on employee email accounts
presents a significant and immediate risk of account compromise and
business email compromise (BEC) attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>High Risk - Inadequate Security Awareness
Training:</strong> The organization lacks a formal security awareness
training program for new and existing employees. This deficiency
increases susceptibility to phishing, social engineering, and other
human-targeted cyber threats.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Data Limitations:</strong> It is important to note that the
external network scan data and the list of pre-existing vulnerabilities
were found to be corrupted or were otherwise unavailable for this
assessment. Consequently, this report’s findings are based primarily on
the analysis of the provided organizational questionnaire. A full
technical vulnerability assessment could not be completed.</p>
<p>Recommendations have been prioritized to address the most severe
risks first.</p>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>An assessment of administrative and technical security controls was
performed based on a self-reported questionnaire. The results are
summarized in Table 1. Responses marked with a  indicate a deviation
from security best practices and represent a potential gap in the
organization’s defenses.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-gaps">Analysis of Gaps</h2>
<p>The review identified three significant control gaps:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>MFA for Email:</strong> Email is a primary target for
attackers. The lack of MFA makes it highly vulnerable to credential
stuffing and phishing attacks, which can lead to data breaches and
financial loss.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>New Employee Training:</strong> New hires are often
unfamiliar with corporate policies and are prime targets for social
engineering. The absence of onboarding security training is a major
oversight.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Annual Employee Training:</strong> The threat landscape
evolves continuously. Without regular, recurring training, employees’
ability to recognize and respond to new threats diminishes over
time.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was scheduled for the target IP address
<code>[Target IP]</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Status: Incomplete.</strong> The data returned from the
network scanning tool was found to be corrupted and could not be parsed.
Therefore, no analysis of open ports, running services, or potential
vulnerabilities from the external network perspective could be
performed. It is recommended that a new scan be scheduled to obtain this
critical visibility.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This risk assessment is based on the gaps identified in the Security
Control Review (Section 3). Due to data limitations, it does not include
risks from technical scans or previously tracked vulnerabilities. The
identified risks are summarized in Table 2.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified
risks and strengthen the security posture of <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong>.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="priority-1-remediate-critical-risks">Priority
1: Remediate Critical Risks</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Recommendation 1.1:</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>Immediately Enforce MFA for All Email Accounts.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Enable and enforce MFA across the entire
email environment (e.g., Microsoft 365, Google Workspace). All user
accounts, including administrative and service accounts where possible,
must be covered.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> This is the single most effective
control to prevent unauthorized account access and will drastically
reduce the likelihood of a successful business email compromise
attack.</p></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="priority-2-remediate-high-risks">Priority 2:
Remediate High Risks</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Recommendation 2.1:</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>Establish a Comprehensive Security Awareness
Program.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop and implement a mandatory
security awareness training program. This program must include:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>An initial training module for all new hires during their
onboarding process.</p></li>
<li><p>An annual refresher course for all employees covering topics like
phishing, password security, and acceptable use.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> A well-trained workforce serves as a
human firewall, reducing the organization’s susceptibility to common
cyberattacks and fostering a culture of security.</p></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="priority-3-improve-security-visibility">Priority 3: Improve Security
Visibility</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Recommendation 3.1:</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>Reschedule Technical Security Assessments.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Coordinate with the security team to
perform a new external network vulnerability scan. Additionally, provide
a valid data export of any internally tracked risks or
vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Completing these assessments will
provide necessary visibility into the technical attack surface, allowing
for a more comprehensive understanding of the organization’s risk
profile.</p></li>
