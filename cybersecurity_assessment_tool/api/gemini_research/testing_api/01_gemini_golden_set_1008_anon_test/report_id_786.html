<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive assessment of the cybersecurity
posture for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on an analysis
of organizational security controls, a technical network scan, and a
review of pre-existing risk data. The assessment was conducted on
2026-01-31.</p>
<p>The analysis revealed several critical and high-risk security gaps
originating from organizational policies and procedures. Most notably,
the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and
access to sensitive data systems presents a significant risk of
unauthorized access and potential data breach. Furthermore, the absence
of a formal Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and mandatory annual security
awareness training for all employees weakens the organization’s human
firewall, leaving it more susceptible to social engineering and insider
threats.</p>
<p>On a positive note, the technical network scan of the designated
target IP address did not identify any open ports. This is a strong
indicator of a well-configured perimeter firewall. Interestingly, this
finding contradicts a pre-existing risk item concerning an "Unencrypted
Web Server" on port 80. This suggests that the previously identified
risk may have been successfully remediated.</p>
<p>Key recommendations focus on immediate implementation of MFA across
all critical systems, development of foundational security policies, and
establishment of a recurring security training program to address the
identified deficiencies and bolster the organization’s overall defensive
capabilities.</p>

<p>The findings indicate a robust control for email access but highlight
critical deficiencies in endpoint security, access control for sensitive
data, and foundational employee security governance.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed to identify externally accessible
services and potential vulnerabilities.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP:</strong> <code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not provided in scan data; report
generated 2026-01-31.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="findings">Findings</h2>
<p>The scan confirmed that the host at <code>[Target IP]</code> is
online and responsive.</p>
<p><strong>No open TCP ports were discovered during this
assessment.</strong> Port 80 (HTTP), which was specifically checked, was
found to be in a <strong>‘closed‘</strong> state. This is a positive
security finding, indicating a well-configured firewall or the absence
of listening services on the scanned ports. This result directly
contradicts the pre-existing risk detailed in Section 5.</p>

</div>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the risk assessment, the following actions are recommended
to improve the organization’s cybersecurity posture. Recommendations are
prioritized by severity.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>[Critical] Implement MFA for Sensitive Data
Systems:</strong> Immediately deploy a robust MFA solution for all
applications and systems identified as containing or providing access to
sensitive organizational or customer data. This is the highest priority
action to prevent a significant data breach.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>[High] Enforce MFA for Endpoint Logins:</strong> Require
MFA for all employee computer logins (e.g., Windows, macOS). This
drastically reduces the risk of an attacker gaining a foothold in the
network via compromised credentials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>[High] Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Draft, approve, and disseminate a formal AUP that
clearly defines the rules for using company technology and data. All
employees should be required to read and acknowledge the
policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>[High] Establish Annual Security Awareness
Training:</strong> Institute a mandatory security awareness training
program for all employees to be completed at least once per year. This
program should cover current threats such as phishing, ransomware, and
social engineering.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>[Medium] Validate and Update Risk Register:</strong>
Conduct a review of the pre-existing risk, "Unencrypted Web Server," to
formally confirm if it has been remediated as the recent scan suggests.
Update the internal risk register to accurately reflect the current
state of the control.</p></li>
