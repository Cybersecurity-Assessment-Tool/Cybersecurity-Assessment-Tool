<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a cybersecurity posture assessment for
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, conducted on 2026-01-31. The
analysis is based on a combination of self-reported organizational
security controls, an external network vulnerability scan, and a review
of pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The assessment identified two significant areas of concern requiring
immediate attention. The most critical finding is the absence of
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access, which exposes the
organization to a high risk of Business Email Compromise (BEC) and
unauthorized account access. A second high-risk finding is the lack of
mandatory, annual security awareness training for all employees, which
increases susceptibility to phishing and other social engineering
attacks.</p>
<p>On a positive note, the external network scan of the target system
<code>[Client IP]</code> did not identify any open ports or exposed
services. This suggests a well-configured network perimeter for the
scanned asset. No pre-existing vulnerabilities were reported for
inclusion in this assessment.</p>
<p>Overall, while the organization has implemented some foundational
security controls, the identified gaps in authentication and employee
training present a substantial risk. We strongly recommend prioritizing
the remediation steps outlined in Section 6 to mitigate these threats
and improve the organization’s overall security posture.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-control-gaps">Analysis of Control
Gaps</h2>
<p>Two significant control gaps were identified from the
questionnaire:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>No MFA for Email:</strong> This is a critical security
weakness. Email accounts are primary targets for attackers seeking to
gain an initial foothold, conduct phishing campaigns, or execute
Business Email Compromise (BEC) attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Annual Security Awareness Training:</strong> While
training for new hires is in place, the lack of ongoing, annual training
for all staff means that cybersecurity knowledge is not reinforced. The
threat landscape evolves continuously, and so must employee
awareness.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed to identify any exposed
services or potential vulnerabilities on the public-facing
infrastructure.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> [Scan Date]</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="findings">Findings</h2>
<p>The network scan performed on the target IP address revealed
<strong>no open ports</strong>. This indicates a strong network
perimeter security posture for the scanned host, as no services were
found to be exposed to the public internet. This significantly reduces
the external attack surface of the asset.</p>
<h1 id="consolidated-risk-assessment">Consolidated Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section consolidates findings from the security control review,
technical scan, and pre-existing risk data. Each identified risk is
assigned a severity level to aid in prioritization.</p>

Name</strong> &amp; <strong>Overview</strong> &amp;
<strong>Severity</strong><br />
Lack of MFA on Email &amp; The absence of MFA on email accounts allows
for takeover with a single compromised password, enabling data breaches
and BEC. &amp; <strong>Critical</strong><br />
Lack of Annual Security Training &amp; Without regular training,
employees are more likely to fall victim to phishing and social
engineering, leading to security incidents. &amp;

</div>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actions are recommended to address the identified
risks. Recommendations are prioritized based on the severity of the
corresponding risk.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="recommendation-1-implement-mfa-for-email-access-critical">Recommendation
1: Implement MFA for Email Access (Critical)</h2>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Enforce mandatory Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for all user access to the organization’s email
system. This is the single most effective control to prevent
unauthorized account access.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action 1:</strong> Select and configure an MFA solution
compatible with your email provider (e.g., Microsoft Authenticator,
Google Authenticator, hardware tokens).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action 2:</strong> Develop a phased rollout plan,
starting with IT staff and executives, then extending to all
employees.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action 3:</strong> Provide clear instructions and support
to all users during the transition to minimize disruption.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="recommendation-2-establish-annual-security-awareness-training-high">Recommendation
2: Establish Annual Security Awareness Training (High)</h2>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Develop and implement a mandatory
security awareness training program that all employees must complete at
least once per year.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action 1:</strong> Procure or create training content
that covers modern threats, including phishing, ransomware, password
security, and social engineering.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action 2:</strong> Implement a system to track training
completion for all employees to ensure compliance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action 3:</strong> Supplement annual training with
periodic phishing simulation campaigns to test and reinforce employee
knowledge in a practical setting.</p></li>
