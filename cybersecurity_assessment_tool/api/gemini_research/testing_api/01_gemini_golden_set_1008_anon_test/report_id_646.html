<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The evaluation
combined a review of organizational security controls via a
questionnaire, an external network vulnerability scan, and an analysis
of pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The assessment identified several critical and high-risk gaps in the
organization’s administrative and technical controls. While the external
network scan of the target IP address <code>[Client IP]</code> did not
reveal any exposed services—a positive indicator of strong perimeter
defense—this does not mitigate the significant internal risks
discovered.</p>
<p>Key findings include a lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
computer and sensitive data system access, which exposes the
organization to significant risk from compromised credentials.
Furthermore, the complete absence of an employee security awareness
training program and an acceptable use policy creates a high
susceptibility to social engineering, phishing attacks, and insider
threats.</p>
<p>Immediate remediation is recommended to address these fundamental
security control deficiencies. Prioritizing the implementation of MFA
and establishing a formal security awareness program are crucial first
steps to improving the organization’s overall security posture.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following information was used as the basis for this assessment.

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-control-gaps">Analysis of Control
Gaps</h2>
<p>The questionnaire reveals several significant weaknesses in the
organization’s security posture. The "No" responses () highlight areas
requiring immediate attention:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA:</strong> While MFA is commendably enforced
for email, its absence on computer logins and sensitive data systems is
a critical vulnerability. If an employee’s credentials are stolen, an
attacker could gain direct access to endpoints and critical data without
any secondary challenge.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of Security Policies and Training:</strong> The
lack of an acceptable use policy means there are no formal guidelines
for employees on the secure use of company assets. Compounded by the
absence of any security awareness training, this leaves the organization
highly vulnerable to human error, phishing, and social engineering
attacks. Employees are not equipped to recognize or respond to common
cyber threats.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was conducted against the target IP address
provided.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not specified in scan data.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="findings">Findings</h2>
<p>The scan results indicate that <strong>no open ports or exposed
services were detected</strong> on the target system.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="interpretation">Interpretation</h2>
<p>This finding suggests that the target host is likely protected by a
well-configured firewall that blocks unsolicited inbound traffic from
the internet. While this is a positive sign of a strong network
perimeter, it is important to note that this result does not provide
insight into the security of internal systems or protect against threats
that bypass the perimeter, such as phishing attacks or malware
introduced via other vectors.</p>

</div>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the risks identified in Section 5, the following actions are
recommended to strengthen the organization’s cybersecurity posture.
Recommendations are prioritized by severity.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Comprehensive MFA (RISK-001,
RISK-002):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Enforce MFA for all user accounts for
logging into company computers (endpoints) and accessing all systems
containing sensitive or critical data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Drastically reduces the risk of
unauthorized access from compromised credentials. This is the single
most effective control to mitigate the identified critical
risks.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish a Security Awareness Program
(RISK-003):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop and implement a mandatory
security awareness training program. This program should be required for
all new hires during onboarding and for all employees on an annual
basis. Topics should include phishing identification, password hygiene,
and incident reporting.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Empowers employees to act as a human
firewall, reducing the likelihood of successful phishing and social
engineering attacks.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce an Acceptable Use Policy
(RISK-004):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Create a formal AUP that clearly defines
the rules and responsibilities for all users of the organization’s IT
systems. This policy should be distributed to all employees, who must
formally acknowledge their understanding and agreement.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Establishes a clear baseline for secure
behavior, reduces insider risk, and provides a basis for disciplinary
action in case of policy violations.</p></li>
</ul></li>
