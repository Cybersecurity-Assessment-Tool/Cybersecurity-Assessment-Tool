<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">1. Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the cybersecurity
posture for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The assessment is
based on a correlation of external network scan data, an internal
security controls questionnaire, and a review of pre-existing risk
documentation.</p>
<p>The analysis reveals a mixed security posture. The organization has
successfully implemented several critical controls, including
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across email, computer logins, and
sensitive data systems. However, two significant risks have been
identified that require immediate attention:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Critical Technical Vulnerability:</strong> An external
network scan confirmed that a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) service
(port 3389) is publicly exposed on the network perimeter at
<code>[Client IP]</code>. This finding aligns with a known high-severity
risk and presents an immediate and substantial threat of unauthorized
access, potentially leading to a ransomware attack or complete system
compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>High-Risk Procedural Gap:</strong> The security controls
review identified that the organization does not conduct annual security
awareness training for all employees. This gap increases the
organization’s susceptibility to social engineering and phishing
attacks, as employee knowledge of current threats is not regularly
reinforced.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This report details these findings and provides prioritized,
actionable recommendations to mitigate the identified risks and
strengthen the overall security posture of <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong>.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-control-gaps">Analysis of Control
Gaps</h2>
<p>The review indicates a significant gap in the organization’s security
training program. While new employees receive initial training, the lack
of a mandatory annual refresher course for <em>all</em> staff is a
high-risk oversight. The threat landscape evolves rapidly, and without
continuous education, employees are more likely to fall victim to modern
phishing and social engineering tactics. This gap undermines the
effectiveness of technical controls.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of
Technical Findings</h2>
<p>The scan identified that TCP port 3389 is open to the public
internet. This port is used for Microsoft’s Remote Desktop Protocol
(RDP). Publicly exposed RDP is a well-known and highly targeted attack
vector used by malicious actors, including ransomware gangs, to gain
initial access to a network. This finding represents a critical
vulnerability that directly exposes the organization to a high risk of
compromise. This technical finding validates the pre-existing risk
documented in the organization’s risk register.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">6. Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified
risks. They are prioritized based on severity and potential impact.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="priority-1-remediate-critical-rdp-exposure-immediate">Priority 1:
Remediate Critical RDP Exposure (Immediate)</h2>
<p>This vulnerability must be addressed immediately to prevent a
potential network compromise.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Action (Containment):</strong> Implement a
firewall rule to <strong>block all inbound traffic</strong> to TCP port
3389 on the external interface of <code>[Client IP]</code>. This will
immediately remove the public exposure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Long-Term Solution (Secure Access):</strong> For
necessary remote administration, implement a Virtual Private Network
(VPN) solution. Access to the internal network, including RDP services,
should only be permitted through the VPN, which must be configured with
strong encryption and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="priority-2-implement-annual-security-training-high">Priority 2:
Implement Annual Security Training (High)</h2>
<p>This procedural gap should be closed to build a more resilient human
firewall.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Procure and implement a security
awareness training platform or service.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Mandate that all employees,
including management and executives, complete a security awareness
training module at least once per year. This training should cover
modern threats such as phishing, business email compromise, password
security, and safe browsing habits. Track completion to ensure 100%
compliance.</p></li>
