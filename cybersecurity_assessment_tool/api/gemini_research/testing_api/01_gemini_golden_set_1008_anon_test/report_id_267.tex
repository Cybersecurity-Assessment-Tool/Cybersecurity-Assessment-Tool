% --- Section 1: Executive Summary ---
\section{Executive Summary}
This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity assessment for \textbf{[Organization Name]}, based on an analysis of network scan data, organizational security controls, and pre-existing risk information. The assessment reveals several critical and high-risk vulnerabilities that require immediate attention to mitigate the threat of unauthorized access, data breach, and service disruption.

The overall security posture is currently considered \textbf{High-Risk}.

Key findings include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Critical - Publicly Exposed Database:} A MySQL database (version 5.7.33) is directly exposed to the internet. This version reached its End-of-Life (EOL) in October 2023 and no longer receives security updates, making it an easy target for attackers.
    \item \textbf{Critical - Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):} MFA is not enforced for accessing employee email or for logging into company computers. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing or credential theft.
    \item \textbf{High - Insufficient Employee Onboarding:} New employees do not receive mandatory security awareness training, creating a window of vulnerability where they are more susceptible to social engineering and policy violations.
\end{itemize}

This report outlines these findings in detail and provides a prioritized list of actionable recommendations to strengthen the organization's defenses and reduce its attack surface.

% --- Section 2: Organizational Information ---
\section{Organizational Information}
This assessment is based on data provided by the client. The following key identifiers are used throughout this report.

\begin{tabular}{@{}ll}
    \toprule
    \textbf{Attribute} & \textbf{Value} \\
    \midrule
    Organization Name & \textbf{[Organization Name]} \\
    Primary Domain & \texttt{[Domain]} \\
    Scanned External IP & \texttt{[Client IP]} \\
    \bottomrule
\end{tabular}

% --- Section 3: Security Control Review ---
\section{Security Control Review}
A review of the organization's security policies and procedures was conducted via a questionnaire. The responses indicate significant gaps in fundamental security controls, particularly concerning identity and access management and employee training.

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\caption{Security Controls Questionnaire Results}
\begin{tabular}{@{}p{0.8\linewidth}c@{}}
    \toprule
    \textbf{Question / Control} & \textbf{Status} \\
    \midrule
    Do you require MFA to access email? & \no \\
    Do you require MFA to log into computers? & \no \\
    Do you require MFA to access sensitive data systems? & \yes \\
    Does your organization have an employee acceptable use policy? & \yes \\
    Does your organization do security awareness training for new employees? & \no \\
    Does your organization do security awareness training for all employees at least once per year? & \yes \\
    \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The absence of MFA for email and computer access is a critical weakness. While MFA is enabled for other sensitive systems, a compromise of an email account or workstation could serve as a pivot point for an attacker to gain further access.

% --- Section 4: Technical Scan Results ---
\section{Technical Scan Results}
An external network scan was performed to identify open ports and exposed services on the organization's public-facing infrastructure.

\subsection{Scan Target}
The scan was performed against the following target:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{IP Address:} \texttt{[Target IP]}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Open Ports and Services}
The scan identified one open port, which presents a significant security risk.

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\caption{Discovered Open Ports}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lllll@{}}
    \toprule
    \textbf{Port} & \textbf{State} & \textbf{Service} & \textbf{Product} & \textbf{Version} \\
    \midrule
    3306/tcp & open & mysql & MySQL & 5.7.33 \\
    \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Technical Analysis}
The discovery of an open MySQL port (\texttt{3306}) is a critical finding. Databases should not be directly accessible from the public internet, as this exposes them to brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, and exploitation of vulnerabilities.

Furthermore, the detected version, \textbf{MySQL 5.7.33}, is an End-of-Life (EOL) product. Its official support and security patch cycle ended in October 2023. Running EOL software with known vulnerabilities on an internet-facing system is a severe security risk that could lead to a full database compromise. This finding directly correlates with the "Database Exposure" risk identified in Input 3.

% --- Section 5: Synthesized Risk Assessment ---
\section{Synthesized Risk Assessment}
By correlating the security control gaps, technical scan results, and pre-existing risk data, we have compiled the following summary of the most pressing risks facing the organization.

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\caption{Summary of Key Risks}
\begin{tabular}{@{}p{0.2\linewidth}p{0.15\linewidth}p{0.55\linewidth}@{}}
    \toprule
    \textbf{Risk Name} & \textbf{Severity} & \textbf{Description} \\
    \midrule
    \textbf{Exposed \& Outdated Database} & \textbf{Critical} & A MySQL database running an EOL version (5.7.33) is publicly accessible. This invites automated attacks and exploitation of unpatched vulnerabilities, potentially leading to a complete data breach. \\
    \addlinespace
    \textbf{Insufficient Access Controls} & \textbf{Critical} & The lack of MFA on core systems (email, workstations) makes the organization highly vulnerable to account takeovers via phishing or credential theft. A single compromised password could grant an attacker significant access. \\
    \addlinespace
    \textbf{Inadequate Employee Onboarding} & \textbf{High} & New employees are not provided with security awareness training, making them a prime target for social engineering attacks. This gap undermines the effectiveness of the annual training program. \\
    \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

% --- Section 6: Recommendations ---
\section{Recommendations}
The following prioritized recommendations are provided to address the identified risks.

\subsection{Immediate Actions (To Be Completed within 72 Hours)}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Firewall Database Port:} Immediately implement strict firewall rules to block all public internet access to TCP port \texttt{3306} on \texttt{[Target IP]}. Access should only be permitted from trusted internal IP addresses or via a secure VPN.
    \item \textbf{Enforce MFA on Critical Systems:} Enable and enforce MFA for all users on email accounts (e.g., Office 365, Google Workspace) and for all computer/endpoint logins.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Short-Term Actions (To Be Completed within 30-60 Days)}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Upgrade EOL Database:} Plan and execute the migration of the MySQL 5.7.33 database to a fully supported version (e.g., MySQL 8.x). This is crucial for receiving future security patches.
    \item \textbf{Implement New Hire Training:} Integrate mandatory security awareness training into the new employee onboarding process. This training should occur before a new hire is granted access to sensitive systems.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Long-Term Strategic Actions (To Be Completed within 6-12 Months)}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Establish Secure Database Access:} Implement a long-term solution for database access, such as requiring all administrators and applications to connect through a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or a bastion host.
    \item \textbf{Develop a Vulnerability Management Program:} Institute a formal program for regularly scanning internal and external assets, identifying vulnerabilities, and tracking remediation efforts to prevent future instances of EOL software exposure.
\end{enumerate}
