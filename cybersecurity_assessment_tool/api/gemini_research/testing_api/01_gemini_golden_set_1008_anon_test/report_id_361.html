<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment conducted on November 22, 2025. The assessment combined an
external network scan, a review of internal security controls via a
questionnaire, and an analysis of pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The overall security posture of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>
requires immediate attention. The assessment identified several critical
and high-risk vulnerabilities that expose the organization to
significant threats, including unauthorized data access, system
compromise, and business disruption.</p>
<p><strong>Key Findings Include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Critical Control Gap:</strong> Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) is not enforced for accessing sensitive data
systems. This represents a severe weakness in the organization’s
defense-in-depth strategy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Significant External Exposure:</strong> The public-facing
web server is running an outdated version of Nginx (1.18.0), which has
multiple known vulnerabilities. This poses a high risk of external
compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Foundational Policy Gaps:</strong> The organization lacks
a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy and does not conduct mandatory
annual security awareness training for all staff. These gaps increase
the risk of insider threats and successful social engineering
attacks.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This report provides a detailed breakdown of these findings and
offers prioritized, actionable recommendations to mitigate the
identified risks and strengthen the organization’s overall security
posture. We strongly advise that the recommendations in Section 6 be
addressed with urgency.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-control-gaps">Analysis of Control Gaps</h2>
<p>The questionnaire revealed three significant control gaps:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>No MFA for Sensitive Systems:</strong> The absence of MFA
on systems containing sensitive data is a critical vulnerability. Should
an attacker compromise a user’s credentials, they would have direct
access to the organization’s most valuable information.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> Without a formal
AUP, there are no clear guidelines for employees regarding the
acceptable use of company assets. This can lead to unintentional
security incidents and creates ambiguity in enforcing security
standards.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Annual Security Training:</strong> While new employees
receive training, the lack of an annual refresher for all staff means
that security knowledge can become outdated. This increases
susceptibility to evolving threats like phishing and other social
engineering tactics.</p></li>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed on <strong>November 22,

<h2 id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of Technical
Findings</h2>
<p>The scan identified a single service, HTTPS, running on port 443.
This service is provided by an <strong>Nginx web server, version
1.18.0</strong>.</p>
<p>This version was released in April 2020 and is now considered
outdated. It is known to be affected by several publicly disclosed
vulnerabilities, including but not limited to CVE-2021-23017. Running
outdated software on a public-facing server presents a high risk of
compromise, as attackers can exploit these known flaws to gain
unauthorized access to the server and potentially pivot to the internal
network.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the consolidated risk assessment, we provide the following
prioritized recommendations to mitigate the identified vulnerabilities
and improve the overall security posture of <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>[Critical] Implement MFA on Sensitive Systems:</strong>
Immediately deploy a robust Multi-Factor Authentication solution for all
access to systems classified as containing sensitive or critical data.
This is the highest priority action to prevent unauthorized data
access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>[High] Upgrade Public-Facing Web Server:</strong> Plan
and execute an upgrade of the Nginx server from version 1.18.0 to the
latest stable version recommended by the vendor. This will patch known
vulnerabilities and reduce the external attack surface. A continuous
patch management program should be implemented.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>[High] Develop and Enforce an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Draft a comprehensive AUP that clearly defines the rules
and responsibilities for all employees when using company technology and
data. This policy should be formally communicated to all staff and
acknowledged in writing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>[High] Establish an Annual Security Awareness
Program:</strong> Implement a mandatory security awareness training
program for all employees to be completed at least once per year. The
training should cover current threats such as phishing, malware, and
proper data handling procedures.</p></li>
