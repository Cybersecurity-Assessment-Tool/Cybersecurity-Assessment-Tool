<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The assessment
incorporated a review of organizational security controls, an external
network vulnerability scan, and an analysis of pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The key findings indicate a mixed security posture. While the
organization has implemented some positive security controls, such as
requiring Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer and sensitive
system access, critical gaps were identified that expose the
organization to significant risk.</p>
<p>The most severe risks stem from procedural and policy-based
deficiencies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Critical Risk:</strong> The absence of mandatory MFA for
email access. This represents a primary vulnerability, as email accounts
are high-value targets for attackers aiming to conduct phishing,
business email compromise (BEC), and account takeover attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>High Risk:</strong> A complete lack of a security
awareness training program for both new and existing employees. This
significantly increases the organization’s susceptibility to social
engineering attacks, which are a leading cause of security
breaches.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>On a technical level, the external network scan of the target IP
address (<code>[Target IP]</code>) did not reveal any open ports or
exposed services. This suggests a strong network perimeter configuration
for the asset under test. However, this positive finding does not
mitigate the severe organizational risks identified.</p>
<p>This report concludes with actionable recommendations to address each
identified risk, prioritizing the immediate implementation of MFA for
email and the development of a comprehensive security awareness training
program.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>This section provides the details of the organization as understood
for this assessment. The data has been anonymized as per the engagement
requirements.</p>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>The following table summarizes the organization’s responses to a
security controls questionnaire. A checkmark () indicates a positive
control is in place, while a cross () indicates a control gap that
introduces risk.</p>

<p>The identified gaps in email security and employee training are the
primary sources of risk discovered during this assessment.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network vulnerability scan was conducted against the
designated target system to identify potential weaknesses visible from
the public internet.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Type:</strong> External Port Scan (TCP/UDP)</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Findings:</strong> The scan completed successfully and
<strong>did not identify any open ports or exposed services</strong> on
the target system. This is a positive security finding, indicating that
the network firewall and perimeter security controls are effectively
configured to prevent unauthorized external access to this specific
asset.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes findings from the security control review
and technical scan. As no pre-existing vulnerabilities were reported and
no technical vulnerabilities were discovered, the following risks are
derived directly from the identified organizational control gaps.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified
risks and improve the overall security posture of <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="risk-001-implement-mfa-for-email-critical">RISK-001: Implement
MFA for Email (Critical)</h2>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediately enforce mandatory Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for all user accounts, including administrative,
service, and standard user accounts, across the organization’s email
platform (e.g., Microsoft 365, Google Workspace).</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> MFA is one of the most effective
controls to prevent account takeovers. Even if a user’s password is
stolen, MFA prevents the attacker from accessing the account without the
second factor (e.g., an authenticator app, hardware token, or SMS
code).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> Immediate.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2
id="risk-002-establish-security-awareness-training-program-high">RISK-002:
Establish Security Awareness Training Program (High)</h2>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop and implement a formal security
awareness training program.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Onboarding:</strong> All new employees must complete a
foundational security awareness training module as part of their
onboarding process.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Annual Training:</strong> All employees must complete a
refresher training course at least once per year to stay informed about
evolving threats.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Phishing Simulations:</strong> Conduct regular, simulated
phishing campaigns to test employee awareness and provide targeted,
just-in-time training to those who click on malicious links.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> A well-trained workforce is a
critical layer of defense. Training reduces the likelihood of successful
social engineering attacks, turning employees from potential victims
into an active part of the organization’s security apparatus.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> High.</p></li>
