<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity assessment for
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, synthesizing information from
organizational questionnaires, technical network scans, and a review of
pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The analysis reveals a mixed security posture. The organization
demonstrates a strong foundation in security policy and awareness
training, with established acceptable use policies and regular training
schedules for all employees. However, this is critically undermined by
significant gaps in access control. The absence of Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and, most importantly, for
access to sensitive data systems, presents a critical risk of
unauthorized access and potential data breach.</p>
<p>A technical scan of the designated target IP address,
<code>[Target IP]</code>, did not identify any open ports or exposed
services. This finding conflicts with a pre-existing documented risk
concerning an unencrypted web server on port 80. This discrepancy
suggests the pre-existing risk may be outdated or related to a different
asset.</p>
<p>Immediate remediation should focus on the deployment of MFA across
all critical systems, followed by a re-validation of the existing risk
register to ensure its accuracy.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>

assessment. As the provided data was anonymized, placeholders have been

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on the target system to identify exposed
services and potential vulnerabilities.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Tool:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Summary:</strong> The scan reported the host as
"up". No open ports were discovered. Port 80 (HTTP) was explicitly
checked and found to be <strong>closed</strong>. This indicates that, at
the time of the scan, the target system was not exposing any common
network services to the internet.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This technical finding directly contradicts a
pre-existing risk documented in the organization’s risk register, which
states that Port 80 is open. This discrepancy requires
investigation.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended to
mitigate the identified risks and improve the overall security posture
of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>[Critical Priority] Implement MFA for Sensitive Data
Access:</strong> Immediately deploy a mandatory MFA solution for all
user accounts (including administrative and service accounts) that have
access to sensitive data systems. This is the single most effective
control to prevent unauthorized access to critical assets.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>[High Priority] Enforce MFA for Endpoint Logins:</strong>
Roll out MFA for all employee and contractor computer logins. This
strengthens initial access controls and contains the impact of
compromised credentials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>[Medium Priority] Validate and Update Risk
Register:</strong> Conduct an internal review to resolve the discrepancy
regarding the "Unencrypted Web Server" risk.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Verify if the risk applies to a different IP address or asset not
included in this assessment’s scope.</p></li>
<li><p>If the service has been decommissioned, formally close the risk
in the register.</p></li>
<li><p>If the service still exists elsewhere, ensure it is secured via
TLS/SSL (HTTPS) and that the risk register accurately reflects its
status.</p></li>
