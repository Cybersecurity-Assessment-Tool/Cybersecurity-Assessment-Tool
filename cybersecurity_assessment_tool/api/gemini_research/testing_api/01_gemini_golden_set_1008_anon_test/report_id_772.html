<h1 id="executive-overview">Executive Overview</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment conducted for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The
assessment combined an external network scan, a review of existing
risks, and an analysis of organizational security controls based on a
provided questionnaire.</p>
<h4 id="key-findings">Key Findings:</h4>
<p>The overall security posture presents a mixed landscape. On a
positive note, the external network scan of the target asset revealed a
strong defensive perimeter, with no open ports detected. This suggests a
well-configured firewall and a minimized external attack surface for the
scanned system.</p>
<p>However, significant and high-risk gaps were identified in internal
security controls. The lack of mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) for computer logins and the absence of a formal security awareness
training program for employees represent critical vulnerabilities. These
procedural and policy-based weaknesses expose the organization to
substantial risks, including unauthorized access, credential theft, and
susceptibility to social engineering attacks like phishing.</p>
<h4 id="summary">Summary:</h4>
<p>While the external network defenses appear robust, the primary
threats to the organization are internal and human-centric. Immediate
action is required to address the identified gaps in endpoint security
and employee training to mitigate these high-severity risks.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following details were used as the basis for this assessment.

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>An analysis of the security questionnaire reveals the organization’s
current implementation of key security controls. "No" answers indicate
significant gaps that increase organizational risk.</p>

<h4 id="analysis">Analysis:</h4>
<p>The organization has successfully implemented MFA for email and
sensitive systems, which is commendable. However, the absence of MFA on
computer logins is a critical oversight. If an employee’s credentials
are stolen, an attacker could gain direct access to their workstation
and potentially the internal network. Furthermore, the complete lack of
a security awareness training program leaves employees unprepared to
identify and respond to common cyber threats such as phishing, creating
a vulnerable human perimeter.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed to identify open ports and
exposed services on the designated target system.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Target:</strong> <code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Status:</strong> The target host was responsive
(status: up).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Findings:</strong> The scan confirmed that <strong>zero
open ports</strong> were detected. All 1000 scanned TCP ports were in a
’closed’ state.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion:</h4>
<p>The absence of open ports is an excellent security posture for an
external-facing asset. It indicates that the firewall is properly
configured to deny all unsolicited incoming traffic, significantly
reducing the external attack surface and protecting the system from
network-based attacks.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actionable recommendations are provided to mitigate the
high-severity risks identified during this assessment.</p>
<h2 id="risk-r-01-lack-of-endpoint-mfa">Risk R-01: Lack of Endpoint
MFA</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Implement and enforce a mandatory
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) policy for all employee computer
logins (desktops and laptops).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> This creates a critical secondary
layer of defense. Even if an employee’s password is compromised, the
attacker will be unable to access the system without the second factor
(e.g., a code from a mobile app, a physical security key).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> <strong>Critical</strong>. This should
be addressed immediately.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="risk-r-02-inadequate-security-awareness-training">Risk R-02:
Inadequate Security Awareness Training</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop and implement a formal,
mandatory security awareness training program. This program should
include:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Onboarding training for all new employees before they are granted
system access.</p></li>
<li><p>Annual refresher training for all staff covering current threats
like phishing, ransomware, and proper data handling.</p></li>
<li><p>Periodic simulated phishing campaigns to test and reinforce
employee knowledge.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> A well-trained workforce is the
first line of defense against many common cyberattacks. Training reduces
the likelihood of human error leading to a security breach.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> <strong>High</strong>. A program
should be developed and implemented within the next quarter.</p></li>
