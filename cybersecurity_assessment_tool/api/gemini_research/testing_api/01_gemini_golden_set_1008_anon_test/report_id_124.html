<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This assessment reveals a mixed cybersecurity posture for
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. On one hand, the organization
demonstrates a strong external network security configuration, with no
open ports detected on the scanned public-facing asset. This indicates
an effective firewall implementation and a minimized external attack
surface, which is a significant strength.</p>
<p>However, the review of internal security controls highlights several
critical and high-risk gaps in policy and procedure. The most severe
finding is the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing
sensitive data systems. This exposes critical assets to significant risk
from credential compromise. Furthermore, the absence of a formal
Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and a mandatory security awareness training
program for new employees creates substantial operational and
human-factor risks.</p>
<p>While no pre-existing vulnerabilities were provided for this
assessment, the identified policy gaps represent foundational weaknesses
that could be exploited by threat actors. Recommendations focus on
immediately addressing these procedural and administrative control
deficiencies to build a more robust, defense-in-depth security
strategy.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="organizational-information">Organizational

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed to identify listening services
and potential vulnerabilities on the organization’s public-facing
infrastructure.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> 2026-01-30</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Used:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="scan-summary">Scan Summary</h2>
<p>The target host was found to be online and responsive to network
probes. However, the scan determined that <strong>no TCP or UDP ports
were open</strong>. All 65,535 ports on the target system were in a
"closed" or "filtered" state.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>This is a positive security finding. It indicates that a
well-configured firewall or security group is in place, effectively
blocking all unsolicited inbound traffic from the internet. This
configuration significantly reduces the external attack surface and is a
commendable security practice. No vulnerabilities were identified from
this external scan.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section correlates the findings from the security control review
and technical scan. The primary risks identified are related to internal
policies and procedures rather than technical vulnerabilities on the
external perimeter.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the identified risks, the following prioritized actions are
recommended to improve the organization’s security posture.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="immediate-priority-critical-risk">Immediate
Priority (Critical Risk)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Recommendation for RISK-001 (MFA on Sensitive
Systems):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediately develop and execute a plan
to enforce MFA for all user accounts (including administrative and
service accounts) that have access to systems storing or processing
sensitive data (e.g., financial systems, customer databases,
intellectual property).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Drastically reduces the risk of
unauthorized access via compromised credentials, protecting the
organization’s most critical assets.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="secondary-priority-high-risks">Secondary
Priority (High Risks)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Recommendation for RISK-002 (Acceptable Use
Policy):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop a formal Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP) that clearly defines the rules for using company networks,
devices, and data. This policy should be communicated to all employees
and signed as a condition of employment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Establishes a clear security baseline
for employee behavior, reduces insider risk, and provides a basis for
disciplinary action in case of policy violation.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Recommendation for RISK-003 (Onboarding
Training):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Integrate a mandatory cybersecurity
awareness module into the new employee onboarding process. This training
should cover key topics such as phishing, password security, data
handling, and the new AUP.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Ensures that all new staff members are
equipped with fundamental security knowledge from day one, reducing
their susceptibility to common cyber threats.</p></li>
