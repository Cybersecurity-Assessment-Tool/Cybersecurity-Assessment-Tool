<h1 id="executive-overview">Executive Overview</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity assessment
conducted for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The analysis is
based on a combination of network scanning, a review of existing risk
documentation, and an evaluation of self-reported security controls.</p>
<p>The assessment reveals a mixed security posture. The organization has
implemented several strong foundational controls, most notably the
consistent enforcement of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across
email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. This significantly
reduces the risk of account compromise through stolen credentials.</p>
<p>However, two critical areas of concern were identified that
substantially elevate the organization’s overall risk profile:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Critical External Exposure:</strong> A network scan
identified a publicly exposed Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) service on
port 3389. This is a high-value target for attackers and a common entry
point for ransomware and other malicious intrusions. This technical
finding directly validates a pre-existing high-severity risk.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Systemic Lack of Security Training:</strong> The
organization does not provide security awareness training to new or
existing employees. This represents a significant gap in the human
firewall, leaving the organization highly vulnerable to phishing, social
engineering, and other attacks that prey on user behavior.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Due to the severity of the exposed RDP service, the overall risk
posture for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong> is assessed as .
Immediate remediation of the identified vulnerabilities is strongly
recommended to reduce the likelihood of a significant security
incident.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following information was used as the basis for this assessment.

<p>The following table summarizes the organization’s self-reported
security controls based on the provided questionnaire data. While
several controls are in place, the gaps identified are significant.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>The "No" responses indicate a complete absence of a formal security
awareness training program. This is a critical deficiency. Without
training, employees are significantly more likely to fall victim to
phishing attacks, mishandle sensitive data, or unintentionally violate
security policies, thereby undermining other technical controls.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed against the target IP address
to identify open ports and exposed services.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-1">Analysis</h2>
<p>The scan confirms that the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) service is
directly exposed to the public internet. RDP is a primary target for
attackers who use brute-force password attacks, credential stuffing, and
exploits for known vulnerabilities (e.g., BlueKeep) to gain unauthorized
access to internal networks. Exposing RDP is extremely dangerous and is
a leading cause of ransomware infections.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actionable recommendations are provided to address the
identified risks. They are prioritized based on severity and potential
impact.</p>
<h2 id="remediation-for-rdp-exposure">Remediation for: RDP Exposure
()</h2>
<p>This vulnerability requires immediate attention to prevent a
potential network compromise.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Action (Containment):</strong> Implement a
firewall rule to <strong>block all inbound traffic to TCP port
3389</strong> on the external interface of the network firewall
protecting <code>[Target IP]</code>. This will immediately remove the
public exposure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Long-Term Solution (Remediation):</strong> Deploy a
secure remote access solution, such as a <strong>Virtual Private Network
(VPN)</strong> with MFA. All remote administration and user access
should occur exclusively through the VPN tunnel. Direct RDP access from
the internet should be permanently disabled.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="remediation-for-lack-of-security-awareness-training">Remediation
for: Lack of Security Awareness Training ()</h2>
<p>Establishing a security-conscious culture is essential for long-term
defense.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Short-Term Action (Foundation):</strong> Procure and
enroll all employees in a reputable security awareness training program.
The initial training should be mandatory and cover, at a minimum:
phishing and spear-phishing identification, password security best
practices, and the organization’s acceptable use policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Long-Term Solution (Program Development):</strong>
Establish a formal, ongoing security awareness program. This program
should include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mandatory training for all new hires as part of their onboarding
process.</p></li>
<li><p>Annual refresher training for all staff.</p></li>
<li><p>Regular simulated phishing campaigns to test and reinforce
learning.</p></li>
