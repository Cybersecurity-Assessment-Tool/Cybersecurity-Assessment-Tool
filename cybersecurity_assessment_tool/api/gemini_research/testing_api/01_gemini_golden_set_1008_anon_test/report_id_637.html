<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity assessment
conducted on November 22, 2025. The evaluation combined a technical
network scan, a review of administrative security controls, and an
analysis of pre-existing risks to provide a holistic view of the
organization’s security posture.</p>
<p>The assessment identified two high-risk issues requiring immediate
attention. Firstly, the external-facing web server at
<code>[Target IP]</code> is running an outdated version of Nginx
(1.18.0), which is known to have multiple vulnerabilities. This exposes
the organization to potential compromise. Secondly, a critical gap was
identified in the organization’s security program: the absence of a
formal security awareness training program for both new and existing
employees. This significantly increases the risk of successful phishing
and social engineering attacks.</p>
<p>While the organization demonstrates strong security practices in
implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across key systems, the
identified vulnerabilities could undermine these controls. This report
provides specific, actionable recommendations to mitigate these risks
and strengthen the overall security posture.</p>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A review of administrative and policy-based security controls was
conducted via a standardized questionnaire. The responses indicate a
strong foundation in identity and access management but reveal critical
deficiencies in employee security training. The results are summarized
in Table <a href="#tab:controls" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="tab:controls">1</a>.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>The two "No" responses (<span style="color: red"></span>) are
significant findings. The lack of a structured security awareness
training program for new hires and the absence of annual refresher
training for all staff create a substantial vulnerability. Employees are
the first line of defense, and without proper training, they are more
susceptible to phishing, malware, and social engineering attacks, which
could bypass technical controls.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed against the target IP address

</div>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-1">Analysis</h2>
<p>The primary finding from the technical scan is the version of the
Nginx web server software: <strong>1.18.0</strong>. This version was
released in April 2020 and is now significantly outdated. It is missing
numerous security patches and is known to be vulnerable to several
publicly disclosed exploits (e.g., related to request smuggling and
improper input validation). Running outdated software on a public-facing
service constitutes a high-risk vulnerability that could lead to a
system compromise, data breach, or denial of service.</p>
<h1 id="consolidated-risk-assessment">Consolidated Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of security controls and technical scan data,
the following risks have been identified. No pre-existing
vulnerabilities were provided for this assessment.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified
risks and improve the organization’s overall security posture.</p>
<h2
id="risk-001-upgrade-web-server-and-implement-patch-management">RISK-001:
Upgrade Web Server and Implement Patch Management</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Action:</strong> Plan and execute an upgrade of
the Nginx server from version 1.18.0 to the latest stable version
recommended by the vendor. This should be done in a test environment
before deploying to production to ensure compatibility.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Strategic Action:</strong> Develop and implement a formal
patch management policy. This policy should mandate regular scanning for
vulnerabilities on all external-facing systems and define a clear
timeline for applying security patches based on severity.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2
id="risk-002-implement-a-comprehensive-security-awareness-program">RISK-002:
Implement a Comprehensive Security Awareness Program</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Action:</strong> Procure and deploy a security
awareness training solution. Enroll all current employees in a
foundational training module covering key topics such as phishing,
password security, and acceptable use.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Strategic Action:</strong> Integrate security awareness
training into the new employee onboarding process. Furthermore,
establish a mandatory annual refresher training program for all staff to
ensure their knowledge remains current. This program should be
supplemented with periodic phishing simulation campaigns to test and
reinforce learning.</p></li>
