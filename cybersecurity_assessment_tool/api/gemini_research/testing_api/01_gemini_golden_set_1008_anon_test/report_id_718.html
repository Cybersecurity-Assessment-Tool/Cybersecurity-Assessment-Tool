<p><strong>Cybersecurity Posture Assessment Report</strong></p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment conducted for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The
assessment incorporated an analysis of organizational security controls
via a questionnaire, a technical network scan of the designated external
asset, and a review of pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The primary finding of this assessment is a <strong>critical gap in
the organization’s security awareness training program</strong>. The
questionnaire revealed that security training is not provided to new
employees during onboarding, nor is it conducted annually for all staff.
This absence represents a high risk, as the human element is a primary
target for cyber-attacks such as phishing and social engineering.</p>
<p>The technical network scan performed on the target IP address did not
identify any open ports or services. While this may indicate a strong
firewall configuration, it also limits the visibility into potential
vulnerabilities on the external perimeter from this assessment’s
perspective. No pre-existing vulnerabilities were provided for
review.</p>
<p>Recommendations focus on the immediate implementation of a
comprehensive security awareness training program to mitigate the
significant human-factor risks identified.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following details were used as the basis for this assessment. The
information has been anonymized as per the engagement requirements.</p>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A review of administrative and technical security controls was
conducted based on the provided questionnaire. The results are
summarized below. "Yes" answers, indicating a control is in place, are
marked with a . "No" answers, indicating a potential control gap, are
marked with a .</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>The organization has implemented strong identity and access
management controls, with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) required for
email, computer logins, and sensitive systems. An acceptable use policy
is also in place. However, the lack of a formal security awareness
training program for new and existing employees is a critical deficiency
that undermines these technical controls.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was conducted to identify open ports,
running services, and potential vulnerabilities on the public-facing
infrastructure.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not specified in scan data.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="findings">Findings</h2>
<p>The network scan completed successfully, but <strong>no open ports or
services were identified</strong> on the target system. This outcome
typically indicates one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The host was not online or responsive at the time of the
scan.</p></li>
<li><p>A robust firewall or Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) is in
place, effectively blocking all incoming probes and hiding services from
external discovery.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>No vulnerabilities can be reported from this scan due to the lack of
discovered services.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes findings from the security control review,
technical scan, and pre-existing risk data. The primary risks identified
are related to procedural and human-factor gaps.</p>

recommended to improve the organization’s cybersecurity posture.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Mandatory Onboarding Security
Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop and implement a mandatory
security awareness training module as part of the new employee
onboarding process.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Details:</strong> This training should cover essential
topics, including the acceptable use policy, phishing identification,
password hygiene, and procedures for reporting security
incidents.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Launch a mandatory, annual security
awareness training program for all employees.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Details:</strong> The program should include refresher
courses on key security topics and be supplemented with periodic
phishing simulation campaigns to test and reinforce employee
knowledge.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> <strong>High</strong></p></li>
