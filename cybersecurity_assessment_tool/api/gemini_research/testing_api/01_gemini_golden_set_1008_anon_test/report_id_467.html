<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the cybersecurity
posture for , based on a combination of network scanning, a review of
existing risks, and an organizational security controls
questionnaire.</p>
<p>The assessment reveals a mixed security posture. The organization
demonstrates strong identity and access management practices by
enforcing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across email, computers, and
sensitive data systems. This is a commendable and critical defense
against credential-based attacks.</p>
<p>However, significant and high-risk gaps were identified in
foundational administrative controls. The complete absence of an
employee Acceptable Use Policy and any form of security awareness
training program (both for new hires and annually) creates a substantial
vulnerability to human-error-related incidents, such as phishing and
social engineering.</p>
<p>Furthermore, technical analysis identified a pre-existing critical
risk, "Localhost Exposed" (CVSS 10.0), associated with the externally
scanned asset at . The presence of an open SSH port on this same asset
compounds the risk, creating a direct and severe attack vector.
Immediate remediation of these findings is strongly recommended to
mitigate the high probability of a security breach.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following details were used as the basis for this assessment. Due
to anonymized input data, placeholders have been used where
necessary.</p>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>An administrative review was conducted based on a security
questionnaire. The results highlight critical gaps in policy and
employee training. While MFA implementation is strong, the lack of
guiding policies and security education undermines its effectiveness by
leaving the organization vulnerable to human-centric threats.</p>

</table>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The "No" responses represent a significant
risk. Without an Acceptable Use Policy, there are no defined rules for
employee behavior regarding corporate assets. The absence of security
training means employees are likely unprepared to identify and respond
to common threats like phishing, malware, and social engineering
attacks.</p>

<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The scan confirmed that port 22 (SSH) is
open and accessible from the internet. SSH is a common protocol for
remote administration. While necessary for management, an exposed SSH
port is a primary target for attackers. It is vulnerable to brute-force
password attacks and exploitation if the running version has known
vulnerabilities. The scan did not provide version details, preventing a
specific vulnerability check.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified
risks. They are prioritized based on severity.</p>
<h2 id="risk-001-localhost-exposed-critical">RISK-001: Localhost Exposed
(Critical)</h2>
<p><strong>Immediate Action Required.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Remediate:</strong> Investigate and remediate the
underlying vulnerability immediately. This may involve applying security
patches, updating software, or reconfiguring the affected
service.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Restrict Access:</strong> If the service on does not need
to be public, place it behind a firewall and require VPN access.
Implement strict firewall rules to only allow traffic from trusted IP
addresses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Note:</strong> The provided risk data did not include
specific remediation steps. A deeper vulnerability assessment is
required to determine the exact cause and fix.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="risk-002-lack-of-security-policy-training-high">RISK-002: Lack
of Security Policy &amp; Training (High)</h2>
<p><strong>Action Required within 30-60 days.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Develop Policy:</strong> Create and implement a formal
Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) that all employees must read and sign. This
policy should clearly define rules for using company networks, devices,
and data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Training:</strong> Institute a mandatory
security awareness training program for all new hires.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Annual Refreshers:</strong> Conduct annual security
awareness training for all staff to keep them updated on the latest
threats and best practices.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="risk-003-exposed-ssh-service-high">RISK-003: Exposed SSH Service
(High)</h2>
<p><strong>Action Required within 7-14 days.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Disable Password Authentication:</strong> Harden the SSH
configuration to disable password-based logins and enforce the use of
public-key cryptography only.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Disable Root Login:</strong> Prohibit direct root login
via SSH by setting ‘PermitRootLogin no‘ in the ‘sshd_config‘ file.
Administrators should log in with a standard user account and elevate
privileges as needed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Fail2Ban:</strong> Deploy a tool like Fail2Ban
to automatically block IP addresses that exhibit malicious behavior,
such as repeated failed login attempts.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The security posture of is characterized by a critical disparity
between strong technical identity controls (MFA) and weak administrative
foundations. While MFA provides a robust defense, the lack of employee
training and policies, combined with a severe technical vulnerability on
an internet-facing system, exposes the organization to significant
risk.</p>
<p>We strongly urge to prioritize the remediation steps outlined in this
report, starting with the critical "Localhost Exposed" vulnerability.
Concurrently, developing and implementing the recommended security
policies and training programs will build a more resilient,
security-conscious culture and strengthen the organization’s overall
defense-in-depth strategy.</p>
