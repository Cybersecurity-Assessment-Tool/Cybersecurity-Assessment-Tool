<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment conducted for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The
assessment synthesizes data from a network perimeter scan, a security
controls questionnaire, and a review of pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The primary finding of this assessment is the presence of critical
gaps in fundamental administrative and identity-related security
controls. Specifically, the lack of mandatory Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for email access represents a critical and
immediate threat, exposing the organization to significant risks such as
Business Email Compromise (BEC) and account takeovers.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the complete absence of a security awareness training
program and an employee acceptable use policy indicates a systemic
weakness in security governance and culture. These gaps substantially
increase the organization’s susceptibility to social engineering,
phishing attacks, and insider threats.</p>
<p>On a technical level, the external network scan of the designated
target did not identify any open ports. This suggests a properly
configured firewall is in place, which is a positive security control.
However, the strength of this perimeter defense is undermined by the
aforementioned administrative control deficiencies.</p>
<p>Immediate remediation efforts should focus on implementing MFA for
email and establishing a foundational security awareness program.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-control-gaps">Analysis of Control
Gaps</h2>
<p>The questionnaire reveals several significant control
deficiencies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA for Email:</strong> The absence of MFA on email is a
critical vulnerability. Email accounts are primary targets for attackers
seeking to launch phishing campaigns, commit financial fraud, or gain a
foothold for lateral movement within the network.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> Lacking an AUP
means there are no formally documented rules for employees regarding the
use of company assets. This creates legal and security ambiguities and
makes it difficult to enforce security standards.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Security Awareness Training:</strong> The lack of any
security training for new or existing employees is a major gap. This
leaves the workforce unprepared to identify and report common threats
like phishing, malware, and social engineering, making them the weakest
link in the organization’s defense.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external, unauthenticated network scan was performed to identify
listening services on the organization’s public-facing
infrastructure.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Scan date not provided in source
data.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="findings">Findings</h2>
<p><strong>No open ports were detected on the target
system.</strong></p>
<p>This result is positive, suggesting that a well-configured firewall
or security group is in place, effectively blocking unsolicited inbound
connection attempts from the internet. This practice, known as "default
deny," is a security best practice and significantly reduces the
external attack surface. While this is a strong indicator of a secure
perimeter, it does not provide visibility into internal vulnerabilities
or misconfigurations.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section correlates the findings from the security control review
and technical scan. The risks are prioritized based on their potential
impact and likelihood. No pre-existing vulnerabilities were provided for
this assessment.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended to
mitigate the identified risks and improve the overall security posture
of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="immediate-priority-critical-risk">Immediate
Priority (Critical Risk)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>RISK-001 Mitigation:</strong> Enforce Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) across all email accounts immediately. This is the
single most effective control to prevent unauthorized account access and
should be treated as an urgent priority.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="high-priority">High Priority</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>RISK-002 Mitigation:</strong> Develop and implement a
comprehensive Security Awareness Training program. This program should
include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mandatory training for all new hires during onboarding.</p></li>
<li><p>Annual mandatory training for all existing employees.</p></li>
<li><p>Regular phishing simulations to test and reinforce
learning.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>RISK-003 Mitigation:</strong> Draft, approve, and
implement a formal employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). This policy
should be communicated to all employees, and acknowledgement of its
review should be tracked.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="general-recommendations">General
Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Continuous Monitoring:</strong> While the external scan
was clean, it is crucial to perform regular vulnerability scans,
including authenticated internal scans, to identify vulnerabilities that
are not visible from the internet.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Policy Review:</strong> Conduct a broader review of all
IT and security policies to identify other potential gaps in
governance.</p></li>
