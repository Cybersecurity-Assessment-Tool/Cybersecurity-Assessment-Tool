<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment conducted for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The
assessment combined an external network scan, a review of existing
risks, and an analysis of organizational security controls based on a
questionnaire.</p>
<p>The overall security posture is considered to be at a
<strong>high-risk level</strong>. Several critical and high-severity
issues were identified that require immediate attention to mitigate the
risk of unauthorized access, data breach, and system compromise.</p>
<h4 id="key-findings">Key Findings:</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Critical - Publicly Exposed Database Service:</strong> A
MySQL database server on port 3306 was found to be directly accessible
from the internet at <code>[Target IP]</code>. This configuration
exposes the database to brute-force attacks and exploitation
attempts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Critical - End-of-Life Software:</strong> The exposed
MySQL service is running version 5.7.33. The entire MySQL 5.7 branch
reached its official End of Life (EOL) in October 2023 and no longer
receives security patches, leaving it vulnerable to known
exploits.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>High - Gaps in Access Control:</strong> Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) is not required for employee computer logins,
significantly weakening a primary defense against credential theft and
unauthorized access to internal resources.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>High - Deficiencies in Security Governance:</strong> The
organization lacks a formal employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and
does not provide security awareness training for new employees. These
foundational controls are essential for establishing a
security-conscious culture and minimizing human error.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Urgent remediation of these findings is strongly recommended. This
report provides specific, actionable recommendations to address each
identified risk.</p>

<h4 id="analysis-of-findings">Analysis of Findings:</h4>
<p>The exposure of a MySQL database (port 3306) is a severe security
risk. Furthermore, the detected version, 5.7.33, is part of a product
line that is no longer supported by its vendor. This means no new
security patches will be released, even for newly discovered critical
vulnerabilities, making this system an easy target for attackers.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified
risks. Recommendations are prioritized based on severity and potential
impact.</p>
<h2 id="risk-001-risk-002-database-exposure-and-eol-software">RISK-001
&amp; RISK-002: Database Exposure and EOL Software</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Action (Containment):</strong> Implement strict
firewall rules to deny all public access to TCP port 3306 on
<code>[Target IP]</code>. Access should only be permitted from specific,
trusted IP addresses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Short-Term (Remediation):</strong> Initiate a project to
upgrade the MySQL database from the EOL 5.7 version to a fully supported
version (e.g., MySQL 8.x). This is critical for receiving future
security patches.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Long-Term (Architectural Improvement):</strong>
Re-architect the network so that the database server is not on a public
IP address. Access should be granted only through a secure baseline,
such as a VPN or an authenticated bastion host.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="risk-003-lack-of-endpoint-mfa">RISK-003: Lack of Endpoint
MFA</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Action (Planning):</strong> Evaluate and select
an MFA solution compatible with your organization’s computer operating
systems (e.g., Windows Hello for Business, Duo, Okta).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Short-Term (Implementation):</strong> Begin a phased
rollout of MFA for all computer logins, starting with IT administrators
and executive leadership, then expanding to all employees.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="risk-004-missing-foundational-policies">RISK-004: Missing
Foundational Policies</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Action (Policy Development):</strong> Draft and
ratify a formal Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) that defines the rules for
using company IT assets. Require all current employees to read and
acknowledge the policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Short-Term (Training Implementation):</strong> Develop or
procure a security awareness training module and integrate it into the
onboarding process for all new employees. This ensures a baseline of
security knowledge from day one.</p></li>
