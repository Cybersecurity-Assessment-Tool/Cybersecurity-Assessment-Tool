<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity assessment
conducted for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The assessment
incorporated an analysis of organizational security controls, a
technical network scan of the external perimeter, and a review of
previously identified risks.</p>
<p>The analysis reveals a mixed security posture. The organization has
implemented foundational controls such as Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) for email and computer access. However, several critical and
high-risk gaps were identified in administrative and policy-based
controls. Specifically, the lack of MFA for sensitive data systems, the
absence of an employee Acceptable Use Policy, and incomplete annual
security awareness training present significant risks.</p>
<p>On the technical front, the external network scan of
<code>[Client IP]</code> indicates a minimal attack surface. A
previously identified risk concerning an open unencrypted web server
port (Port 80) appears to have been remediated, as the port was found to
be closed during the current scan.</p>
<p>This report provides a detailed breakdown of these findings and
offers actionable recommendations to mitigate the identified risks and
strengthen the overall security posture of <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>An internal review of security controls was conducted based on a
standardized questionnaire. The responses highlight key areas of
strength and weakness in the organization’s security policies and
procedures. "No" answers indicate significant gaps that require
immediate attention.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-control-gaps">Analysis of Control Gaps</h2>
<p>The primary concerns identified are the lack of mandatory MFA for
sensitive systems, the absence of a formal Acceptable Use Policy (AUP),
and the failure to conduct annual security training for all staff. These
gaps significantly increase the risk of unauthorized access, insider
threat, and susceptibility to social engineering attacks.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on the designated target IP address to
identify exposed services and potential vulnerabilities.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP:</strong> <code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Utility:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> Up</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="port-scan-findings">Port Scan Findings</h2>
<p>The scan revealed a very limited external attack surface. The
following is a summary of the port status:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 80/tcp (HTTP):</strong> State:
<strong>Closed</strong>. No service was detected.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>No other open or filtered ports were identified during the scan. This
configuration is positive, as it minimizes the exposure of services to
the public internet.</p>
<h2 id="correlation-with-existing-risks">Correlation with Existing
Risks</h2>
<p>The finding that port 80 is closed directly contradicts a previously
documented risk, "Unencrypted Web Server," which was predicated on this
port being open. This indicates that the risk has been successfully
remediated or was a false positive in a prior assessment.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment-and-findings">Risk Assessment and Findings</h1>
<p>The following table summarizes the key risks identified through the
correlation of the security control review and the technical scan. Risks
are prioritized by severity to guide remediation efforts.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and improve the overall security
posture, the following actions are recommended with urgency:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>[Critical] R-01: Implement Comprehensive
MFA</strong><br />
Immediately prioritize the deployment of Multi-Factor Authentication
across all systems that access, store, or process sensitive
organizational or customer data. This is the single most effective
control to prevent unauthorized access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>[High] R-02: Develop and Enforce an Acceptable Use
Policy</strong><br />
Draft, approve, and disseminate a formal AUP that clearly defines the
rules and responsibilities for all employees when using company
networks, systems, and data. Require all employees to read and
acknowledge the policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>[High] R-03: Establish Mandatory Annual Security
Training</strong><br />
Implement a mandatory, recurring security awareness training program for
all employees. The training should be conducted at least annually and
cover topics such as phishing, password security, and data handling best
practices.</p></li>
