<p><strong>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</strong></p>
<p>Prepared for:</p>
<p><strong>[Organization Name]</strong></p>

<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity assessment
conducted for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The assessment
combined an external network scan, a review of existing risk
documentation, and an analysis of organizational security controls based
on a questionnaire.</p>
<p>The assessment identified a <strong>Critical</strong> risk: a
publicly exposed Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) service on the
organization’s external network. This vulnerability is actively targeted
by threat actors for initial access, often leading to ransomware
deployment and data breaches. This technical finding directly validates
a pre-existing documented risk, confirming it remains an active and
unmitigated threat.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a <strong>High</strong> risk was identified in the
organization’s security processes. While annual security training is in
place, there is a critical gap in providing mandatory security awareness
training for new employees during their onboarding. This gap increases
the organization’s susceptibility to social engineering attacks, as new
hires may be unaware of internal security policies and common
threats.</p>
<p>Immediate remediation of the exposed RDP service is strongly
recommended to prevent a potential compromise. Concurrently,
implementing a security training module into the employee onboarding
process is crucial for long-term risk reduction.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>This assessment pertains to the following entity and its associated

posture based on the provided questionnaire. "No" answers indicate
potential gaps in security controls that may increase risk.</p>

</div>
<p>The primary finding from this review is the lack of a mandatory
security training program for new hires. This oversight leaves the
organization vulnerable, as new employees are not immediately equipped
with the knowledge to identify and report security threats like
phishing.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>

</div>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The exposure of RDP (port 3389) is a
significant and immediate threat. This service is a primary target for
brute-force password attacks and exploitation of known vulnerabilities
(e.g., BlueKeep). Successful exploitation provides an attacker with
direct, interactive access to the internal network.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified
risks. Recommendations are prioritized based on severity.</p>
<h2
id="remediation-for-public-rdp-exposure-immediate-priority">Remediation
for Public RDP Exposure (Immediate Priority)</h2>
<p>This critical risk requires immediate attention to prevent a
potential network compromise.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Action:</strong> Block all inbound traffic to
TCP port 3389 on the external firewall for the host at
<code>[Client IP]</code>. This will immediately remove the public
exposure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Long-Term Solution:</strong> Decommission public-facing
RDP entirely. Implement a secure remote access solution, such as a
Virtual Private Network (VPN) with multi-factor authentication (MFA) or
a Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) gateway. This provides authenticated
and encrypted access for authorized users without exposing services
directly to the internet.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="remediation-for-security-training-gap-high-priority">Remediation
for Security Training Gap (High Priority)</h2>
<p>This process gap should be addressed to strengthen the human element
of the organization’s security posture.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Action:</strong> Develop and mandate a security
awareness training module as a required step in the new employee
onboarding process. This training should be completed before the
employee is granted access to sensitive systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Content Suggestions:</strong> The training should cover,
at a minimum:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Phishing and social engineering awareness.</p></li>
<li><p>Password security and MFA policies.</p></li>
<li><p>The organization’s Acceptable Use Policy.</p></li>
<li><p>Procedures for reporting security incidents.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The assessment for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong> has
identified one critical technical vulnerability and one high-risk
administrative gap. The public exposure of the Remote Desktop Protocol
service poses an immediate and substantial threat that must be
remediated without delay.</p>
<p>By implementing the recommendations outlined in this report—namely,
securing remote access infrastructure and enhancing the employee
onboarding process with security training—the organization can
significantly improve its security posture and reduce its risk of a
cyber incident.</p>
