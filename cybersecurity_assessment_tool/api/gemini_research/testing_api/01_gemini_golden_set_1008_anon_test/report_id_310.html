<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on a synthesis of
organizational data, a security controls questionnaire, and an external
network vulnerability scan. The assessment was conducted to identify key
security risks and provide actionable recommendations to enhance the
organization’s cyber defense capabilities.</p>
<p>The analysis reveals a mixed security posture. The organization has
implemented some positive security controls, such as requiring
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer and sensitive system
access. However, several critical and high-risk gaps were identified
that expose the organization to significant threats, particularly
related to phishing, insider threats, and social engineering.</p>
<p><strong>Key Findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Critical Risk:</strong> The absence of MFA for email
access is a critical vulnerability. Email is a primary vector for
account compromise, and this gap significantly increases the risk of
business email compromise (BEC) and subsequent data breaches.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>High Risks:</strong> The lack of a formal Acceptable Use
Policy (AUP) and the omission of security awareness training for new
employees represent high-risk policy and procedural gaps. These
deficiencies can lead to inconsistent security practices and make the
organization more susceptible to human-error-related incidents.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Positive Finding:</strong> The external network scan of
the designated target IP address (<code>[Client IP]</code>) revealed no
open ports. This indicates a strong firewall configuration at the
network perimeter, which effectively reduces the external attack
surface.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Immediate remediation should focus on implementing MFA for email,
developing and enforcing an AUP, and integrating security training into
the employee onboarding process.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network vulnerability scan was performed to identify open
ports, running services, and potential vulnerabilities visible from the
public internet.</p>
<h2 id="scan-target">Scan Target</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> The scan was performed as part of
this assessment.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="findings">Findings</h2>
<p>The scan completed successfully against the target IP address.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Result:</strong> No open TCP or UDP ports were
discovered.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>The absence of open ports is a positive security finding. It suggests
that a well-configured firewall or security group is in place, enforcing
a "default deny" policy for unsolicited inbound traffic. This
significantly reduces the external attack surface and protects internal
systems from direct network-based attacks from the internet. While this
is a strong control, it does not mitigate risks from other vectors such
as phishing or web application vulnerabilities.</p>
<h1 id="overall-risk-assessment">Overall Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes findings from the security control review,
technical scans, and pre-existing risk data. The resulting risks are
prioritized by severity to guide remediation efforts. No pre-existing
vulnerabilities were reported for this assessment.</p>

<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Lack of MFA on Email</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The absence of MFA on email accounts
allows an attacker with stolen credentials (e.g., from a phishing attack

to data exfiltration, internal phishing, and business email
compromise.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>No Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP)</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Without a formal AUP, employees lack clear
guidelines on the secure and acceptable use of company assets. This
increases the risk of unintentional data exposure, malware infections
from unauthorized software, and legal liability.</td>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actionable recommendations are provided to address the
identified risks. They are prioritized based on the severity of the
corresponding risk.</p>
<h2 id="critical-priority">Critical Priority</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Access:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Enforce mandatory MFA for all user
accounts accessing the email system (e.g., Microsoft 365, Google
Workspace).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Drastically reduces the risk of email
account takeover, even if user credentials are compromised. This is the
single most effective control to mitigate the risk of business email
compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Timeline:</strong> Immediate (1-7 days).</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="high-priority">High Priority</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Create a formal AUP document that
clearly defines the rules for using company networks, devices, and data.
The policy should be communicated to all employees, and acknowledgement
should be tracked.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Establishes a clear security baseline
for employee behavior, reduces insider risk, and provides a basis for
disciplinary action in case of policy violations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Timeline:</strong> 30-60 days.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Integrate Security Training into Employee
Onboarding:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop a mandatory security awareness
training module for all new employees. This module should cover key
topics such as phishing identification, password hygiene, data handling,
and the new AUP.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Equips new hires with essential security
knowledge from day one, reducing their susceptibility to common cyber
threats and establishing a culture of security within the
organization.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Timeline:</strong> 30-60 days.</p></li>
</ul></li>
