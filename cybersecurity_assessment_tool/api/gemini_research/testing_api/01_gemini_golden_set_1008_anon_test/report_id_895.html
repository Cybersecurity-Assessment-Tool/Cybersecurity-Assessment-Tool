<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the cybersecurity
posture for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The assessment is
based on a correlation of organizational data, a review of existing
security controls, and an external network scan.</p>
<p>The analysis identified several critical and high-risk gaps in the
organization’s security framework. Key findings include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Critical Control Gap:</strong> Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) is not enforced for accessing sensitive data
systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access
and potential data breach from compromised credentials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>High-Risk Policy Gaps:</strong> The organization lacks a
formal Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and does not provide security
awareness training for new employees. These foundational elements are
essential for establishing a security-conscious culture and mitigating
insider threats.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>High-Risk Technical Finding:</strong> The external
network scan revealed an open Secure Shell (SSH) port (22/TCP). Exposed
management services like SSH are primary targets for brute-force attacks
and exploitation if not properly secured.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The overall security posture is considered to be at a <strong>High
Risk</strong> level due to these fundamental deficiencies in both policy
and technical controls. Immediate remediation is recommended to address
the identified vulnerabilities and reduce the organization’s attack
surface.</p>

<p>A review of the organization’s security controls was conducted via a
standardized questionnaire. The responses highlight significant gaps in
access control and employee security awareness programs. A "No" response
indicates a deviation from security best practices and a potential area
of high risk.</p>

<h2 id="technical-analysis">Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>The presence of an open SSH port (22) represents a significant
security risk. SSH is a common protocol for remote server
administration. If exposed to the internet, it becomes a primary target
for automated brute-force attacks, where attackers attempt to guess
usernames and passwords. Without information on the specific version or
configuration, it is assumed to be a high-risk finding that requires
immediate attention and hardening.</p>
<h1 id="consolidated-risk-assessment">Consolidated Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>The following table synthesizes findings from the security control
review, technical scan, and pre-existing risk data. Each risk is
assigned a severity level based on its potential impact and likelihood
of exploitation. As no pre-existing risks were provided, this assessment
is based solely on new findings.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following prioritized recommendations are provided to mitigate
the identified risks and improve the overall security posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="priority-1-remediate-critical-risks">Priority 1: Remediate
Critical Risks</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Systems (RISK-001):</strong>
Immediately enforce Multi-Factor Authentication for all access to
systems containing sensitive or critical data. This is the single most
effective control to prevent unauthorized access from compromised
credentials.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="priority-2-remediate-high-risks">Priority 2: Remediate High
Risks</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Secure Exposed SSH Service (RISK-002):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>If remote access is not required, block port 22 at the network
firewall.</p></li>
<li><p>If access is required, restrict access to a list of trusted IP
addresses (IP allowlist).</p></li>
<li><p>Disable password-based authentication and enforce the use of
public-key cryptography.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure the SSH service is patched and running an up-to-date
version.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(RISK-003):</strong> Create a formal AUP that clearly defines the rules
and responsibilities for all employees when using company assets and
data. Require all employees to read and acknowledge the policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish New Hire Security Training (RISK-003):</strong>
Integrate mandatory cybersecurity awareness training into the employee
onboarding process. This training should cover key topics such as
phishing, password hygiene, and the AUP.</p></li>
