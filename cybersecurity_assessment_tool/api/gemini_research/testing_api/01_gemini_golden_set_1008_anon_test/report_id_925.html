<h1 id="executive-overview">Executive Overview</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity assessment
conducted on November 22, 2025. The assessment combined a technical
network scan, a review of organizational security controls, and an
analysis of pre-existing risks to evaluate the overall security posture
of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>.</p>
<p>The organization has implemented several foundational security
controls, including Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and
computer access. However, the assessment identified critical
deficiencies that expose the organization to significant risk.</p>
<p>Key findings include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Critical Control Gap:</strong> Multi-Factor
Authentication is not enforced for accessing sensitive data systems.
This represents a severe risk, as a single compromised credential could
lead to a major data breach.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>High-Risk Technical Vulnerability:</strong> The
external-facing web server is running an outdated version of Nginx
(1.18.0), which is known to have multiple security
vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>High-Risk Procedural Gap:</strong> The organization does
not provide mandatory, recurring security awareness training for all
employees, increasing susceptibility to phishing and social engineering
attacks.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Immediate remediation of these issues is strongly recommended to
reduce the risk of unauthorized access, data exfiltration, and service
disruption.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following information was used as the basis for this assessment.
Due to the anonymized nature of the provided data, placeholders have

<h1 id="security-control-review-questionnaire">Security Control Review
(Questionnaire)</h1>
<p>An administrative and procedural control review was conducted based
on a security questionnaire. The responses indicate gaps in critical
areas of the security program. A "No" response () signifies a deviation
from security best practices and a potential risk.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>The scan identified a single open port (443/TCP) running an Nginx web
server, version 1.18.0. This version was released in April 2020 and is
now considered outdated. It is missing years of critical security
patches and is vulnerable to numerous publicly disclosed exploits
(Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures - CVEs). An unpatched,
internet-facing web server presents a high-risk entry point for
attackers.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the risks identified in this assessment, the following
prioritized actions are recommended to improve the security posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>[Critical] Implement MFA on Sensitive Systems
(RISK-001):</strong> Immediately prioritize and enforce MFA for all user
accounts (including administrative and service accounts) that have
access to sensitive data repositories, databases, and critical
applications. This is the single most effective control to mitigate the
risk of a credential-based breach.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>[High] Upgrade Web Server Software (RISK-002):</strong>
Plan and execute an upgrade of the Nginx web server from version 1.18.0
to the latest stable version. Establish a patch management policy to
ensure all internet-facing systems are updated in a timely manner to
protect against newly discovered vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>[High] Establish an Annual Security Training Program
(RISK-003):</strong> Develop and implement a mandatory security
awareness training program for all employees, to be completed annually.
The training should cover topics such as phishing identification,
password hygiene, and acceptable use policies to create a more resilient
human firewall.</p></li>
