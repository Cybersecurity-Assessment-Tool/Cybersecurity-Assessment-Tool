<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of , based on a recent
network scan, a security questionnaire, and a review of pre-existing
risk documentation. The assessment aims to identify critical gaps,
technical vulnerabilities, and provide actionable recommendations to
enhance the overall security stance.</p>
<p>Key findings include significant gaps in foundational security
controls such as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) implementation for
critical systems and the absence of comprehensive security awareness
training programs. Technically, the network scan revealed no immediately
exploitable open ports on the primary target, which contradicts a
pre-existing risk assessment regarding an "Unencrypted Web Server." This
discrepancy suggests either successful remediation or an outdated risk
entry. However, the identified control gaps present a substantial risk
of compromise through social engineering or credential-based
attacks.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> The scan found Port 80 to be <strong>closed</strong>.
This finding is critical as it directly contradicts an existing risk
assessment (detailed in Section <a href="#sec:risk_assessment"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:risk_assessment">5</a>)
which indicates "Port 80 is open" as the basis for an "Unencrypted Web
Server" vulnerability. This suggests that either the port has been
recently closed, or the existing risk assessment may be outdated or
refer to a different asset.</p>

<h2 id="critical-gaps-from-security-control-review">Critical Gaps from
Security Control Review</h2>
<p>Based on the questionnaire responses, several critical security
control gaps have been identified:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Email Access:</strong> Without MFA, email
accounts are highly susceptible to credential stuffing, phishing, and
brute-force attacks, potentially leading to business email compromise
(BEC).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins:</strong> Absence of MFA
for computer logins increases the risk of unauthorized access to
workstations and internal network resources if credentials are
stolen.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong>
Without a formal AUP, employees may be unaware of their responsibilities
regarding company IT assets, increasing legal and security
risks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Insufficient Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong> New employees are particularly vulnerable targets
for social engineering and phishing attacks due to a lack of immediate
security awareness, posing an immediate risk upon onboarding.</p></li>

<p><em>Note on "Unencrypted Web Server":</em> As highlighted in Section
4, the recent network scan shows Port 80 to be <strong>closed</strong>.
This directly contradicts the overview provided for this existing
vulnerability ("Port 80 is open"). It is highly probable that this risk
has been remediated or the associated asset no longer exists/is exposed.
Further investigation is required to confirm the status and update the
risk register accordingly.</p>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the security posture, the following
recommendations are provided to enhance the security of :</p>
<h2 id="immediate-actions">Immediate Actions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Access:</strong> Mandate
Multi-Factor Authentication for all email access across the
organization. This is a critical control against credential
compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Logins:</strong> Extend MFA
requirements to all computer login processes, especially for privileged
accounts and endpoints accessing sensitive data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a comprehensive AUP for all employees, clearly
outlining the proper use of company IT resources, data, and internet
access. Ensure all employees acknowledge and understand this
policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Re-evaluate "Unencrypted Web Server" Risk:</strong> Due
to the discrepancy between the network scan and the existing risk entry,
conduct an immediate review to determine if Port 80 is indeed closed and
whether the web server in question is no longer exposed or has been
secured. Update the risk register to reflect the current
status.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="security-awareness-and-policy">Security Awareness and
Policy</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Mandatory Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong> Integrate a mandatory, comprehensive security
awareness training module into the onboarding process for all new hires
before they gain access to company systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Policy Reviews:</strong> Establish a schedule for
regular review and updates of all security policies, including the AUP
and MFA policies, to ensure they remain relevant and effective.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="technical-improvements-long-term">Technical Improvements
(Long-Term)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Regular Vulnerability Scanning:</strong> Implement a
routine schedule for internal and external vulnerability scanning to
continuously identify and address potential weaknesses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Patch Management Review:</strong> Ensure a robust patch
management program is in place to keep all operating systems and
applications up-to-date, minimizing exposure to known
vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Access Control Review:</strong> Regularly review access
controls to ensure that only authorized personnel have access to
sensitive systems and data, aligning with the existing MFA
implementation for sensitive data systems.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>While the technical scan showed a relatively clean external perimeter
with no immediately exploitable open ports on the target , the
identified gaps in foundational security controls represent significant
vulnerabilities. Addressing the lack of MFA for email and computer
logins, coupled with establishing a robust security awareness program
and an AUP, should be top priorities for . Furthermore, the discrepancy
concerning the "Unencrypted Web Server" risk highlights the importance
of keeping risk registers current and aligned with actual technical
posture. Proactive implementation of these recommendations will
significantly strengthen the organization’s cybersecurity defenses
against prevalent threats.</p>
