<h2 id="questionnaire-analysis-summary">Questionnaire Analysis
Summary</h2>
<p>Several critical gaps were identified based on the "No" responses,
indicating areas where security controls are either absent or
insufficient according to best practices:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA for Computer Logins</strong>: The absence of
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins significantly
increases the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised
credentials, making systems vulnerable to phishing and brute-force
attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)</strong>: Lack of a
formal AUP means there are no clear, documented guidelines for employees
on appropriate and secure use of organizational IT resources. This can
lead to inconsistent behavior, potential misuse, and increased risk of
security incidents originating from employee actions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>New Employee Security Awareness Training</strong>:
Failing to provide mandatory security awareness training to new
employees leaves a significant vulnerability during the onboarding
process. New hires may not be immediately aware of organizational
security policies, common threats (e.g., phishing), or their role in
maintaining security, making them high-risk targets.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed to identify open ports and services on
the target system. This scan provides an external perspective of the
network’s exposure.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Target</strong>: <code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Used</strong>: Nmap</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="open-ports-and-services">Open Ports and Services</h2>
<p>The scan identified the following open ports:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 22/tcp (SSH)</strong>: This port is commonly used
for Secure Shell access, enabling secure remote administration. While
SSH itself is a secure protocol, its exposure to the internet requires
careful management. Without further details regarding the service
version, product, or specific configurations, it is critical to ensure
that the SSH service is regularly patched, employs strong authentication
methods (e.g., key-based authentication), and access is restricted to
necessary IP ranges only.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="risk-assessment-and-correlation">Risk Assessment and
Correlation</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes findings from the security questionnaire,
technical network scan, and pre-existing vulnerabilities to provide a
comprehensive risk assessment. Risks are categorized by severity to help
prioritize remediation efforts.</p>

</div>
<h2 id="detailed-risk-overview">Detailed Risk Overview</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins (High)</strong>: Without
MFA, a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access
to an employee’s workstation and potentially allow lateral movement into
internal network resources. This significantly elevates the risk of
successful credential-based attacks, data breaches, and ransomware
incidents.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(Medium)</strong>: A missing AUP creates a significant gap in
organizational governance and employee accountability. This could lead
to employees engaging in insecure practices (e.g., installing
unauthorized software, visiting malicious websites) or misusing company
resources, inadvertently increasing the attack surface and potential for
security incidents.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Missing Security Training for New Employees
(High)</strong>: New hires are often prime targets for social
engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) as they may be
unfamiliar with organizational security procedures, common threats, and
the appropriate channels for reporting suspicious activities. The lack
of immediate and mandatory training leaves them unprepared and the
organization vulnerable.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Localhost Exposed (Critical)</strong>: This pre-existing
vulnerability, with a reported CVSS score of 10.0, indicates a severe
configuration issue where internal services or sensitive data are
directly accessible, likely from external networks. This poses an
immediate and grave risk, potentially allowing for full system
compromise, data exfiltration, or denial-of-service attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open SSH (Port 22) Exposure (Moderate)</strong>: While
SSH is a secure protocol for remote access, having it openly accessible
on an external interface, particularly without specific source IP
restrictions or robust key-based authentication, presents a potential
attack vector. It can be subject to brute-force attacks or exploitation
of unpatched SSH versions, which could lead to unauthorized access to
the underlying system.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the comprehensive assessment, the following actionable
recommendations are provided to enhance the cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. These recommendations are

(AUP)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action</em>: Draft a clear, comprehensive, and concise AUP
document outlining appropriate use of all organizational IT resources
(e.g., computers, networks, internet, software, email). Communicate it
to all employees, obtain signed acknowledgments, and establish
enforcement mechanisms.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit</em>: Establishes clear guidelines for responsible IT
resource usage, reduces insider risk, and provides a basis for
disciplinary action in case of policy violations.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Secure Open SSH (Port 22) Configurations</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Restrict SSH access to only trusted source IP addresses or
networks using firewall rules.</p></li>
<li><p>Disable password authentication in favor of strong, key-based
authentication.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure the SSH server software is kept up-to-date and patched
against known vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement a robust logging and monitoring strategy for SSH access
attempts.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider changing the default SSH port to a non-standard port to
reduce automated scanning noise (though not a primary security
measure).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit</em>: Reduces the external attack surface and
fortifies remote access mechanisms against unauthorized attempts and
exploits.</p></li>
</ul></li>
