<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings from a cybersecurity posture
assessment for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on an Nmap
scan, a security control questionnaire, and a review of existing risks.
The assessment identified several areas of strength, particularly
concerning Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) implementation for critical
systems. However, critical gaps were identified in formal employee
policy enforcement, continuous security awareness training, and the use
of outdated software versions for internet-facing services. Remediation
of these findings is crucial to enhance the overall security posture and
significantly reduce the organization’s attack surface against evolving
cyber threats.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An Nmap scan was conducted on the target system on . The following
open port and service were identified:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> Up</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Port:</strong> 443</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Service:</strong> HTTPS</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Product:</strong> Nginx</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.18.0</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The Nginx web server identified on port
443 is version 1.18.0. This version was released in 2020 and is
significantly outdated compared to current stable releases (e.g., Nginx
1.26.x as of late 2024). Running outdated software, especially on
internet-facing services like a web server, exposes the organization to
known vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. These
vulnerabilities can lead to various security incidents, including
unauthorized access, data breaches, or denial of service. It is
imperative to keep all software, particularly public-facing services,
updated to the latest stable versions to benefit from security patches,
performance improvements, and enhanced features.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the provided data, the following risks have
been identified, categorized by their severity and detailed with an
overview. No pre-existing vulnerabilities were provided for this
assessment.</p>

<td style="text-align: left;">Missing Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP)</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">High</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The organization lacks a formal Acceptable
Use Policy, which is crucial for defining expected employee conduct
regarding organizational IT resources and data. This absence can lead to
inconsistent employee behavior, misuse of company assets, and an
increased risk of security incidents due to lack of clear
guidelines.</td>

Training</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Medium</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">While new employees receive initial
security training, there is no mandatory annual security awareness
training for all employees. This leaves the organization vulnerable to
evolving threats, as employees may forget best practices, become
complacent, or be unaware of new attack vectors like sophisticated
phishing campaigns.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;">Outdated Nginx Web Server (1.18.0)</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Medium</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The Nginx web server running on an
internet-facing port (443) is version 1.18.0, which is significantly
outdated. This version may contain known Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures (CVEs) that could be exploited by attackers, potentially
leading to unauthorized access, remote code execution, data breaches, or
service disruption.</td>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and significantly enhance the
organization’s cybersecurity posture, the following actionable
recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create a comprehensive AUP that clearly outlines employee
responsibilities and acceptable behaviors when using company IT
resources, data, and networks.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure the AUP covers critical topics such as data handling,
internet usage, software installation, use of personal devices (BYOD),
social media guidelines, and the procedure for reporting security
incidents.</p></li>
<li><p>Mandate all employees read, understand, and formally acknowledge
the AUP upon hiring and annually thereafter to ensure ongoing awareness
and compliance.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Mandatory Annual Security Awareness Training
for All Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Establish a robust program for mandatory annual security
awareness training for all employees, not just new hires. This ensures
continuous education and reinforcement.</p></li>
<li><p>Training content should be engaging, up-to-date with current
threat landscapes (e.g., advanced phishing techniques, ransomware,
social engineering, business email compromise), and tailored to the
organization’s specific risks and industry.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct regular simulated phishing exercises and other awareness
campaigns to gauge employee vigilance and reinforce learned
behaviors.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade and Patch Nginx Web Server:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Immediately plan and execute an upgrade of the Nginx web server
on port 443 to the latest stable version (e.g., Nginx 1.26.0 or newer).
This will ensure all known vulnerabilities are patched.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement a robust patch management policy for all
internet-facing services and critical software, ensuring that security
updates and patches are identified, tested, and applied promptly and
regularly.</p></li>
<li><p>Before deploying updates to production, thoroughly test them in a
staging environment to prevent service disruption and identify any
compatibility issues.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>This cybersecurity posture assessment has provided a clear view of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>’s current security landscape. While
the organization demonstrates commendable efforts in Multi-Factor
Authentication implementation, critical gaps exist in fundamental policy
enforcement, continuous employee education, and software lifecycle
management for public-facing services. Addressing the outlined
recommendations will significantly strengthen the organization’s
defenses against current and emerging cyber threats, thereby reducing
overall risk and enhancing resilience.</p>
