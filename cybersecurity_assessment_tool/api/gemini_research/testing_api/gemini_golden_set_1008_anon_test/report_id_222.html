<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, analyzing network scan data,
internal security questionnaire responses, and pre-existing risk
information. The organization demonstrates positive practices in
maintaining regular security awareness training for its employees.
However, critical vulnerabilities were identified due to the absence of
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across email, computer login, and
sensitive data systems, alongside the lack of a formal Employee
Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). A recent network scan revealed no open
ports on the target <code>[Target IP]</code>, a positive finding that
notably contradicts a pre-existing risk concerning an "Unencrypted Web
Server" on Port 80. This discrepancy suggests that the risk may be
outdated or remediated. Immediate implementation of MFA and the
establishment of an AUP are paramount to significantly enhance the
overall security posture and reduce the organization’s attack
surface.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-questionnaire-gaps">Analysis of
Questionnaire Gaps</h2>
<p>The questionnaire responses reveal significant foundational
weaknesses in the organization’s security posture:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> MFA
is not mandated for accessing email, logging into computers, or
accessing sensitive data systems. This constitutes a severe
vulnerability, as successful credential compromise (e.g., via phishing,
brute-force) could grant unauthorized access to critical corporate
resources without an additional layer of verification. This
significantly increases the risk of data breaches and system
compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong>
The organization lacks a formal AUP. Without clear guidelines on the
acceptable use of IT resources, employees may unknowingly engage in
practices that introduce security risks, such as installing unauthorized
software, mishandling sensitive data, or visiting malicious websites.
This absence increases the risk from insider threats and reduces overall
compliance and governance.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">3. Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed using Nmap on the specified target. The
objective was to identify any open ports and running services that could
serve as potential entry points for external attackers.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="scan-details">Scan Details</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP:</strong></p></li>

metadata)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="findings">Findings</h2>
<p>The Nmap scan results indicate that <strong>no open ports were
identified</strong> on the target host. Specifically, Port 80 was found
to be <strong>closed</strong>. This is a positive finding, as open ports
frequently represent the primary attack surface for external
adversaries. The absence of open ports reduces the immediate external
attack vectors.</p>

</div>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="risk-analysis-and-correlation">Risk Analysis
and Correlation</h2>
<p>The most pressing risks identified are directly related to the
organization’s internal security practices as revealed by the
questionnaire:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Critical Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Deficiencies:</strong> The pervasive lack of MFA across critical access
points (email, computer login, sensitive data systems) creates an
extremely broad attack surface. A single compromised credential could
grant an attacker significant access, leading to widespread compromise
or data loss. This represents the highest immediate and impactful
risk.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> This
organizational gap signifies a lack of formalized governance over
employee IT usage, increasing the potential for unintentional or
malicious actions that could lead to security incidents, data leakage,
or legal liabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Discrepancy in Technical Findings vs. Existing
Risk:</strong> A significant finding is the contradiction between the
previous "Unencrypted Web Server" risk (stating Port 80 is open) and the
current Nmap scan, which clearly shows Port 80 as closed. While the
original risk had a medium severity, the current technical evidence
indicates this specific vulnerability is likely remediated or was never
present on the scanned target. This highlights the importance of
regularly validating risk register entries against current technical
assessments.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">5. Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis, the following actionable recommendations are
provided to significantly enhance the cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Universally
(Critical Priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Action:</strong> Deploy and enforce MFA for all
employee email accounts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Next Steps:</strong> Implement MFA for all corporate
computer logins.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Long-term Goal:</strong> Extend MFA to all sensitive data
systems and applications used within the organization.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP) (High Priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Action:</strong> Draft a comprehensive AUP that
clearly outlines acceptable and unacceptable use of all company IT
resources (hardware, software, networks, data).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Next Steps:</strong> Distribute the AUP to all employees,
ensure understanding, and obtain signed acknowledgments of
adherence.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Long-term Goal:</strong> Integrate AUP review and
enforcement into ongoing security awareness training and HR
policies.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Review and Update Risk Register (Medium
Priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Action:</strong> Investigate the discrepancy
regarding the "Unencrypted Web Server" risk. Verify that Port 80 is
indeed closed and remains so.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Next Steps:</strong> If verified as remediated,
officially update the risk register to reflect the current status (e.g.,
"Closed," "Remediated"), including the date of remediation.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Continue Security Awareness Training (Ongoing
Priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Ongoing Action:</strong> Maintain and regularly update
security awareness training for all employees, including new hires, to
reinforce best practices, introduce new threats, and ensure policy
adherence (including the new AUP).</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>While <strong>[Organization Name]</strong> demonstrates diligence in
security awareness training and currently presents a secure external
network perimeter (no open ports), the pervasive lack of MFA and the
absence of a foundational AUP introduce significant and critical risks.
Prioritizing the implementation of strong identity verification
mechanisms (MFA) and establishing clear behavioral guidelines (AUP) will
fundamentally strengthen the organization’s defense capabilities against
common cyber threats and cultivate a significantly more secure
operational environment.</p>
