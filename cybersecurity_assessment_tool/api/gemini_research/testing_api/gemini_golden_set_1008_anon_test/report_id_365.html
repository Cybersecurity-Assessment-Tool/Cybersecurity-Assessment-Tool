<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong> based on a targeted network scan, a
security questionnaire, and pre-existing risk data. Our analysis reveals
several critical vulnerabilities and significant control gaps. Most
notably, Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is directly exposed on
<code>[Target IP]</code>, a finding that is severely compounded by the
organization’s current lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
computer logins. This combination presents an extreme risk of
unauthorized access, credential compromise, and potential system
takeover. Furthermore, foundational security controls, such as a
comprehensive acceptable use policy and regular security awareness
training, are either absent or insufficient, indicating a nascent
security program. Addressing these critical and high-priority
recommendations is essential to rapidly elevate the organization’s
security resilience and reduce its attack surface.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following information was provided for the assessment. Where
specific details were not available, placeholders have been used to

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A review of key security controls through a questionnaire highlights
areas of strength and significant weaknesses within the organization’s
security framework. While MFA is utilized for email and sensitive data
access, its absence for general computer logins represents a critical
access control gap. Additionally, the lack of fundamental policies and
consistent training programs points to a need for foundational security
program development.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A targeted network scan was performed to identify open ports and
services on the specified target. The scan results revealed one critical
finding.</p>
<h2 id="scan-details">Scan Details</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target Host:</strong> <code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Tool:</strong> Nmap</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Service:</strong> Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol
(ms-wbt-server)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Status:</strong> Open</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Observed Risk:</strong> The direct exposure of Remote
Desktop Protocol (RDP) on <code>[Target IP]</code> constitutes a severe
security risk. RDP is a high-value target for threat actors, frequently
exploited through brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, and known
vulnerabilities to gain initial access, maintain persistence, or deploy
malware. Without robust compensating controls (e.g., VPN, MFA, strong
access restrictions), this open port significantly increases the
organization’s attack surface.</p></li>

<td style="text-align: center;">Critical</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Remote Desktop Protocol (port 3389) is
directly exposed on <code>[Target IP]</code>. This service is a primary
target for attackers seeking initial access, credential brute-forcing,

<td style="text-align: left;">The absence of Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) for computer logins significantly increases the risk of successful
credential-based attacks (e.g., phishing, brute-force), making systems
vulnerable to compromise even with strong passwords. This risk is
amplified by the exposed RDP service.</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">High</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The lack of a formal Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP) means employees may be unaware of their responsibilities regarding
secure IT usage, potentially leading to unintentional data breaches,
malware infections, or policy violations stemming from inappropriate
system use.</td>

(Questionnaire)</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">High</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The absence of regular security awareness
training for both new and existing employees leaves the organization
highly susceptible to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing,
vishing, pretexting) and makes employees less likely to identify and
report suspicious activities or adhere to security best practices.</td>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and substantially enhance the
overall cybersecurity posture, the following actionable recommendations
are provided. These are prioritized based on their severity, potential
impact, and interconnectedness.</p>
<h2 id="critical-recommendations">Critical Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immediately Secure Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
Access:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Restrict Direct Internet Access:</strong> Implement a
Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution, requiring all users to connect
to the VPN before accessing any internal resources, including RDP. This
completely removes RDP from direct internet exposure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Firewall Restrictions:</strong> If a VPN cannot be
immediately deployed, configure firewall rules to strictly limit RDP
access (Port 3389) to only trusted, whitelisted IP addresses. Avoid
‘0.0.0.0/0‘ (any IP) access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Account Lockout Policies:</strong> Configure
Group Policy or local security policies to lock out user accounts after
a small number of failed login attempts to deter brute-force
attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Apply Security Patches:</strong> Ensure all systems
running RDP are fully patched with the latest security updates to
address known vulnerabilities.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer
Logins:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Deploy MFA for all user logins to company computers, particularly
for any systems accessible remotely (e.g., via RDP). This significantly
raises the bar for attackers, as stolen credentials alone would not be
sufficient for unauthorized access.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="high-priority-recommendations">High Priority
Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement a Formal Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create a clear, comprehensive AUP that explicitly defines
employee responsibilities and permissible behaviors when using company
IT assets, networks, and data.</p></li>
<li><p>Require all employees to read and formally acknowledge their
understanding and agreement to the AUP upon hiring and periodically
thereafter (e.g., annually).</p></li>
<li><p>Integrate AUP principles into new employee onboarding and ongoing
training.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish and Conduct Regular Security Awareness Training
Programs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>New Employee Training:</strong> Implement mandatory
security awareness training for all new employees during their
onboarding process, covering foundational security concepts, company
policies, and threat recognition.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Annual Training for All Employees:</strong> Conduct
mandatory, engaging security awareness training for all existing
employees at least once per year. This training should be updated
regularly to reflect current threat landscapes (e.g., new phishing
tactics, ransomware trends).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Phishing Simulations:</strong> Consider running
controlled phishing simulation campaigns to test employee vigilance and
reinforce the lessons learned from security awareness training in a
practical context.</p></li>
</ul></li>
