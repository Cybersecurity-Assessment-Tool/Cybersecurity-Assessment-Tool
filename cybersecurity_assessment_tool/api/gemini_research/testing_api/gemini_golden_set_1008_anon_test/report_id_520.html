<h2 id="analysis-of-security-control-gaps">Analysis of Security Control
Gaps</h2>
<p>The review of security control questions identified several critical
areas requiring immediate attention:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA for Computer Logins:</strong> The absence of MFA for
computer logins significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access
due to compromised credentials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> A lack of
an AUP means employees may not be fully aware of their responsibilities
regarding organizational assets and data, leading to potential misuse or
accidental data breaches.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Security Awareness Training:</strong> The absence of
security awareness training for both new and existing employees leaves
the organization vulnerable to social engineering attacks (e.g.,
phishing) and makes employees less likely to recognize and report
security incidents.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A basic Nmap network scan was performed against the specified
target.</p>
<h2 id="scan-metadata">Scan Metadata</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> Up</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="open-ports-and-services">Open Ports and Services</h2>
<p>The Nmap scan for target revealed no open ports. This suggests that
the host may be well-hardened against external access or that critical
services are not exposed on standard ports, or the scope of the scan was
limited. Further in-depth analysis, including authenticated scans or
internal network scans, would be necessary to fully assess the host’s
vulnerability posture.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the security control questionnaire and
technical scan results, the following risks have been identified. No
pre-existing vulnerabilities were provided as part of the input
data.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and enhance the cybersecurity posture
of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, the following recommendations
are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
Workstations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Deploy and enforce MFA for all user logins to company computers
and workstations.</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluate solutions such as FIDO2 security keys, authenticator
apps, or smart cards.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Draft a comprehensive AUP that clearly outlines employee
responsibilities regarding company assets, data handling, internet
usage, and prohibited activities.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all employees review and sign the AUP annually.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Mandatory Security Awareness Training
Programs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement mandatory security awareness training for all new
employees as part of their onboarding process.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct mandatory annual security awareness training for all
employees to cover evolving threats, phishing recognition, password
hygiene, and data protection best practices.</p></li>
<li><p>Utilize engaging and relevant content, including phishing
simulations, to reinforce learning.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Advanced Network and System
Assessments:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Perform internal and authenticated vulnerability assessments of
critical systems and applications to identify misconfigurations,
unpatched software, and other weaknesses not visible from a basic
external scan.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider penetration testing to simulate real-world attacks and
validate the effectiveness of existing security controls.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Regularly Review and Update Security
Policies:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Establish a process for regular review and update of all security
policies and procedures (e.g., annually or whenever significant changes
occur).</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The assessment reveals that while the basic network scan did not
identify immediately exploitable open ports, there are significant
foundational gaps in <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>’s security
controls as evidenced by the questionnaire. Addressing the lack of MFA
for computer logins, establishing an Acceptable Use Policy, and
implementing comprehensive security awareness training are critical
first steps to building a robust security posture and mitigating a wide
array of common cyber threats. Proactive implementation of these
recommendations will significantly reduce the organization’s overall
risk exposure.</p>
