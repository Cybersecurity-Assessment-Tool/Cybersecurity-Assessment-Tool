<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on an analysis of provided
organizational data, a technical network scan, and pre-existing risk
information. Overall, the organization demonstrates strengths in
critical areas like Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across various
access points and annual security awareness training. However,
significant gaps exist in foundational security controls, specifically
the lack of an Employee Acceptable Use Policy and dedicated security
awareness training for new employees. The network scan of the specified
target found no open ports, which is a positive finding. One
pre-existing risk, an "Unencrypted Web Server," was noted, which may
require further investigation to validate its current status against the
scan findings. Recommendations are provided to address identified
vulnerabilities and enhance the overall security posture.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-security-controls">Analysis of Security
Controls</h2>
<p>The organization has implemented strong MFA requirements across
email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, which is a
commendable practice significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized
access due to compromised credentials. Regular annual security awareness
training for all employees is also a positive control.</p>
<p>However, two critical gaps were identified:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> An
AUP is fundamental for setting expectations regarding the use of
organizational IT resources, protecting company assets, and mitigating
legal and operational risks. Without one, employees may be unaware of
their responsibilities, potentially leading to misuse, data breaches, or
compliance issues.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong> While annual training is conducted, the absence of
specific training for new hires means that individuals are onboarded
without essential security knowledge from day one, exposing the
organization to risks during a critical period.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<h2 id="network-scan-findings">Network Scan Findings</h2>
<p>A network scan targeting was conducted.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not provided in input data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Target Status:</strong> Up</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports Found:</strong> None.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="detailed-analysis">Detailed Analysis</h3>
<p>The Nmap scan of <code>[Target IP]</code> reported no open ports.
Specifically, port 80 was identified as <strong>closed</strong>. This
indicates a strong perimeter security posture for the scanned target, as
there are no immediately accessible network services that could be
exploited. This is a positive finding from the perspective of external
network attack surface.</p>

</div>
<h2 id="risk-details">Risk Details</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Employee Acceptable Use Policy:</strong> This
foundational control is absent, leaving the organization vulnerable to
insider threats, data leakage, and compliance failures due to undefined
boundaries for employee conduct with IT assets.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No New Employee Security Awareness Training:</strong>
While annual training is positive, the lack of initial training for new
employees means they may operate without critical security knowledge
during their most vulnerable initial period, increasing the risk of
phishing, malware, or social engineering incidents.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pre-existing Risk: Unencrypted Web Server:</strong> The
organization’s existing risk register identifies an "Unencrypted Web
Server" with Port 80 being open. However, the current network scan
performed for this assessment found Port 80 to be
<strong>closed</strong> on the target <code>[Target IP]</code>. This
discrepancy suggests either the risk is associated with a different
asset, has been remediated since its initial identification, or the
scope of the current scan did not cover the affected asset. This risk,
if active, could lead to sensitive data exposure and
compromise.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis, the following actionable recommendations are
provided to enhance the cybersecurity posture of <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Draft a comprehensive AUP outlining appropriate use of company
devices, networks, software, and data.</p></li>
<li><p>Communicate the AUP clearly to all employees, requiring
acknowledgement of understanding.</p></li>
<li><p>Integrate the AUP into employee onboarding and ongoing training
programs.</p></li>
<li><p>Review and update the AUP annually or as organizational policies
and technologies evolve.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Introduce Mandatory Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop a dedicated security awareness module for all new hires,
to be completed within their first week of employment.</p></li>
<li><p>Cover essential topics such as phishing identification, password
hygiene, data handling, and reporting suspicious activity.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure this initial training complements the existing annual
security awareness program.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Investigate "Unencrypted Web Server" Risk
Discrepancy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Validate the scope and current status of the "Unencrypted Web
Server" risk identified in the organization’s existing
vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p>Determine if the affected element ("Port 80 is open") applies to
an asset not covered by the current network scan, or if it represents a
historical finding that has since been remediated.</p></li>
<li><p>If the risk is still active on any organizational asset, ensure
appropriate remediation (e.g., closing the port, implementing HTTPS with
valid SSL/TLS certificates) is prioritized to protect data in
transit.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Maintain Strong MFA Controls:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Continue to enforce MFA for email access, computer logins, and
sensitive data systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Regularly review MFA implementations for effectiveness and expand
coverage to other critical systems as needed.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Continue Annual Security Awareness Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Maintain the current program of annual security awareness
training for all employees to reinforce best practices and educate on
evolving threats.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p><strong>[Organization Name]</strong> demonstrates a good foundation
in critical areas like Multi-Factor Authentication and recurring
security training. However, the absence of an Employee Acceptable Use
Policy and specific training for new employees represents significant
organizational risks that could be exploited. While the network scan
provided a positive finding of no open ports on the target, the
pre-existing "Unencrypted Web Server" risk requires further
clarification and potential remediation. Addressing these identified
gaps will substantially strengthen the organization’s overall
cybersecurity posture and resilience against modern threats.</p>
