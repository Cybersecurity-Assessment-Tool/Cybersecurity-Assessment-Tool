<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture assessment for the
client organization. The assessment combines an external network scan, a
review of internal security controls via a questionnaire, and an
analysis of pre-existing risk data.</p>
<p>Overall, the external network scan revealed no immediately apparent
open ports, suggesting a potentially hardened external perimeter for the
scanned target. However, a review of internal security controls
identified significant gaps, particularly concerning Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) implementation and new employee security awareness
training. No pre-existing vulnerabilities were provided for this
assessment.</p>
<p>The identified internal control deficiencies pose a significant risk
to the organization, potentially allowing unauthorized access and
increasing the likelihood of successful social engineering attacks or
insider threats, despite a seemingly secure external network.</p>

<h3 id="identified-internal-gaps">Identified Internal Gaps</h3>
<p>Based on the questionnaire responses, several critical internal
security gaps were identified:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA to access email Control</strong>: The
organization indicated that ’Do you require MFA to access email?’ is not
implemented, leading to a significant security exposure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA to log into computers Control</strong>: The
organization indicated that ’Do you require MFA to log into computers?’
is not implemented, leading to a significant security exposure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA to access sensitive data systems
Control</strong>: The organization indicated that ’Do you require MFA to
access sensitive data systems?’ is not implemented, leading to a
significant security exposure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of security awareness training for new employees
Control</strong>: The organization indicated that ’Does your
organization do security awareness training for new employees?’ is not
implemented, leading to a significant security exposure.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These gaps indicate a lack of foundational security practices that
could significantly impact the organization’s overall security
posture.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>This section details the findings from the external network scan
performed on the target IP address.</p>
<h2 id="nmap-scan-summary">Nmap Scan Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target:</strong> <code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not provided</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Nmap scan did not identify any open ports on the target IP
address. This suggests that the external-facing network services are
either well-protected, filtered, or non-existent for the scanned target.
While this is a positive finding for the external perimeter, it does not
mitigate internal control weaknesses.</p>

<h3 id="detailed-risk-breakdown">Detailed Risk Breakdown</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Internal Control Deficiencies:</strong> The primary risks
identified stem from the lack of robust internal security controls,
particularly the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication across critical
access points and insufficient security awareness training for new
employees. These are assessed as <strong>High Severity</strong> due to
their potential for unauthorized access, data breaches, and successful
social engineering attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>External Technical Vulnerabilities:</strong> No external
technical vulnerabilities were found during the Nmap scan. This
indicates a strong external perimeter for the scanned target, though
ongoing vigilance and regular scanning are recommended.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pre-existing Vulnerabilities:</strong> No pre-existing
vulnerabilities were provided in the input data, so this assessment does
not include an evaluation of such risks.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the assessment, the following recommendations are provided
to enhance the organization’s cybersecurity posture:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Prioritize MFA implementation for email access, computer logins,
and all sensitive data systems. This is a critical control to prevent
unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised.</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluate suitable MFA solutions (e.g., authenticator apps, FIDO2
security keys) based on organizational needs and user
experience.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Enhance Security Awareness Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and implement a mandatory security awareness training
program for <em>all new employees</em> during their onboarding process.
This should cover common threats like phishing, social engineering,
password hygiene, and company policies.</p></li>
<li><p>Reinforce existing annual training with more interactive and
scenario-based modules.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Security Audits and Vulnerability
Assessments:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Conduct regular internal and external vulnerability scans to
proactively identify and remediate potential weaknesses.</p></li>
<li><p>Periodically review security policies and controls (e.g.,
acceptable use policy) to ensure they remain current and
effective.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Incident Response Planning:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop or refine an incident response plan to ensure the
organization can effectively detect, respond to, and recover from
security incidents.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct tabletop exercises to test the plan’s
effectiveness.</p></li>
</ul></li>
