<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings from a cybersecurity posture
assessment conducted for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The
assessment involved reviewing organizational security controls via a
questionnaire, analyzing network scan results, and correlating these
with known existing risks.</p>
<p>Key findings indicate critical vulnerabilities, including the
presence of an outdated FTP service allowing anonymous access on a
scanned system, a lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
sensitive data systems, and significant gaps in the organization’s
security awareness training program. Additionally, existing risks
highlight the use of End-of-Life (EOL) operating systems.</p>
<p>These issues collectively expose the organization to a high risk of
data breaches, unauthorized access, and successful social engineering
attacks. Immediate and strategic recommendations are provided to address
these deficiencies and enhance the overall security posture.</p>

</div>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-questionnaire-results">Analysis
of Questionnaire Results</h2>
<p>The questionnaire highlights critical deficiencies in multi-factor
authentication coverage and security awareness training. While MFA is
used for email and computer logins, its absence for sensitive data
systems represents a high risk, as compromised credentials could lead
directly to data exfiltration. The complete lack of security awareness
training for both new and existing employees significantly increases the
organization’s susceptibility to human-factor attacks such as phishing,
social engineering, and malware delivery.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed to identify open ports, services, and
versions running on a target system.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="scan-details">Scan Details</h2>

Vulnerabilities</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port:</strong> 21/tcp</p></li>
<li><p><strong>State:</strong> Open</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Service:</strong> FTP
(<code>vsftpd 2.3.4</code>)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Finding:</strong> The <code>vsftpd</code> service version
<code>2.3.4</code> is critically outdated, having been released in 2011.
This version is known to have several severe vulnerabilities, including
a backdoor vulnerability (CVE-2011-2523) that allows arbitrary command
execution with root privileges.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Additional Finding:</strong> The Nmap script
<code>ftp-anon</code> reported . This misconfiguration allows
unauthenticated users to access the FTP server, potentially exposing
sensitive files or enabling unauthorized file uploads, further
exacerbating the risk posed by the outdated service version.</p></li>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and improve the overall
cybersecurity posture, the following recommendations are provided. These
are categorized for immediate action, strategic planning, and policy
refinement.</p>

<li><p>Immediately disable anonymous FTP access on any systems running
<code>vsftpd</code> or similar FTP services.</p></li>
<li><p>Patch <code>vsftpd</code> to a current, secure version, or
preferably, decommission FTP if not essential. Replace with a secure
file transfer protocol (e.g., SFTP, SCP, FTPS) with strong
authentication and encryption.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement strict access controls and ensure that only
authenticated, authorized users can access necessary resources.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong></p>

that process or store sensitive organizational data. This should be a
top priority to protect against credential theft and unauthorized
access.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Comprehensive Security Awareness Training
Program:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and implement a mandatory security awareness training
program for all new employees during their onboarding process.</p></li>

employees to keep them informed about current threats and best practices
(e.g., phishing recognition, password hygiene, incident
reporting).</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="strategic-actions-mediumlong-term">Strategic Actions
(Medium/Long-term)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Operating System Upgrade Plan:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and execute a detailed plan to upgrade all Windows 7
workstations to a currently supported and more secure operating system
(e.g., Windows 10/11 or a supported Linux distribution). Prioritize
systems that handle sensitive data or have network exposure.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement a robust patch management system to ensure all
operating systems and applications are kept up-to-date with the latest
security patches.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Software Audits:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement a process for regularly auditing all deployed software
and services to identify outdated versions, unpatched vulnerabilities,
and insecure configurations.</p></li>
<li><p>Utilize vulnerability scanners and asset management tools to
maintain an up-to-date inventory of all software and their respective
versions.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="policy-process-improvements">Policy &amp; Process
Improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Review and Update Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ensure the AUP is current and comprehensively covers secure
system usage, data handling, password policies, and procedures for
reporting security incidents.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all employees acknowledge and understand the AUP.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Incident Response Planning:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop or refine the organization’s incident response plan to
ensure clear procedures are in place for detecting, containing,
eradicating, and recovering from security incidents, especially those
related to unauthorized access or data breaches.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct regular tabletop exercises to test the effectiveness of
the incident response plan.</p></li>
