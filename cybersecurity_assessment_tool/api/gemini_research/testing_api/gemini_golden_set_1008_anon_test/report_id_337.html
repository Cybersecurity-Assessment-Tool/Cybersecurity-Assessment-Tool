id="cybersecurity-posture-assessment-report">Cybersecurity Posture
Assessment Report</h1>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="overview">1. Overview</h2>
<p>The organization currently exhibits a weak cybersecurity posture,
primarily due to a complete absence of fundamental security controls
identified through a questionnaire, coupled with critical
vulnerabilities discovered during a network scan. Key findings include a
widespread lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), no established
acceptable use policy or security awareness training, and the use of an
End-of-Life (EOL) web server (Nginx 1.18.0) exposed on the internet.
These issues present significant attack vectors and necessitate urgent
remediation to mitigate potential breaches and maintain operational
integrity.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="organizational-information">2. Organizational

updates, leaving it highly susceptible to publicly known vulnerabilities
and exploits. This poses a critical risk to the availability, integrity,
and confidentiality of the service and the underlying system.</p></li>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment">5. Risk Assessment</h2>
<p>Based on the security control review and technical scan results, the
following risks have been identified. No pre-existing risks were
provided for correlation in the input data.</p>

</tr>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Outdated Web Server (Nginx
1.18.0)</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Critical</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The web server running on port 443 is an
End-of-Life (EOL) version (Nginx 1.18.0). EOL software does not receive
security patches, leaving it exposed to publicly known vulnerabilities
and increasing the likelihood of successful exploitation, potentially
leading to denial of service, data breaches, or full system
compromise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Lack of Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA)</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Critical</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">MFA is not required for email access,
computer logins, or sensitive data systems. This significantly increases
the risk of unauthorized access through credential theft (e.g.,
phishing, brute-force attacks), as a single compromised password could
grant access to critical organizational resources.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>No Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP)</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">High</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The absence of an Acceptable Use Policy
means employees lack clear guidelines regarding appropriate use of
organizational IT assets and data. This can lead to increased security
incidents, data leakage, and compliance issues due to unawareness or
unintentional misuse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>No Security Awareness
Training</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">High</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Neither new nor existing employees receive
regular security awareness training. Employees are often the weakest
link in an organization’s security chain. Without proper training, they
are more susceptible to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing,
pretexting), malware, and other human-centric threats, increasing the
risk of breaches and data loss.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>No Pre-existing Risks
Identified</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Low</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">No existing vulnerabilities or risks were

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">6. Recommendations</h2>
<p>To address the identified risks and significantly improve the
organization’s cybersecurity posture, the following actionable
recommendations are provided, prioritized by severity:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade/Patch Nginx Server (Critical
Priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Immediately upgrade Nginx to the latest stable version (e.g.,
Nginx 1.26.x or 1.24.x LTS) to ensure all known security vulnerabilities
are patched.</p></li>
<li><p>Alternatively, consider migrating to a currently supported web
server platform if an upgrade is not immediately feasible or desired due
to compatibility or other constraints.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement a robust, regular patching and update management
process for all internet-facing services and critical systems to
maintain security hygiene.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) (Critical
Priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mandate and enforce MFA for all critical access points, including
email systems, computer logins, VPNs, and sensitive data
applications.</p></li>
<li><p>Prioritize MFA implementation for administrators and users with
access to highly sensitive assets or critical infrastructure.</p></li>
<li><p>Educate all users on the importance and effective use of MFA to
minimize resistance and maximize adoption rates.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)
(High Priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Draft a comprehensive AUP that clearly outlines employee
responsibilities, acceptable and unacceptable use of company IT assets,
networks, and data.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all employees read, understand, and formally acknowledge
the AUP upon hiring and periodically thereafter, typically during annual
reviews.</p></li>
<li><p>Regularly review and update the AUP to reflect changes in
technology, organizational policies, and the evolving threat
landscape.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish a Comprehensive Security Awareness Training
Program (High Priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement mandatory security awareness training for all new hires
as part of their onboarding process to instill security-conscious
behavior from day one.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct annual (or more frequent) refresher security awareness
training for all existing employees, covering current threats such as
phishing, ransomware, social engineering, and secure data handling
practices.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider conducting simulated phishing campaigns regularly to
test employee vigilance and reinforce training concepts in a practical,
real-world scenario.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Regular Vulnerability Scanning and Penetration
Testing (Ongoing):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement a routine schedule for automated vulnerability scanning
of both internal and external assets to proactively identify weaknesses
before they can be exploited.</p></li>
<li><p>Engage third-party experts to conduct periodic penetration tests,
simulating real-world attacks to identify exploitable vulnerabilities
and validate the effectiveness of existing security controls.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Test an Incident Response Plan (High
Priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create and maintain a clear, well-documented incident response
plan (IRP) that outlines procedures for detecting, containing,
eradicating, recovering from, and post-incident analysis of security
breaches.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct regular tabletop exercises and simulations to test the
IRP’s effectiveness, identify gaps, and ensure the response team is
well-prepared to handle various incident scenarios.</p></li>
