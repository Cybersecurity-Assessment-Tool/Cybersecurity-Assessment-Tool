<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">1. Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings from a cybersecurity assessment
conducted for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The assessment
involved reviewing existing organizational security controls via a
questionnaire, conducting a network scan, and analyzing current known
risks. While some foundational security practices are in place, several
critical gaps and high-severity vulnerabilities were identified. Key
findings include the use of outdated web server software, a lack of
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins, and insufficient
security awareness training for new employees. Immediate attention to
these areas is highly recommended to significantly enhance the
organization’s security posture and reduce potential attack vectors.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="technical-analysis">4.1 Technical
Analysis</h2>
<p>The Nginx web server detected on port 443 with version 1.18.0 is a
significant concern. Nginx 1.18.0 was released in April 2020 and has
since reached its End-of-Life (EOL) status. This means it no longer
receives official security updates or bug fixes, leaving it vulnerable
to publicly known exploits and newly discovered vulnerabilities. Running
EOL software significantly increases the attack surface and poses a high
risk to the availability, integrity, and confidentiality of the web
service and potentially the entire system it resides on.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment">5. Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the security control review and technical scan, the
following risks have been identified and assessed. No pre-existing
vulnerabilities were provided in the input data.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">6. Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and enhance the overall
cybersecurity posture of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, the
following actionable recommendations are provided.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade/Patch Outdated Web Server Software:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Immediately upgrade Nginx to the latest stable version (e.g.,
Nginx 1.26.x) to ensure all known security vulnerabilities are patched.
Review official Nginx documentation for the recommended upgrade
path:</p></li>
<li><p>Establish and adhere to a regular patching and update schedule
for all server software, operating systems, and applications.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider implementing a Web Application Firewall (WAF) as an
additional layer of protection to filter malicious traffic.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer
Logins:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mandate MFA for all computer logins across the organization,
including workstations and servers, wherever technically
feasible.</p></li>
<li><p>Explore and deploy MFA solutions such as hardware tokens,
software authenticators (e.g., Google Authenticator, Microsoft
Authenticator), or biometric authentication integrated with existing
identity providers (e.g., Active Directory, Azure AD).</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct comprehensive user training on how to use MFA and educate
employees on its critical role in preventing unauthorized
access.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Comprehensive Security Awareness Training for
New Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and implement a mandatory security awareness training
program specifically for all new employees as a foundational component
of their onboarding process.</p></li>
<li><p>The training should cover essential topics such as phishing and
social engineering recognition, strong password hygiene, data handling
policies, acceptable use policies, and incident reporting
procedures.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure the training content is engaging, up-to-date with current
threat landscapes, and regularly reviewed for effectiveness.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">7. Conclusion</h1>
<p>This assessment highlights several critical areas requiring immediate
attention within <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>’s cybersecurity
landscape. Addressing the outdated web server software, implementing
robust MFA for computer logins, and enhancing new employee security
awareness training are fundamental steps that will significantly
strengthen the organization’s defense against modern cyber threats.
Proactive engagement with these recommendations will foster a more
secure operating environment and protect valuable organizational
assets.</p>
