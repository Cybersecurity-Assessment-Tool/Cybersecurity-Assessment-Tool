<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">1. Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on a review of
organizational security controls, an analysis of network scan data, and
an assessment of current reported risks. Key findings indicate critical
gaps in multi-factor authentication (MFA) implementation for computer
logins and a lack of consistent annual security awareness training for
employees. While network scan data revealed an open port 8080 displaying
a potentially sensitive HTTP title ("TOP SECRET DB"), existing risk
registers classify this specific finding as secured and a false
positive. Recommendations are provided to address identified
vulnerabilities and enhance overall security.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="control-gaps-identified">3.1. Control Gaps
Identified</h2>
<p>Based on the questionnaire responses, the following critical security
control gaps were identified:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins:</strong> Critical
systems and user workstations may be vulnerable to credential stuffing
or stolen credential attacks without the additional layer of MFA. This
significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials
are compromised.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inadequate Annual Security Awareness Training:</strong>
Infrequent or absent annual training leaves employees susceptible to
evolving phishing, social engineering, and other cyber threats. A
well-trained workforce is a critical defense layer against many types of
attacks.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">4. Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed to identify open ports and services on
the target system. Details regarding the scan and key findings are
presented below.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="scan-details">4.1. Scan Details</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong></p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port ID:</strong> 8080</p></li>
<li><p><strong>State:</strong> Open</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Observed Service/Information:</strong> HTTP (title: "TOP
SECRET DB")</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Details:</strong> An HTTP service was found running on
port 8080, publicly exposing an HTTP title "TOP SECRET DB". While the
exact service and version were not identified by the basic scan, the
presence of such a title on an open port is a significant concern for
information disclosure and potential unauthorized access, unless
specifically intended, tightly controlled, and adequately
secured.</p></li>

technical scans with pre-existing risk information.</p>

<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of MFA for Computer Login</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Without Multi-Factor Authentication for
computer access, the compromise of a single set of user credentials

</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Inadequate Annual Security Awareness
Training</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Employees who do not receive regular (at
least annual) security awareness training are more susceptible to social
engineering attacks, phishing campaigns, and may not adhere to current
security policies, significantly increasing human-factor risk.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Exposed Sensitive Information on Port 8080
(Acknowledged as "Secured")</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">A public-facing port 8080 displaying the
HTTP title "TOP SECRET DB" was observed during the scan. While existing
organizational risk registers classify "Port 8080 Secured" as a false
positive with a CVSS score of 0.0 (as per Input 3), the direct
observation from the scan warrants re-verification to ensure no
sensitive information is inadvertently exposed or that the previous
assessment remains fully valid and effective.</td>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">6. Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis, the following actionable recommendations are
provided to improve the organization’s cybersecurity posture:</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="immediate-actions">6.1. Immediate
Actions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Logins:</strong> Mandate and
enforce Multi-Factor Authentication for all computer logins, especially
for administrative accounts and access to critical internal systems.
This significantly reduces the risk associated with compromised
credentials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mandate Annual Security Awareness Training:</strong>
Establish and enforce a mandatory annual security awareness training
program for all employees. Training should cover current threat
landscapes, phishing recognition, secure browsing habits, and
organizational security policies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Re-verify Port 8080 Configuration and Security:</strong>
Despite existing risk assessments, conduct an immediate re-evaluation of
the service running on port 8080. Confirm that the "TOP SECRET DB" title
is not exposing actual sensitive information and that the port is
adequately secured, filtered, or otherwise inaccessible from
unauthorized sources. If it remains classified as a false positive,
ensure that the reasoning and compensating controls are clearly
documented and robust.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="long-term-strategy">6.2. Long-Term
Strategy</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Regular Security Control Audits:</strong> Conduct
periodic internal and external audits of all security controls to ensure
continuous compliance, effectiveness, and alignment with evolving threat
landscapes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Continuous Vulnerability Management:</strong> Implement a
continuous vulnerability scanning and management program coupled with
regular penetration testing to proactively identify and address
technical weaknesses across the IT infrastructure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Incident Response Planning:</strong> Develop, test, and
regularly update an incident response plan to ensure the organization
can effectively detect, respond to, and recover from cybersecurity
incidents.</p></li>
