<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on an analysis of network
scan data, organizational security questionnaire responses, and existing
risk intelligence. The assessment reveals several critical findings that
require immediate attention. Primarily, the exposure of Remote Desktop
Protocol (RDP) directly to the internet constitutes a severe attack
surface, correlating with an identified high-severity risk.
Additionally, a significant gap exists in the implementation of
multi-factor authentication (MFA) for computer logins, increasing the
risk of unauthorized access. While foundational security controls like
security awareness training and acceptable use policies are in place,
these critical gaps could severely undermine the overall security
posture and lead to potential breaches.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-security-controls">Analysis of
Security Controls</h2>
<p>The organization demonstrates a commendable foundation in security
awareness and policy enforcement, with an acceptable use policy and
regular security training programs in place for all employees.
Furthermore, the implementation of MFA for email and sensitive data
systems is a strong positive. However, a critical gap is identified in
the lack of MFA for computer logins. This absence significantly elevates
the risk of unauthorized access to internal systems if user credentials
are compromised, potentially leading to broader network compromise and
data exfiltration.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was conducted on the designated target to identify
open ports, services, and potential vulnerabilities. The following

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="technical-analysis">Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>The Nmap scan revealed that TCP port 3389 is open, indicating an
active Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) listener identified as
‘ms-wbt-server‘. Direct exposure of RDP to the internet is universally
recognized as a high-risk vulnerability. Threat actors frequently target
exposed RDP services for initial access, employing brute-force attacks,
credential stuffing, or exploiting known RDP vulnerabilities. Without
robust compensating controls such as MFA, strong password policies, IP
whitelisting, or mandating VPN usage for remote access, this open port
represents a severe attack surface that could lead to unauthorized
system access, data compromise, or ransomware deployment.</p>

</div>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="detailed-risk-breakdown">Detailed Risk
Breakdown</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>RDP Exposure (Critical):</strong> This risk was
explicitly confirmed by the network scan results, showing port 3389 open
and the ‘ms-wbt-server‘ service running. This finding directly
correlates with the pre-existing risk intelligence entry for "RDP
Exposure" with a CVSS score of 9.0, highlighting its critical nature.
Attackers constantly scan for and attempt to exploit exposed RDP
services. Successful exploitation can grant full control over the
compromised system and facilitate lateral movement within the
network.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Computer Login (High):</strong>
Identified through the security questionnaire, the absence of MFA for
computer logins represents a high-severity security gap. In an era where
phishing and credential theft are rampant, single-factor authentication
(username and password) is insufficient to protect against unauthorized
access. An attacker with compromised credentials could easily bypass
security and gain access to an employee’s workstation, potentially
accessing sensitive data or launching further attacks from within the
network.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actionable recommendations are provided to address the
identified risks and significantly enhance the overall cybersecurity
posture of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="immediate-actions-high-priority">Immediate Actions (High
Priority)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Secure RDP Access:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Block Direct Internet Access:</strong> Immediately block
direct internet access to RDP (TCP port 3389) on all perimeter
firewalls.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement VPN for Remote Access:</strong> Mandate the use
of a Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution for all remote RDP access.
Users should connect to the VPN before attempting to establish an RDP
session.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enforce Strong Authentication:</strong> For any internal
RDP access, ensure strong, unique passwords are enforced, and ideally,
integrate with an identity provider that supports MFA.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Monitor RDP Logs:</strong> Regularly review RDP
authentication logs for any suspicious or failed login
attempts.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Logins:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Deploy MFA Solution:</strong> Research, select, and
deploy a Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) solution for all computer
logins across the organization. This should be a top priority,
especially for administrative accounts and systems with access to
sensitive data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Phased Rollout:</strong> Consider a phased rollout
starting with high-privilege users, followed by all employees.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mid-term-actions-medium-priority">Mid-Term Actions (Medium
Priority)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Regular Vulnerability Scanning:</strong> Establish a
schedule for regular internal and external vulnerability scanning to
proactively identify new exposures, misconfigurations, and outdated
software versions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Robust Patch Management:</strong> Ensure a comprehensive
patch management program is in place for all operating systems,
applications, and network devices to promptly address known
vulnerabilities and reduce the attack surface.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Security Awareness Training Reinforcement:</strong>
Reinforce security awareness training with specific emphasis on the
dangers of phishing, social engineering, credential theft, and the
importance of MFA.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="long-term-actions-lower-priority-foundational">Long-Term Actions
(Lower Priority, Foundational)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Develop Incident Response Plan:</strong> Create and
regularly test a comprehensive incident response plan to ensure the
organization can effectively detect, respond to, contain, and recover
from security incidents.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Security Information and Event Management
(SIEM):</strong> Consider implementing a SIEM solution to centralize log
collection, improve real-time threat detection capabilities, and
facilitate security monitoring and forensics.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>While <strong>[Organization Name]</strong> has established several
foundational security practices, the direct exposure of RDP to the
internet and the absence of MFA for computer logins represent critical
vulnerabilities that pose an immediate and significant threat.
Addressing these high-priority risks with the recommended immediate
actions will substantially improve the organization’s security posture
and resilience against common cyber threats. Continuous vigilance,
proactive security measures, and adherence to evolving cybersecurity
best practices are paramount for safeguarding organizational assets and
data in the long term.</p>
