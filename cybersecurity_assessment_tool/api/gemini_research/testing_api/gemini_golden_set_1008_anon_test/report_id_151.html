<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings from a cybersecurity posture
assessment conducted for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The
assessment involved reviewing organizational security controls via a
questionnaire, analyzing network scan data, and evaluating existing
risks. While some foundational controls are in place (e.g., MFA for
email and computer login, new employee training), critical gaps were
identified concerning Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for sensitive
data systems, the absence of an Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP),
and a lack of consistent annual security awareness training for all
employees. A network scan identified an open SSH (port 22) service on
<code>[Target IP]</code>, which represents a potential attack surface.
These findings, combined with the absence of specific known
vulnerabilities at the time of assessment, indicate a moderate overall
risk posture that requires immediate attention to strengthen critical
security controls and reduce potential exposure.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of Technical
Findings</h2>
<p>The discovery of port 22 (SSH) being open indicates that the system
is configured to accept Secure Shell connections. While SSH is a
legitimate and encrypted protocol used for remote administration, its
exposure can introduce risk if not properly secured (e.g., strong
passwords, key-based authentication, restricted access, regular
patching). Without specific version information, it is impossible to
determine if the SSH server is running outdated or vulnerable
software.</p>

(AUP):</strong> Create a comprehensive AUP that clearly outlines
employee responsibilities and acceptable conduct regarding
organizational IT resources. Ensure all employees acknowledge and
understand this policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Annual Security Awareness Training
Program:</strong> Implement a mandatory, recurring security awareness
training program for all employees, conducted at least once per year, to
keep them informed about current threats and best practices.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="intermediate-actions-medium-priority">Intermediate Actions
(Medium Priority)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Harden SSH Service on
<code>[Target IP]</code>:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Review and update the SSH server software to the latest stable
version to mitigate known vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p>Enforce strong, key-based authentication and disable
password-based login if possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement IP-based access restrictions to allow SSH connections
only from trusted administrative networks.</p></li>
<li><p>Monitor SSH logs for suspicious activity and failed login
attempts.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider changing the default SSH port (22) to a non-standard
port to deter automated scanning.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Regular Vulnerability Scanning:</strong>
Implement a schedule for periodic vulnerability scanning of all
internet-facing assets to proactively identify and address potential
weaknesses.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p><strong>[Organization Name]</strong> demonstrates a foundational
understanding of security by implementing MFA for email and computer
logins and providing initial security awareness training. However, the
identified gaps in MFA for sensitive data, the absence of an AUP, and
insufficient recurring security training pose significant risks that
could lead to data breaches or operational disruptions. The open SSH
port further highlights the need for a comprehensive approach to
securing external-facing services. By promptly addressing these
recommendations, <strong>[Organization Name]</strong> can substantially
improve its security posture and reduce its overall risk exposure.</p>
