<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report presents a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, synthesizing data from a
network scan, an organizational security questionnaire, and pre-existing
risk information.</p>
<p>The analysis reveals a concerning security landscape characterized by
critical technical exposures and significant deficiencies in
foundational security controls. Specifically, an open Remote Desktop
Protocol (RDP) port (<code>3389</code>) was identified on the target
system, a vulnerability explicitly noted as critical in the
organization’s existing risk register. Furthermore, the questionnaire
responses highlighted a complete absence of Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) for email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, alongside
a lack of essential security policies (e.g., Acceptable Use Policy) and
employee security awareness training.</p>
<p>These findings collectively point to a <strong>High-Critical</strong>
overall risk posture, indicating a substantial likelihood of compromise
through common attack vectors, further exacerbated by weak internal
controls. Urgent and strategic recommendations are provided to address
these critical gaps, beginning with immediate hardening of external
access points and progressing to foundational improvements in policy,
training, and authentication mechanisms.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-security-control-review">Analysis
of Security Control Review</h2>
<p>The responses indicate a complete absence of several fundamental
cybersecurity controls. The lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
across all critical access points (email, computer logins, and sensitive
data systems) significantly increases the organization’s vulnerability
to credential-based attacks, such as phishing and brute-forcing. Without
MFA, a single compromised password can lead to unauthorized access to
critical systems and data.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the absence of an employee acceptable use policy and
regular security awareness training (for both new and existing
employees) suggests a significant gap in human-centric security. This
lack of policy and education makes the organization highly susceptible
to social engineering, insider threats, and accidental data breaches due
to unaware or untrained personnel.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was conducted by <code>nmap</code> on
<code>[Target IP]</code> (Scan Date: <code>[Scan Date]</code>). The
following services were identified as active and exposed:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP:</strong> <code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> <code>[Scan Date]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports and Services:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port:</strong> <code>3389/tcp</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Service:</strong> <code>ms-wbt-server</code> (Remote
Desktop Protocol - RDP)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Product/Version:</strong> Not identified by
scan.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-technical-scan-results">Analysis
of Technical Scan Results</h2>
<p>The primary technical finding is the exposure of Remote Desktop
Protocol (RDP) on port <code>3389/tcp</code>. RDP is a widely used
remote access service but is also a frequent target for cyber attackers.
Attackers often attempt to gain unauthorized access via RDP through:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Brute-force attacks:</strong> Guessing
credentials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Credential stuffing:</strong> Using leaked credentials
from other breaches.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Exploitation of RDP vulnerabilities:</strong> Targeting
known weaknesses in the RDP service or client.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The absence of specific product or version information from the scan
limits the ability to identify known vulnerabilities directly, but the
sheer exposure of RDP without any noted protective measures (such as VPN
integration or IP restrictions) constitutes a significant risk. This
risk is compounded by the lack of MFA for computer logins identified in
the security control review, making credential-based attacks against
this RDP endpoint more likely to succeed.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="overall-risk-posture">Overall Risk
Posture</h2>
<p>The current cybersecurity posture of <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong> is assessed as <strong>High-Critical</strong>. The
combination of an exposed RDP service (a known critical attack surface)
with a pervasive absence of Multi-Factor Authentication across all key
access points creates an extremely vulnerable environment. This
technical exposure, coupled with fundamental gaps in security policies
and employee training, significantly increases the likelihood of a
successful cyberattack, leading to unauthorized access, data breaches,
and potential operational disruption. Addressing these interlinked risks
comprehensively and systematically is essential to prevent significant
security incidents.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To effectively mitigate the identified risks and enhance the overall
cybersecurity posture, the following actionable recommendations are
provided. These are categorized by their urgency and strategic
importance.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="immediate-actions-within-1-7-days">Immediate
Actions (Within 1-7 Days)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Block External RDP Access:</strong> Configure network
firewalls to immediately block all external (Internet-facing) incoming
connections to port <code>3389</code> on <code>[Target IP]</code>. If
RDP access is absolutely essential for specific business operations,
restrict it to only known, whitelisted trusted IP addresses (e.g., from
a corporate VPN gateway).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="short-term-actions-within-1-3-months">Short-Term Actions (Within 1-3
Months)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email:</strong> Deploy and enforce
Multi-Factor Authentication for all employee email accounts. This should
be a top priority for protecting against phishing and credential
stuffing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Login:</strong> Roll out and
enforce Multi-Factor Authentication for all user computer logins,
particularly for administrative accounts and systems processing
sensitive data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong>
Mandate Multi-Factor Authentication for access to all systems that
store, process, or transmit sensitive organizational or customer
data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Secure RDP Access with VPN:</strong> For any remaining
necessary remote RDP access, mandate the use of a Virtual Private
Network (VPN) connection. Ensure the VPN itself is secured with strong
authentication, preferably MFA. This places RDP behind an additional
layer of security.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="long-term-strategic-actions-within-3-12-months">Long-Term Strategic
Actions (Within 3-12 Months)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a comprehensive AUP that clearly outlines
employee responsibilities for using organizational IT resources, data
handling procedures, and security expectations. Ensure all employees
formally acknowledge and understand this policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish New Employee Security Awareness
Training:</strong> Implement a mandatory and robust security awareness
training program for all new hires. This training should cover essential
topics such as phishing identification, strong password practices, data
classification and handling, and social engineering tactics.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Annual Security Awareness Training for All
Employees:</strong> Develop and execute a recurring annual security
awareness training program for all employees. This will reinforce best
practices, update staff on new and evolving threats, and maintain a high
level of security consciousness.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Review and Harden RDP Configurations:</strong> Conduct a
thorough review of RDP server configurations. Implement security best
practices such as enabling Network Level Authentication (NLA),
configuring strong account lockout policies, disabling unnecessary
features (e.g., clipboard sharing, drive redirection), and ensuring
regular patching and updates of the RDP service. Consider least
privilege access for RDP users.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Vulnerability Scanning and Penetration
Testing:</strong> Establish a routine schedule for internal and external
vulnerability scanning. Complement this with periodic penetration
testing conducted by independent third parties to identify and remediate
new or evolving security weaknesses proactively.</p></li>
