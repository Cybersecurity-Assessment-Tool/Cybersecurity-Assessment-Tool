<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on an analysis of network
scan data, organizational security questionnaire responses, and existing
risk registers. The assessment reveals several critical vulnerabilities
and security gaps, primarily concerning database security, multi-factor
authentication (MFA) for sensitive systems, and foundational security
policies and training. A public-facing MySQL instance running an
End-of-Life (EOL) version presents an immediate and severe risk.
Additionally, the lack of MFA for sensitive data access, absence of an
Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), and insufficient annual security awareness
training expose the organization to significant operational and
reputational risks. Urgent recommendations are provided to address these
findings and enhance the overall security posture.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-questionnaire-findings">Analysis
of Questionnaire Findings:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA Gaps (SC-03):</strong> While MFA is in place for
email and computer login, the lack of MFA for access to sensitive data
systems is a critical vulnerability. This omission significantly
increases the risk of unauthorized access to proprietary or regulated
information should user credentials be compromised.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Policy Deficiencies (SC-04):</strong> The absence of an
employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) signifies a fundamental gap in
governance. An AUP sets expectations for employee conduct regarding
technology use, helping to mitigate insider threats and ensure
compliance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Insufficient Ongoing Training (SC-06):</strong> Although
new employees receive security awareness training, the lack of annual
refreshers for all employees leaves the workforce susceptible to
evolving threats like sophisticated phishing attacks, social
engineering, and malware.</p></li>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed to identify open ports and
services accessible from the internet. The target for this scan was the

</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of
Technical Findings:</h2>
<p>The most significant finding from the network scan is the exposure of
a MySQL database service (port 3306) to the network. Crucially, the
identified version, MySQL 5.7.33, is End-of-Life (EOL) as of October
2023. Running EOL software means there will be no further security
updates, patches, or bug fixes, making this service extremely vulnerable
to known and future exploits. This direct exposure, coupled with
outdated software, constitutes a severe security risk.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the combined analysis of the security questionnaire,
technical scan, and existing risk register, the following high-priority
risks have been identified:</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="detailed-risk-breakdown">Detailed Risk
Breakdown:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>RA-01: Publicly Exposed EOL Database (CVSS 7.5 -
High/Critical)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Overview:</strong> MySQL port 3306 is open to the
network, and the service is running an End-of-Life (EOL) version
(5.7.33). This combines the risks of direct internet exposure with
unpatched vulnerabilities, making the database a prime target for
attackers. Data breaches, unauthorized access, and denial-of-service are
highly probable outcomes if exploited.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Correlation:</strong> This risk directly correlates with
the "Database Exposure" noted in the existing risk register (Input 3)
and is exacerbated by the technical scan’s discovery of the specific EOL
version (Input 1).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>RA-02: Inadequate MFA for Sensitive Data
(High)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Overview:</strong> The absence of Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for accessing systems containing sensitive data
significantly elevates the risk of account compromise. Stolen or guessed
credentials could grant attackers direct access to critical information,
leading to data breaches, compliance violations, and reputational
damage.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Correlation:</strong> Derived directly from the
questionnaire response (Input 2, SC-03).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>RA-03: Lack of Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(Medium)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Overview:</strong> Without a clear Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP), employees may inadvertently or intentionally misuse
organizational IT resources, creating security vulnerabilities, legal
liabilities, and productivity losses. This lack of clear guidelines
increases the risk of insider threats and non-compliance with industry
standards.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Correlation:</strong> Derived directly from the
questionnaire response (Input 2, SC-04).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>RA-04: Insufficient Ongoing Security Training
(Medium)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Overview:</strong> Relying solely on new-hire security
awareness training leaves the organization vulnerable as threats evolve
rapidly. Without regular updates, employees may fall victim to new
social engineering techniques, phishing campaigns, or malware, serving
as an unwitting entry point for attackers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Correlation:</strong> Derived directly from the
questionnaire response (Input 2, SC-06).</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following recommendations are provided to mitigate the identified
risks and enhance the overall cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="database-security-addressing-ra-01">Database Security
(Addressing RA-01)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Action: Restrict Network Access (Easy
Fix):</strong> Implement strict firewall rules to block all external
access to port 3306 (MySQL). Only allow connections from trusted
internal IP addresses or specific hosts that genuinely require access.
If external access is critical, consider moving to more secure methods
(see long-term fix).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Urgent Upgrade: Migrate/Upgrade EOL MySQL
Version:</strong> Immediately plan and execute an upgrade or migration
of the MySQL database from version 5.7.33 to a currently supported and
stable release (e.g., MySQL 8.0 or newer). This is critical for
receiving ongoing security patches and vulnerability fixes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Long-Term Fix: Implement Secure Remote Access
(VPN/SSH):</strong> For any legitimate external access requirements,
enforce the use of a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or SSH tunneling.
This encrypts traffic and prevents direct exposure of the database
service to the public internet.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Security Hardening:</strong> Review and implement
database-specific security best practices, including strong password
policies, principle of least privilege for database users, and regular
security audits of the database configuration.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2
id="multi-factor-authentication-mfa-implementation-addressing-ra-02">Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) Implementation (Addressing RA-02)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Mandate MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong>
Implement and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication for all systems and
applications that handle or store sensitive organizational data. This
should be a top priority to protect against credential theft.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Policy Update:</strong> Update relevant security policies
to explicitly state the requirement for MFA across all critical and
sensitive systems.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="policy-development-and-enforcement-addressing-ra-03">Policy
Development and Enforcement (Addressing RA-03)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a comprehensive AUP that clearly outlines
acceptable and unacceptable use of company IT resources, internet,
email, and mobile devices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Employee Acknowledgment:</strong> Ensure all employees
read, understand, and formally acknowledge the AUP upon hiring and
periodically thereafter.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ongoing-security-awareness-training-addressing-ra-04">Ongoing
Security Awareness Training (Addressing RA-04)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Mandatory Annual Security Awareness Training:</strong>
Establish a program for mandatory, recurring (at least annual) security
awareness training for all employees. This training should cover current
threats such as phishing, social engineering, malware, and data handling
best practices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Updates:</strong> Ensure training materials are
regularly updated to reflect the latest cybersecurity threats and best
practices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Phishing Simulations:</strong> Consider implementing
regular simulated phishing exercises to test employee vigilance and
provide targeted training.</p></li>
</ul>
