<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on an analysis of network
scan data, an organizational security questionnaire, and existing risk
documentation. The assessment reveals a generally cautious external
posture with no open ports found on the scanned target. However,
significant internal security gaps were identified, including the lack
of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for sensitive data systems and the
absence of security awareness training for new employees. A previously
documented risk regarding an unencrypted web server was also reviewed,
with recent scan data indicating Port 80 is currently closed, suggesting
a potential remediation or changed state. Immediate attention is
recommended for the identified internal control deficiencies.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis, the following actionable recommendations are
provided to enhance the cybersecurity posture of <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong>
Immediately implement and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication for all
systems containing or providing access to sensitive organizational data.
This control is fundamental for credential protection and will
significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access via compromised
credentials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish New Employee Security Awareness
Training:</strong> Develop and implement a mandatory security awareness
training program for all new employees. This training should be
completed as part of their onboarding process and cover critical topics
such as acceptable use policies, phishing awareness, password best
practices, and secure data handling procedures.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Validate and Address Historical Risks:</strong>
Thoroughly investigate the documented "Unencrypted Web Server" risk.
Confirm if this vulnerability was successfully remediated, or if it
pertains to another system not included in the scope of the recent
network scan. Ensure that any current or future web services are
deployed with HTTPS/TLS encryption to protect data in transit.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Regular Security Reviews:</strong> Implement a
schedule for regular internal and external security assessments,
including vulnerability scans and penetration tests. These proactive
measures are crucial for continuously identifying and addressing
potential weaknesses before they can be exploited.</p></li>
