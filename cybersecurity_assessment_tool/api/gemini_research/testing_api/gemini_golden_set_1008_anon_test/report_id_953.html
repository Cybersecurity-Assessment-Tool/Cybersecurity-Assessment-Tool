<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings from a cybersecurity posture
assessment for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The assessment
involved reviewing organizational security controls, analyzing network
scan data, and correlating with existing risk information.</p>
<p>Key findings indicate critical vulnerabilities related to Remote
Desktop Protocol (RDP) exposure, confirmed by network scans and
pre-existing risk data. Additionally, significant gaps were identified
in foundational security practices, specifically regarding Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for email access and consistent annual security
awareness training for all employees. Addressing these areas is
paramount to enhancing the overall security posture and significantly
reducing the organization’s attack surface against common cyber
threats.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-security-controls">Analysis of Security
Controls</h2>
<p>The organization demonstrates good practice in requiring MFA for
computer logins and sensitive data systems, as well as having an
acceptable use policy and initial security awareness training for new
hires. However, two significant gaps were identified that represent
substantial risks:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Email Access:</strong> Email remains a
primary vector for phishing and account compromise. The absence of MFA
on email accounts significantly increases the risk of unauthorized
access, data breaches, and business email compromise (BEC)
attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training:</strong>
While new employees receive training, ongoing annual training is crucial
to ensure all employees are consistently informed about evolving
threats, social engineering tactics, and organizational security
policies. This gap leaves the workforce vulnerable to sophisticated
attacks.</p></li>

<h2 id="technical-analysis">Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>The presence of an open port 3389, associated with Microsoft Remote
Desktop Protocol (RDP), is a critical finding. RDP is a frequent target
for brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, and exploitation,
especially when exposed directly to the internet without proper layered
security controls such as a Virtual Private Network (VPN), strong
Multi-Factor Authentication, or strict IP whitelisting. The lack of
specific version information prevents an assessment of known RDP
vulnerabilities, but the mere exposure of this service constitutes a
high-risk configuration. This technical finding directly correlates with
an existing critical risk documented by the organization ("RDP
Exposure").</p>

<p>This section consolidates all identified risks, combining gaps from
the security control review, technical scan findings, and pre-existing
vulnerabilities documented by the organization.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following recommendations are provided to mitigate the identified
risks and enhance <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>’s overall
cybersecurity posture. Prioritizing these actions will lead to a
substantial reduction in the organization’s attack surface and improve
resilience against common cyber threats.</p>
<h2 id="critical-recommendations">Critical Recommendations</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Address RDP Exposure Immediately:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Fix:</strong> Close port 3389 to external
internet access if RDP is not strictly required from outside the
internal network. Implement firewall rules to block inbound connections
to this port from untrusted sources.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Long-Term Solution:</strong> Implement a robust Virtual
Private Network (VPN) solution for all remote access. Ensure RDP is only
accessible via the VPN, effectively tunneling RDP traffic over an
encrypted and authenticated connection.</p></li>
<li><p>Enforce strong password policies for RDP accounts, implement
account lockout thresholds, and consider implementing Network Level
Authentication (NLA) if not already in place.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email
Access:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mandate and enforce MFA for all employee email accounts without
exception. This provides a critical second layer of authentication,
drastically reducing the risk of email account compromise from stolen
credentials.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide clear instructions and support to employees during the
MFA rollout.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="high-priority-recommendations">High Priority
Recommendations</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Establish a Comprehensive Annual Security Awareness
Training Program:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and implement a mandatory annual security awareness
training program for all employees, not just new hires. This training
should be interactive, up-to-date with current threat landscapes, and
tailored to the organization’s specific risks.</p></li>
<li><p>Topics should include, but not be limited to, phishing, social
engineering, malware recognition, secure data handling, password
hygiene, and incident reporting procedures.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct regular simulated phishing campaigns to test employee
vigilance and reinforce training concepts, providing immediate feedback
for continuous improvement.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>This assessment highlights critical areas requiring immediate
attention to bolster <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>’s
cybersecurity defenses. Prioritizing the implementation of Multi-Factor
Authentication for email, securing Remote Desktop Protocol access, and
establishing a robust, regular security awareness training program will
significantly reduce the organization’s attack surface and improve its
overall resilience against cyber threats. Continuous monitoring, regular
security assessments, and a commitment to ongoing security improvement
are essential in today’s dynamic threat landscape.</p>
