<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings from a recent cybersecurity posture
assessment conducted for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The
assessment involved analyzing network scan data, reviewing
organizational security controls via a questionnaire, and correlating
these with any pre-existing known risks.</p>
<p>Overall, the organization’s cybersecurity posture exhibits
significant areas for improvement. Critical gaps were identified in
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and the use of
outdated web server software, specifically Nginx 1.18.0, which is beyond
its end-of-life for security support. Additionally, the lack of regular,
annual security awareness training for all employees poses a
medium-level risk.</p>
<p>Addressing these findings, particularly the critical items related to
MFA and software patching, is paramount to enhancing the organization’s
resilience against common cyber threats. This report provides detailed
analysis, a summary of identified risks, and actionable recommendations
to mitigate these vulnerabilities.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-questionnaire-findings">Analysis
of Questionnaire Findings</h2>
<p>The questionnaire responses highlight two significant security
gaps:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Email Access:</strong> Not requiring MFA
for email access is a critical vulnerability. Email is a primary vector
for phishing, account takeover, and business email compromise (BEC)
attacks. Without MFA, compromised credentials can lead to unauthorized
access to sensitive communications and systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Insufficient Regular Security Awareness
Training:</strong> While new employees receive training, the absence of
annual training for all staff means that security knowledge may degrade
over time, and employees may not be updated on evolving threat
landscapes and organizational policies.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was conducted on <code>[Target IP]</code> to identify
open ports, services, and their versions.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="scan-metadata">Scan Metadata</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> 2025-11-22T10:00:00Z</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Scanner Used:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="open-ports-and-services">Open Ports and

<p>The following open port and service was identified during the
scan:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port:</strong> 443/tcp</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>State:</strong> Open</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Service Name:</strong></p></li>

<li><p><strong>Version:</strong></p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of
Technical Findings</h2>
<p>The primary technical finding is the presence of an outdated Nginx
web server. Nginx version 1.18.0 was released in April 2020 and reached
its End-of-Life (EOL) for security support in May 2021. Running an EOL
web server means it no longer receives security updates for newly
discovered vulnerabilities. This significantly increases the risk of
exploitation by attackers who could leverage known flaws to gain
unauthorized access, execute malicious code, or disrupt services.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the security questionnaire and technical
scan results, the following risks have been identified. No pre-existing
vulnerabilities were provided in the input data.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following recommendations are provided to mitigate the identified
risks and enhance the overall cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. Recommendations are prioritized
based on their severity and potential impact.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email
Access (High Priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mandate MFA for all user accounts accessing organizational
email.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider phishing-resistant MFA methods (e.g., FIDO2 security
keys) where feasible.</p></li>
<li><p>Educate users on the importance and process of MFA.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Update Nginx Web Server Software (High
Priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Immediately plan and execute an upgrade of Nginx from version
1.18.0 to the latest stable and supported version (e.g., Nginx
1.26.x).</p></li>
<li><p>Prior to upgrade, thoroughly test applications running on Nginx
in a staging environment to ensure compatibility.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement a regular patching schedule for all web servers and
critical infrastructure components.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Annual Security Awareness Training for All
Employees (Medium Priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Establish a mandatory annual security awareness training program
for all employees, not just new hires.</p></li>
<li><p>Training should cover current threat landscapes, phishing
recognition, password hygiene, data handling, and organizational
security policies.</p></li>
<li><p>Include regular simulated phishing exercises to test employee
awareness and response.</p></li>
