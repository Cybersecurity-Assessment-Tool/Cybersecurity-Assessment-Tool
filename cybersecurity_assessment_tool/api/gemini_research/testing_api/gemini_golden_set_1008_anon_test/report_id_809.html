<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong> based on a review of organizational
data, existing risk assessments, and a targeted network scan. While the
organization demonstrates good foundational security practices, such as
requiring Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for critical systems and
having an acceptable use policy, a significant critical vulnerability
related to Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) exposure has been identified
and confirmed. Furthermore, a crucial gap in security awareness training
for all employees at least once per year poses a high organizational
risk, potentially undermining other security controls. Immediate action
is recommended to mitigate the RDP exposure and establish a
comprehensive, ongoing security awareness program.</p>

Review (Questionnaire Analysis)</h1>
<p>A review of key security controls based on questionnaire responses
indicates a generally positive stance on foundational practices,
particularly regarding Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and policy
enforcement. However, one critical gap was identified concerning ongoing
security awareness training.</p>

</div>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-findings">Analysis of
Findings:</h2>
<p>The organization has implemented strong controls for MFA across
email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, which significantly
reduces the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials.
The presence of an employee acceptable use policy and initial security
awareness training for new employees are also positive steps.</p>
<p>However, the lack of annual security awareness training for all
employees is a significant gap. Regular training is crucial for keeping
employees informed about evolving threats (e.g., phishing, social
engineering) and reinforcing secure practices. Without it, the
effectiveness of technical controls can be compromised by human error,
making the organization more vulnerable to various attack vectors.</p>

<p>The scan identified Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) service running on
port 3389 as open. RDP, especially when exposed directly to the
internet, is a frequent target for attackers attempting brute-force
attacks, credential stuffing, and exploiting known vulnerabilities. Its
presence represents a significant attack surface that can lead to
unauthorized access to internal systems.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="risk-correlation-and-impact">Risk Correlation
and Impact:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>RDP Exposure:</strong> The technical scan confirmed an
open RDP port (3389), directly correlating with the pre-existing risk
"RDP Exposure" with a CVSS score of 9.0 (Critical). This indicates an
active and known vulnerability that allows external parties to
potentially interact with RDP services, greatly increasing the risk of
unauthorized network access, data breaches, and ransomware
attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Annual Security Awareness Training:</strong> This
organizational gap significantly amplifies the overall risk profile.
Even with strong technical controls, an untrained workforce can become
the weakest link, falling victim to phishing or social engineering,
which can then bypass MFA, install malware, or provide initial access to
internal systems. This is particularly concerning given the critical RDP
exposure, as strong user education can reduce the likelihood of
credential compromise that attackers might use to access RDP.</p></li>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following recommendations are provided to address the identified
risks and enhance the overall cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="recommendations-for-rdp-exposure">Recommendations for RDP
Exposure</h2>
<p>The exposure of RDP is a critical vulnerability that requires
immediate attention.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Fix: Block External RDP Access:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Configure perimeter firewalls to block all external inbound
connections to port 3389 (RDP). This is the most critical and urgent
step.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Long-Term Fix: Implement Secure Access
Methods:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>For legitimate RDP access, require users to connect via a Virtual
Private Network (VPN) or a secure Remote Desktop Gateway (RD Gateway)
that enforces Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).</p></li>
<li><p>If VPN/RD Gateway is not immediately feasible, consider using a
Jump Box or Bastion Host for all administrative access, ensuring it is
highly secured and monitored.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Strengthen RDP Security (if internal access is
required):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ensure Network Level Authentication (NLA) is enabled for all RDP
connections.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement strong, complex passwords for all accounts that can
access RDP.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider implementing account lockout policies to deter
brute-force attempts.</p></li>
<li><p>Regularly patch and update operating systems and RDP
clients/servers to protect against known vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p>Enable logging for RDP access and review logs regularly for
suspicious activity.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2
id="recommendations-for-lack-of-annual-security-awareness-training">Recommendations
for Lack of Annual Security Awareness Training</h2>
<p>Addressing the gap in recurring security awareness training is
crucial for building a resilient human firewall.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement Mandatory Annual Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and implement a mandatory annual security awareness
training program for all employees, covering topics such as phishing,
social engineering, password hygiene, data handling, and incident
reporting procedures.</p></li>
<li><p>Utilize engaging and interactive training modules to improve
retention.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Phishing Simulations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Conduct periodic phishing simulation exercises to test employee
awareness and resilience to real-world attack scenarios. Provide
immediate feedback and additional training to individuals who fall for
simulations.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Ongoing Communication:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Establish channels for ongoing security communication, such as
internal newsletters, email alerts for new threats, or dedicated
security portals, to keep security top-of-mind.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Promote a Culture of Security:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Foster an environment where employees feel comfortable reporting
suspicious activities without fear of reprimand.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The assessment highlights that while <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong> has a solid foundation in some key security areas like
MFA and initial employee training, the critical RDP exposure and the
absence of annual security awareness training present significant and
interconnected risks. Prioritizing the mitigation of RDP exposure and
establishing a robust, ongoing security awareness program will
substantially enhance the organization’s overall cybersecurity posture
and reduce its susceptibility to common and advanced threats.</p>
