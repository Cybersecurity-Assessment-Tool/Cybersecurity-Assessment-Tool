<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report presents a cybersecurity posture assessment based on
available data, aiming to identify vulnerabilities, assess risks, and
provide actionable recommendations. It is important to note that the
provided technical network scan data (Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON) and
pre-existing vulnerability data (Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON) were either
incomplete or malformed, preventing their full analysis and integration
into this assessment. Therefore, the findings are primarily driven by
the self-reported security control questionnaire
(Input_2_Org_Data_JSON).</p>
<p>The assessment revealed several critical gaps in foundational
security controls, particularly concerning Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) implementation across key systems and the establishment of robust
security awareness training programs. These gaps represent significant
risks that warrant immediate attention to improve the overall security
posture of the organization.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-security-control-gaps">Analysis
of Security Control Gaps</h2>
<p>Based on the questionnaire, several critical security control gaps
were identified:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins:</strong> The absence of
Multi-Factor Authentication for computer logins significantly increases
the risk of unauthorized access to endpoints and internal networks if
credentials are stolen or guessed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> Critical
data systems are vulnerable to credential compromise without MFA,
potentially leading to data breaches, compliance violations, and severe
business disruption.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Missing Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong>
Without a clear AUP, employees may not understand their responsibilities
regarding company IT resources, leading to potential misuse, data
leakage, and compliance issues.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong> New employees, without proper security awareness
training, are more susceptible to social engineering attacks (e.g.,
phishing), ransomware, and other common cybersecurity threats from day
one.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<h2 id="network-scan-findings">Network Scan Findings</h2>
<p>The provided network scan data (Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON) was
incomplete or malformed, preventing a detailed analysis of open ports,

identified or assessed from this input.</p>

Vulnerabilities</h2>
<p>Due to the lack of valid scan data, no services or specific technical

discovered services.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<h2 id="summary-of-identified-risks">Summary of Identified Risks</h2>
<p>The primary risks identified in this assessment stem from critical
security control gaps revealed in the organizational questionnaire, as
technical scan data and pre-existing vulnerability data were
unavailable.</p>

<h2 id="pre-existing-vulnerabilities">Pre-existing Vulnerabilities</h2>
<p>The input data for pre-existing vulnerabilities
(Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON) was incomplete or malformed, preventing an
assessment of any known or previously documented risks within the
organization.</p>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To enhance the overall cybersecurity posture, the following
recommendations are provided, primarily addressing the identified
control gaps from the organizational questionnaire:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong>
Urgently implement MFA for all access points, including computer logins
and sensitive data systems identified as lacking MFA. This is a critical
control to prevent unauthorized access even if passwords are
compromised.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Distribute an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a comprehensive AUP outlining employee
responsibilities, acceptable use of company IT assets, and consequences
of non-compliance. Ensure all employees acknowledge and understand this
policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Robust Security Awareness Training
Program:</strong> Implement mandatory security awareness training for
all new employees during onboarding. This training should cover
phishing, social engineering, password best practices, and incident
reporting procedures to address identified gaps.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally, once valid technical scan data and pre-existing
vulnerability information become available, a more comprehensive set of
technical recommendations can be developed.</p>
