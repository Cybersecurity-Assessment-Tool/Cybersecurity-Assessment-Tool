<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong> as of
<code>2025-11-22T10:00:00Z</code>. The assessment, derived from a
network scan, organizational security questionnaire, and existing risk
data, reveals several critical vulnerabilities and significant gaps in
foundational security controls. Key findings include the use of outdated
web server software, a lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA) for
computer logins, and an absence of comprehensive security awareness
training programs. These issues collectively elevate the organization’s
risk profile, making it susceptible to various cyber threats, including
unauthorized access, data breaches, and social engineering attacks.
Immediate action is recommended to implement robust security measures,
including software updates, mandatory MFA, and comprehensive security
awareness training programs.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>This report pertains to <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, an
entity with services potentially exposed via <code>[Client IP]</code>

assessment aims to provide an objective review of its current
cybersecurity standing.</p>
<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A review of the organization’s self-reported security controls

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was conducted on <code>2025-11-22T10:00:00Z</code>
targeting . The scan identified the following open ports and
services:</p>
<h2 id="open-port-details">Open Port Details</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 443 (TCP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>State:</strong> Open</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Service:</strong> HTTPS</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Product:</strong> Nginx</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.18.0</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of Technical
Findings</h2>
<p>The presence of Nginx version 1.18.0 is a significant concern. Nginx
1.18.0 was released in April 2020 and is now considered outdated. The
current stable branch is significantly newer (e.g., 1.26.x or later).
Running an outdated web server exposes the organization to known
vulnerabilities that have been patched in newer versions. Attackers
frequently target such systems due to the availability of exploits for
older software versions.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the questionnaire, technical scan, and
existing risk data, the following vulnerabilities and risks have been
identified. The organization currently has no pre-existing
vulnerabilities recorded in the provided data.</p>

1.18.0)</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Nginx 1.18.0, released in 2020, is
significantly outdated and likely contains known vulnerabilities that
could be exploited by attackers. Running unsupported or out-of-date
software increases the attack surface and risk of compromise.</td>

<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of MFA for Computer Login</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The organization does not require
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This
significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to internal
systems should employee credentials be compromised through phishing,
malware, or other means.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">No Security Awareness Training for New
Hires</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">New employees are not provided with
security awareness training. This leaves them vulnerable to social
engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) and unaware of
organizational security policies and best practices from the start of
their employment.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Medium</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">No Annual Security Awareness Training</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The organization does not conduct annual
security awareness training for all employees. This lack of ongoing
education means employees may forget critical security best practices,
leading to a degradation of the human firewall over time and increasing
susceptibility to threats.</td>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following recommendations are provided to mitigate the identified
risks and improve the overall cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Software Patching and Updates:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Immediately update Nginx 1.18.0 to the latest stable version
(e.g., 1.26.x or newer mainline). This addresses known vulnerabilities
and improves security.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement a robust patch management program to ensure all
operating systems, applications, and network devices are kept up-to-date
with the latest security patches.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mandate MFA for all computer logins across the organization. This
should be a top priority to significantly reduce the risk of
unauthorized access due to compromised credentials.</p></li>
<li><p>Review and extend MFA requirements to all critical systems and
applications where sensitive data is accessed or administrative
privileges are granted.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Comprehensive Security Awareness Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and implement a mandatory security awareness training
program for all new employees as part of their onboarding process. This
training should cover phishing, social engineering, password hygiene,
and acceptable use policies.</p></li>
<li><p>Establish an annual, mandatory security awareness training
program for all existing employees. This recurring training should
reinforce best practices, update employees on new threats, and cover
incident reporting procedures.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct periodic simulated phishing campaigns to test employee
vigilance and provide additional targeted training.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Security Reviews:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Conduct regular vulnerability scans and penetration tests to
proactively identify and address security weaknesses.</p></li>
<li><p>Periodically review and update security policies and procedures
(e.g., acceptable use policy) to reflect the evolving threat landscape
and organizational changes.</p></li>
