<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity assessment
conducted for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The assessment
involved a review of organizational security controls through a
questionnaire, a technical network scan of <code>[Target IP]</code>, and
an analysis of pre-existing risk data.</p>
<p>The overall security posture of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>
is assessed as <strong>Weak</strong>, primarily due to the presence of
severely outdated and misconfigured services, significant gaps in
employee security awareness training, and known use of unsupported
operating systems. Critical findings include an anonymous-accessible FTP
server running a highly vulnerable version of <code>vsftpd 2.3.4</code>,
which is known to have a backdoor. This, combined with a complete lack
of formal security awareness training for employees, exposes the
organization to severe risks including data breaches, system compromise,
and various forms of social engineering. Immediate and comprehensive
action is required to mitigate these critical vulnerabilities.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-security-control-gaps">Analysis
of Security Control Gaps</h2>
<p>The questionnaire results indicate a strong stance on Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) and the presence of an Acceptable Use Policy, which
are positive. However, the complete absence of security awareness
training for both new and existing employees is a <strong>critical
vulnerability</strong>. Without proper training, employees are
significantly more susceptible to phishing, social engineering attacks,
and can inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities through poor security
practices, negating the effectiveness of other technical controls.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was conducted on the target system

<li><p><strong>Analysis:</strong> This is a <strong>critical
finding</strong>. <code>vsftpd 2.3.4</code> is an extremely outdated
version released in 2011 and is known to contain a malicious backdoor
(CVE-2011-2523), allowing remote code execution. Furthermore, the FTP
server allows anonymous login, which means anyone can connect to the
server without credentials, potentially viewing, uploading, or
downloading files, exacerbating the risk of the outdated software. This
poses an immediate and severe risk of system compromise and data
breach.</p></li>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following recommendations are provided to address the identified
risks and enhance the overall cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. These are prioritized by
severity.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Mitigation of FTP Vulnerability
(Critical)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediately take the FTP server offline.
If FTP functionality is absolutely required, migrate to a secure
alternative (e.g., SFTP, FTPS) with a current, patched version of the
software.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Disable anonymous FTP access entirely.
Implement strong authentication mechanisms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Patch or upgrade <code>vsftpd</code> to
the latest stable version if FTP is still deemed necessary, ensuring all
known vulnerabilities are addressed. Consider moving FTP to a
demilitarized zone (DMZ) with strict firewall rules.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Eliminates the most critical and easily
exploitable remote code execution and data access
vulnerability.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Comprehensive Security Awareness Training
(High)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop and implement a mandatory
security awareness training program for all new employees upon
onboarding.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Establish a recurring annual security
awareness training program for all employees, covering topics such as
phishing, social engineering, password hygiene, data handling, and
incident reporting.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Significantly reduces human-factor
risks, improves organizational resilience against common attack
vectors.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade Outdated Operating Systems (High)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop and execute a plan to upgrade
all Windows 7 workstations to a currently supported operating system
(e.g., Windows 10 or 11).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Ensure all operating systems and
applications are kept up-to-date with the latest security
patches.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Closes known vulnerability gaps, ensures
systems receive critical security updates, and improves overall system
stability.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Vulnerability Scanning and Penetration
Testing</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Implement a schedule for regular
internal and external vulnerability scanning to continuously identify
new exposures.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Consider engaging third-party
penetration testers annually to simulate real-world attacks and identify
complex vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Provides ongoing visibility into the
security posture and proactively identifies weaknesses.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The assessment reveals several critical weaknesses that demand
immediate attention, particularly the highly vulnerable FTP service and
the absence of foundational security awareness training. Addressing
these findings through the recommended actions will significantly
enhance <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>’s defense against cyber
threats and improve its overall security posture.</p>
