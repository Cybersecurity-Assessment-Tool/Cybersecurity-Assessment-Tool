<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">1. Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong> based on a recent network scan, a
security questionnaire, and a review of existing organizational risks.
The organization demonstrates positive security practices in some areas,
such as conducting annual security awareness training for all employees
and requiring Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins.
However, significant vulnerabilities have been identified concerning the
lack of MFA for email and sensitive data systems, as well as the absence
of a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy. A recent network scan of the
target <code>[Target IP]</code> reported no open ports, with Port 80
specifically noted as closed. This finding contradicts a previously
identified risk of an "Unencrypted Web Server" on Port 80, suggesting
either remediation has occurred or further investigation into the
discrepancy is required. The overall security posture is assessed as
requiring immediate attention to address the identified gaps and
strengthen core security controls.</p>

Key Gaps Identified from Questionnaire</h2>
<p>Based on the responses, the following critical gaps have been
identified:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Email Access:</strong> Email remains a
primary vector for phishing and account compromise. The absence of MFA
significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to employee
inboxes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong>
Protecting access to systems containing sensitive organizational or
client data with MFA is crucial for maintaining data confidentiality,
integrity, and availability.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong>
An AUP provides clear guidelines for employees on appropriate use of
company assets and systems, reducing insider threat risks and ensuring
legal and regulatory compliance.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">4. Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>An Nmap scan was conducted on the designated target to identify open
ports and services.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="network-scan-findings">4.1. Network Scan
Findings</h2>
<p>The network scan of <code>[Target IP]</code> reported the host as
‘up‘. However, the scan did not detect any open ports. Specifically,
port 80 was explicitly identified as ‘closed‘. No services, products, or
versions could be enumerated due to the absence of open ports.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">6. Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the comprehensive analysis, the following actionable
recommendations are provided to enhance the cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>:</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="immediate-actions-high-priority">6.1.
Immediate Actions (High Priority)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Access:</strong> Mandate
Multi-Factor Authentication for all email accounts across the
organization without delay. This is a critical control to protect
against a majority of common credential-based attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong>
Identify all systems that process, store, or transmit sensitive
organizational or client data and enforce MFA for access to these
systems. Prioritize implementation based on data classification and
system criticality.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a comprehensive AUP that clearly outlines
acceptable use of company IT resources, data handling procedures, and
expected employee conduct. Ensure all employees are trained on,
acknowledge, and adhere to this policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Investigate "Unencrypted Web Server"
Discrepancy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Verify Remediation:</strong> Confirm if the "Unencrypted
Web Server" risk associated with Port 80 being open has been formally
remediated. If so, update the risk register to "Remediated" with
supporting evidence.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Clarify Scope:</strong> If the current scan target
(<code>[Target IP]</code>) differs from the asset where the unencrypted
web server was previously identified, clarify the scope of both the past
risk and the current scan.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Secure Web Services:</strong> If any web server is
intended to be available, ensure it operates exclusively over HTTPS
(Port 443) with valid SSL/TLS certificates. Port 80 should only be used
for redirection to HTTPS, if necessary, and not for serving content
directly.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="continuous-improvement">6.2. Continuous
Improvement</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Regular Network Scans:</strong> Implement a schedule for
regular, automated network scans to proactively identify any new open
ports, services, or misconfigurations that may arise from system changes
or new deployments.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Security Awareness Training Refinement:</strong> While
security awareness training is in place, periodically review and refine
its content to address emerging threats, specific organizational risks
(e.g., MFA bypass tactics), and reinforce policy adherence (e.g.,
AUP).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Policy Review and Updates:</strong> Establish a routine
for reviewing and updating all security policies, including the newly
created AUP, to ensure they remain relevant, effective, and align with
evolving threat landscapes, technologies, and regulatory
requirements.</p></li>
