<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the current cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on an analysis of provided
organizational data, network scan results, and existing risk registers.
The organization demonstrates strengths in implementing multi-factor
authentication for email and sensitive data systems, as well as
maintaining an acceptable use policy and initial security awareness
training for new employees. However, critical security gaps were
identified, notably the absence of multi-factor authentication for
computer logins and a lack of annual security awareness training for all
employees. Furthermore, a recent network scan indicates that no open
ports were identified on the scanned target, directly contradicting a
documented pre-existing risk regarding an unencrypted web server.
Recommendations are provided to address these findings, enhance the
overall security posture, and ensure an accurate risk register.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed to assess the external attack surface of
the designated target.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Target:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not specified (assumed recent at time
of report generation).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Used:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Target Status:</strong> The host was reported as ’up’ and
responsive.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports and Services:</strong> No open ports were
identified on the scanned target. Specifically, port 80, a common port
for unencrypted web traffic, was found to be
<code>closed</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note:</em> The absence of open ports on the scanned target is
generally a positive finding from an external perspective, as it
indicates a minimal external attack surface.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section integrates findings from the security control review,
technical scan results, and pre-existing risk documentation to provide a
comprehensive view of the organization’s risk landscape.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="identified-security-gaps-from-questionnaire">Identified Security
Gaps (from Questionnaire)</h2>
<p>Based on the security control review, the following critical gaps
have been identified, posing significant risks to the organization:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins:</strong> The absence of
multi-factor authentication for computer logins is a critical
vulnerability. It dramatically increases the risk of unauthorized access
to internal systems and data in the event of compromised employee
credentials. This represents a <strong>High Severity</strong>
risk.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Annual Security Awareness Training:</strong>
While new employees receive training, the failure to provide annual
security awareness training to all employees leads to knowledge decay
and leaves the workforce susceptible to evolving cyber threats, such as
sophisticated phishing campaigns and social engineering attacks. This
constitutes a <strong>Medium-High Severity</strong> risk.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="pre-existing-vulnerabilities-and-scan-correlation">Pre-existing
Vulnerabilities and Scan Correlation</h2>
<p>The organization’s existing risk register documented the following
vulnerability:</p>
<div class="center">
<table>
<thead>

<th style="text-align: left;"><strong>Risk Name</strong></th>
<th style="text-align: left;"><strong>Overview</strong></th>
<th style="text-align: left;"><strong>Severity</strong></th>

<td style="text-align: left;">Medium (CVSS 5.0)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p><strong>Correlation with Technical Scan:</strong> The network scan
performed on explicitly found port 80 to be <code>closed</code>. This
finding directly contradicts the overview provided in the "Unencrypted
Web Server" risk, which states "Port 80 is open." This discrepancy
suggests one of the following scenarios:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The risk has been successfully mitigated on the scanned target,
and the risk register entry is outdated.</p></li>
<li><p>The risk pertains to a different asset within the organization’s
infrastructure that was not covered by the current scan.</p></li>
<li><p>The overview description in the risk register is inaccurate or
has become inaccurate for the scanned asset.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Further investigation is required to reconcile this discrepancy and
ensure the accuracy of the risk register. For the scope of this report,
based on the provided scan data, this specific risk is considered
<strong>Potentially Mitigated</strong> on the scanned target, but its
broader applicability across the organization requires confirmation.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified security gaps, reconcile discrepancies, and
enhance the overall cybersecurity posture, the following actionable
recommendations are provided:</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="immediate-actions">Immediate Actions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Logins:</strong> Mandate and
implement multi-factor authentication for all computer logins across the
organization. This is a critical control that will significantly reduce
the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Annual Security Awareness Training
Program:</strong> Develop and implement a mandatory, comprehensive
annual security awareness training program for all employees. This
training should cover current threats (e.g., phishing, ransomware),
secure data handling, password hygiene, and organizational security
policies.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="risk-management-actions">Risk Management
Actions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Reconcile "Unencrypted Web Server" Risk Status:</strong>
Conduct an immediate investigation into the discrepancy between the
"Unencrypted Web Server" risk (indicating Port 80 open) and the network
scan results (Port 80 closed on ).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the risk has been mitigated for the scanned asset, formally
update its status in the risk register to "Mitigated" or
"Closed."</p></li>
<li><p>If the risk pertains to other assets not covered by this scan,
identify those assets and implement appropriate controls, such as
implementing SSL/TLS encryption, closing the port if not required, or
placing the service behind a protective firewall.</p></li>
<li><p>If the scan target itself was not representative of the original
risk, clarify the scope of the risk and conduct targeted scans on
relevant assets.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Regular Risk Register Reviews:</strong>
Establish a formal process for periodic (e.g., quarterly) review and
update of the organization’s risk register. This ensures accuracy,
reflects current technical realities, and helps prioritize risk
mitigation efforts.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="general-best-practices">General Best
Practices</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Regular Vulnerability Scanning and Penetration
Testing:</strong> Conduct regular internal and external vulnerability
scans, complemented by periodic penetration tests, to proactively
identify and address technical weaknesses across the entire IT
infrastructure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Policy Enforcement and Review:</strong> Regularly review
and update all security policies, including the acceptable use policy,
to ensure they remain relevant, are effectively communicated to
employees, and are consistently enforced.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p><strong>[Organization Name]</strong> has a foundational set of
security controls in place, demonstrating a commitment to certain
aspects of cybersecurity. However, the identified gaps in pervasive MFA
for computer logins and comprehensive annual security awareness
training, along with the need to actively reconcile existing risk
documentation with current technical findings, present clear and
actionable areas for immediate improvement. By diligently addressing
these recommendations, the organization can significantly strengthen its
defenses against prevalent cyber threats, enhance its overall
resilience, and foster a more mature security posture.</p>
