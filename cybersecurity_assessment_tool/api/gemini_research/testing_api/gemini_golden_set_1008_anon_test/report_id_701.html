<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This document presents a detailed analysis of the current
cybersecurity landscape for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The
assessment integrates findings from a targeted network scan, responses
to a vital security control questionnaire, and an inventory of known
risks. The objective is to provide a holistic view of the organization’s
security health, highlight critical areas for improvement, and offer
strategic recommendations to mitigate identified risks effectively.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-security-control-gaps">Analysis
of Security Control Gaps:</h2>
<p>The questionnaire reveals two significant gaps that pose a high risk
to the organization:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins:</strong> Not requiring
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins significantly
increases the risk of unauthorized access through compromised
credentials, potentially leading to widespread system
compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong> New employees are typically high-risk targets for
social engineering and phishing attacks. The lack of initial security
awareness training leaves them vulnerable and can introduce risks to the
organization from the outset of their employment.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed against the designated target. The scan
results provide insights into open ports and services, revealing
potential entry points for attackers.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="nmap-scan-findings">Nmap Scan Findings:</h2>
<p>The Nmap scan against <code>[Target IP]</code> identified the
following critical service:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 3389/tcp (Open):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Service:</strong> <code>ms-wbt-server</code> (Microsoft
Remote Desktop Protocol - RDP)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Description:</strong> RDP is a proprietary protocol
developed by Microsoft, which provides a user with a graphical interface
to connect to another computer over a network connection.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Significance:</strong> An open RDP port, especially when
exposed to the internet, is a frequent target for cyberattacks,
including brute-force attempts, credential stuffing, and exploitation of
known RDP vulnerabilities (e.g., BlueKeep). Successful exploitation can
grant an attacker full remote control over the target system.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The presence of an open RDP port on <code>[Target IP]</code> aligns
directly with the "RDP Exposure" risk documented in the organization’s
pre-existing risk register.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes the findings from the security control
review, technical scan, and pre-existing risks to provide a consolidated
view of the organization’s risk posture.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and strengthen the cybersecurity
posture of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, the following
actionable recommendations are provided:</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="recommendations-for-rdp-exposure-critical-risk">Recommendations for
RDP Exposure (<span style="color: critical">Critical</span> Risk):</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Access Restriction:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Immediately restrict external access to RDP (port 3389) on
<code>[Target IP]</code> and all other internet-facing systems. This can
be achieved by configuring firewall rules to only permit RDP connections
from trusted internal networks or specific, authorized jump
hosts.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Secure Remote Access Implementation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution as the primary
method for remote access to internal resources, including RDP services.
All remote connections should terminate on the VPN, which should then
allow access to internal systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Alternatively, consider a secure bastion host or a Remote Desktop
Gateway (RD Gateway) to serve as a single, hardened entry point for RDP
connections, requiring strong authentication and authorization.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>RDP Hardening:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ensure all RDP users have strong, unique passwords, and enforce
strict account lockout policies to thwart brute-force attacks.</p></li>
<li><p>Apply Network Level Authentication (NLA) for RDP connections,
which requires users to authenticate before a full RDP session is
established.</p></li>
<li><p>Regularly patch and update RDP servers to protect against known
vulnerabilities.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="recommendations-for-lack-of-mfa-for-computer-logins-high-risk">Recommendations
for Lack of MFA for Computer Logins (<span
style="color: high">High</span> Risk):</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for All Computer Logins:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Deploy and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all user
logins to organizational computers, including workstations and servers.
This should apply to both local and domain accounts where technically
feasible.</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluate MFA solutions compatible with the organization’s
existing identity providers (e.g., Active Directory, Azure AD).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Pilot Program and Rollout:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start with a pilot program for a small group of users to iron out
any technical or user experience issues.</p></li>
<li><p>Develop a phased rollout plan with clear communication and
support for all employees.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="recommendations-for-absence-of-security-awareness-training-for-new-employees-high-risk">Recommendations
for Absence of Security Awareness Training for New Employees (<span
style="color: high">High</span> Risk):</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Develop Mandatory Onboarding Security
Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create and implement a mandatory cybersecurity awareness training
program specifically for all new employees during their onboarding
process.</p></li>
<li><p>The training should cover essential topics such as phishing
identification, malware prevention, password hygiene, social engineering
tactics, data handling policies, and incident reporting
procedures.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Refresher Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>While annual training is conducted, ensure that the content is
current and addresses emerging threats. Integrate lessons learned from
recent incidents if applicable.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>This assessment highlights critical areas where <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong> can significantly improve its cybersecurity posture. By
immediately addressing the exposed RDP service, implementing MFA for
computer logins, and establishing robust security awareness training for
new employees, the organization can substantially reduce its attack
surface and strengthen its defenses against common cyber threats.
Ongoing vigilance, regular security reviews, and continuous improvement
are essential for maintaining a strong and resilient security posture in
the evolving threat landscape.</p>
