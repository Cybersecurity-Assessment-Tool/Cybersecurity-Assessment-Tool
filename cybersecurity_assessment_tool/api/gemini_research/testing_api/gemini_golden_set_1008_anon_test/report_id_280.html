<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment conducted for . The assessment encompassed a review of
organizational security controls via a questionnaire, an analysis of
network scan data, and an examination of reported pre-existing
risks.</p>
<p>Key findings indicate critical gaps in multi-factor authentication
(MFA) for email access and the absence of security awareness training
for new employees. These deficiencies present significant risks related
to account compromise and social engineering. Conversely, the external
network scan for the specified target revealed no open ports, suggesting
a potentially robust perimeter defense for the scanned scope. No
pre-existing vulnerabilities were provided in the input data.</p>
<p>Overall, the organization faces moderate to high risk due to
identified control deficiencies that could be exploited through common
attack vectors like phishing. Immediate attention to the recommendations
outlined in this report is advised to enhance the overall security
posture.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An Nmap-based network scan was conducted against the provided target
IP address to assess its external network posture. This scan provides a
snapshot of publicly accessible services.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target Assessed:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not available in provided
data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Used:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="findings">Findings:</h2>
<p>The network scan indicated that no open ports were identified for the
specified target IP address. All extra ports were reported as
<code>closed</code>. This suggests that the target either has a
well-configured external firewall effectively blocking inbound
connections, or the scope of the scan was limited such that no
accessible services were identified on commonly scanned ports. While
this finding is positive for external perimeter defense, it is important
to note that this limited scan does not guarantee the absence of all
vulnerabilities, particularly those residing within internal networks,
on non-standard ports, or specific application-layer weaknesses.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the questionnaire responses and technical
scans, the following risks have been identified. No pre-existing
vulnerabilities were provided in the input data.</p>

<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">No MFA for Email Access</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">High</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Without multi-factor authentication, email
accounts are highly susceptible to compromise via phishing, credential
stuffing, or brute-force attacks. This can lead to business email
compromise, data exfiltration, and serve as a foothold for further
internal network access.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;">No Security Awareness Training for New
Employees</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">High</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">New employees, lacking immediate security
awareness training during onboarding, are more likely to fall victim to
social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) as they may not
be familiar with organizational policies, common threat indicators, or
reporting procedures.</td>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actionable recommendations are provided to address the
identified risks and improve the overall cybersecurity posture of .</p>
<h2 id="identity-and-access-management">Identity and Access
Management</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Access:</strong> Mandate
multi-factor authentication for all email accounts across the
organization. Prioritize implementation for executive, administrative,
and privileged accounts. This is a critical control to prevent account
takeover.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="security-awareness-training">Security Awareness Training</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Mandatory Onboarding Security Training:</strong>
Establish a mandatory and comprehensive security awareness training
program for all new employees as an integral part of their onboarding
process. This training should cover phishing, social engineering,
password hygiene, data handling best practices, and the procedure for
reporting suspicious activities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Training Review and Updates:</strong> While
annual training is in place, regularly review and update the content of
all security awareness training programs (for both new and existing
employees) to reflect current threat landscapes, evolving attack
techniques, and organizational policy changes.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="proactive-security-measures">Proactive Security Measures</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Comprehensive Vulnerability Assessments:</strong> Conduct
regular, comprehensive internal and external vulnerability assessments
and penetration tests. This extends beyond basic port scanning to
identify deeper technical weaknesses in systems, applications, and
configurations that could be exploited.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Incident Response Plan Review and Testing:</strong>
Ensure an up-to-date and well-rehearsed incident response plan is in
place. Regular tabletop exercises or simulations should be conducted to
test the plan’s effectiveness in handling various security incidents,
particularly those arising from account compromises or social
engineering attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Security Policy Enforcement Review:</strong> Periodically
review the enforcement mechanisms for all security policies, including
the acceptable use policy, to ensure they are effectively mitigating
risks.</p></li>
