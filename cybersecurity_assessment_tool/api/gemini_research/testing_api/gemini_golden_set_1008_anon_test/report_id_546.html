<h2 id="analysis-of-questionnaire-findings">Analysis of Questionnaire
Findings</h2>
<p>The organization demonstrates strong adherence to best practices
concerning Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across critical access
points and has an established Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). These are
foundational security measures that significantly reduce the risk of
unauthorized access and misuse.</p>
<p>However, two critical gaps were identified related to security
awareness training:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of New Employee Training:</strong> There is no
formal security awareness training for new employees. This poses a
significant risk as new hires may be unfamiliar with organizational
security policies, common threat vectors (e.g., phishing), and best
practices, making them vulnerable targets.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Annual Employee Training:</strong> The
organization does not conduct security awareness training for all
employees at least once per year. Regular training is crucial to
reinforce security concepts, update employees on new threats, and
maintain a strong security culture. Without it, employees’ security
knowledge can degrade over time, increasing the human factor
risk.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on <code>[Target IP]</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not provided in input data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Target:</strong> <code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Summary:</strong> The scan reported that the target
host was up, but no open ports were identified. Specifically, port 80
was found to be <strong>closed</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of Technical
Findings</h2>
<p>The absence of open ports on the scanned target is a positive
finding, indicating a minimal attack surface from external network
vectors for common services. This significantly reduces the risk of
exploitation of network-accessible services.</p>
<p>However, it’s important to note a discrepancy: a pre-existing risk
entry (discussed in Section <a href="#sec:risk_assessment"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:risk_assessment">5</a>)
identifies an "Unencrypted Web Server" on Port 80. The current scan data
indicates Port 80 is closed. This suggests either the risk has been
mitigated since its last assessment or the target of the pre-existing
risk was different. Further verification is required to reconcile this
difference. Based on the current scan, the "Unencrypted Web Server"
risk, as described, appears to be mitigated.</p>
<h1 id="sec:risk_assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes findings from the questionnaire and existing
risk data to present a comprehensive risk assessment.</p>
<h2 id="identified-risks-and-gaps">Identified Risks and Gaps</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>High Risk: Insufficient Security Awareness Training for
New Employees.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees are not receiving
security awareness training, leaving them susceptible to social
engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) and potentially leading
to inadvertent data breaches or malware infections.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High (Direct impact on human security
posture).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>High Risk: Insufficient Annual Security Awareness
Training for All Employees.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Overview:</strong> Existing employees do not receive
regular security awareness training, leading to a degradation of
security knowledge and an increased likelihood of falling victim to
evolving cyber threats.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High (Widespread impact on human
security posture).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Medium Risk: Potential Unencrypted Web Server (Status
Pending Verification).</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Overview:</strong> An existing risk register entry
indicates an "Unencrypted Web Server" on Port 80, posing a risk of data
interception for unencrypted traffic.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Severity (Original):</strong> Medium (CVSS 5.0).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Current Status based on Scan:</strong> The latest network
scan reports Port 80 as <strong>closed</strong>. If accurate, this risk
is currently mitigated. <em>Verification is strongly
recommended.</em></p></li>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To strengthen the cybersecurity posture of <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong>, the following recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Mandatory Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop and implement a mandatory
security awareness training program for all new hires during their
onboarding process. This should cover company security policies, common
cyber threats (e.g., phishing, malware), password best practices, and
incident reporting procedures.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> Critical</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Annual Security Awareness Training for All
Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Implement a recurring (at least annual)
security awareness training program for all employees. This training
should be engaging, cover current threat landscapes, and reinforce key
security principles.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> Critical</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Verify Status of Port 80 and Associated
Risk:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Confirm the current status of Port 80 on
the relevant server or system identified in the original risk. If it is
indeed closed, formally update the risk register to reflect that the
"Unencrypted Web Server" risk (CVSS 5.0) is mitigated. If it is found to
be open, immediate action should be taken to either close it or
implement HTTPS with valid SSL/TLS certificates.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> High</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p><strong>[Organization Name]</strong> demonstrates a solid foundation
in implementing Multi-Factor Authentication and maintaining an
Acceptable Use Policy. However, critical vulnerabilities exist in the
human element, primarily due to the lack of comprehensive and recurring
security awareness training. While the recent network scan indicates a
minimal external attack surface, the discrepancy regarding the
unencrypted web server on Port 80 necessitates immediate verification.
Addressing these identified gaps through the proposed recommendations
will significantly enhance the organization’s overall cybersecurity
resilience against both technical and human-centric threats.</p>
