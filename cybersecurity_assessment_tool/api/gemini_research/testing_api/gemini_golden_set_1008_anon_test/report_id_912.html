<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">1. Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings from an assessment of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>’s cybersecurity posture. Key
insights derived from the organizational security questionnaire
highlight critical deficiencies in email security and new employee
onboarding security practices. Specifically, the absence of MFA for
email access represents a severe risk, as email remains a primary vector
for cyberattacks. Furthermore, the lack of security awareness training
for new hires exposes the organization to increased social engineering
threats. While the organization demonstrates strengths in other areas,
such as MFA for computer logins and sensitive data, these critical gaps
demand immediate attention. Due to errors in the provided technical scan
data and existing risk register, a complete technical and holistic risk
assessment was not possible.</p>

id="key-findings-from-questionnaire-analysis">3.1. Key Findings from
Questionnaire Analysis</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Critical Gap: No MFA for Email.</strong> This is the most
severe vulnerability identified. Email accounts are frequent targets for
phishing, business email compromise (BEC), and account takeover attacks.
The absence of MFA significantly escalates the risk of successful
credential compromise, leading to potential data breaches, financial
fraud, and lateral movement within the network.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>High Risk: No Security Awareness Training for New
Employees.</strong> New hires are often the most vulnerable to social
engineering and targeted phishing campaigns due to their lack of
familiarity with organizational security policies, common threat
indicators, and reporting procedures. This gap creates an unnecessary
entry point for attackers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Positive Controls Identified:</strong> The organization
correctly implements MFA for logging into computers and accessing
sensitive data systems. The presence of an employee acceptable use
policy and annual security awareness training for all employees are also
positive indicators of foundational security efforts.</p></li>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">6. Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and significantly enhance
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>’s overall cybersecurity posture,
the following recommendations are strongly advised:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email
Access (Critical Priority).</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Enable and rigorously enforce MFA for <em>all</em> email accounts
across the organization immediately.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct an awareness campaign to educate users on the importance
of MFA and provide clear instructions for enrollment and usage.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider deploying phishing-resistant MFA methods (e.g., FIDO2
security keys) for highly privileged accounts.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Mandatory Security Awareness Training for New
Employees (High Priority).</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and implement a comprehensive security awareness program
that all new employees must complete as an integral part of their
onboarding process.</p></li>
<li><p>The training should cover essential topics such as identifying
phishing attempts, strong password practices, data handling protocols,
and the procedure for reporting suspicious activities.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct a Comprehensive Technical Vulnerability Scan and
Penetration Test.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Initiate regular, authenticated vulnerability scans and
external/internal penetration tests across all network assets (servers,
workstations, web applications) to identify and remediate technical
weaknesses.</p></li>
<li><p>Prioritize patching and configuration hardening based on
vulnerability severity, exploitability, and asset criticality.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Regularly Review and Update Security
Policies.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ensure that all cybersecurity policies, including the Acceptable
Use Policy, are reviewed and updated at least annually to align with
evolving threat landscapes, regulatory requirements, and best
practices.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Maintain and Enhance Annual Security Awareness
Training.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Continue the annual security awareness training for all
employees, ensuring the content is regularly updated to include the
latest threat intelligence, attack vectors, and organizational-specific
risks.</p></li>
</ul></li>

<p>This report is generated based on the specific data inputs provided.
The analysis scope was significantly limited by missing and malformed
input data, particularly regarding the technical network scan
(Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON) and pre-existing risk register
(Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON). As such, this assessment may not reflect
the full cybersecurity posture of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>,
and a complete evaluation would necessitate valid and comprehensive data
from all relevant sources.</p>
