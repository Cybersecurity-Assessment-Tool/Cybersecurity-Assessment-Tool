<td style="text-align: left;">No Security Awareness Training (New
Employees)</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">New employees, lacking initial security
awareness training, are more susceptible to social engineering attacks

due to unfamiliarity with organizational policies and cybersecurity best
practices.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;">Incomplete Technical Visibility</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The unavailability of network scan data

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">5. Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and improve the overall cybersecurity
posture, the following actionable recommendations are provided:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Access:</strong>
<strong>Immediate Priority.</strong> Deploy Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) for all organizational email accounts. This is a foundational
security control that dramatically reduces the risk of credential
compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Login:</strong> Extend MFA
requirements to all computer logins, especially for accounts with
privileged access or those accessing sensitive data. This provides a
crucial additional layer of security beyond single-factor
passwords.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Mandatory Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong> Develop and enforce a comprehensive security
awareness training program for all new hires as part of their
onboarding. This training should cover phishing, social engineering,
password hygiene, and internal reporting procedures.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Annual Security Awareness Training for All
Employees:</strong> Implement a continuous security education program,
ensuring all employees receive updated security awareness training at
least annually. Training should be engaging, relevant to current threat
landscapes, and regularly tested (e.g., through simulated phishing
campaigns).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Comprehensive Technical Vulnerability
Scans:</strong> Arrange for a complete and up-to-date network
vulnerability scan to identify open ports, service versions, potential
misconfigurations, and other technical weaknesses. Ensure scan results
are thoroughly analyzed and prioritized for remediation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement a Vulnerability Management Program:</strong>
Establish a robust vulnerability management process that includes
regular scanning, assessment, prioritization, and timely remediation of
identified security flaws across all IT assets.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ensure Complete Data Provision for Future
Assessments:</strong> For any future cybersecurity assessments, it is
critical to provide all requested data, including complete and valid
network scan results, details of existing vulnerabilities, and
comprehensive organizational information, to enable a thorough and
accurate evaluation.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">6. Conclusion</h1>
<p>The current cybersecurity posture for <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong>, as derived from the provided questionnaire responses,
indicates significant vulnerabilities, particularly in the deployment of
Multi-Factor Authentication and the implementation of Security Awareness
Training. While the presence of MFA for sensitive data systems and an
acceptable use policy are positive, the absence of these fundamental
controls in other critical areas creates a high risk of credential
compromise and successful social engineering attacks.</p>
<p>The inability to perform a technical analysis due to broken scan
data, coupled with the lack of information on existing vulnerabilities,
means that the organization’s full exposure to technical exploits and
known weaknesses remains largely unquantified. It is imperative that
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong> promptly addresses the identified
gaps and ensures complete data provision for any future security
assessments. Implementing the recommended actions will significantly
enhance the organization’s resilience against common cyber threats and
foster a stronger overall security posture.</p>
