<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">1. Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings from a cybersecurity posture
assessment conducted for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The
assessment combined a review of organizational security controls via a
questionnaire, an external network scan, and an analysis of existing
vulnerability data.</p>
<p>The organization demonstrates some foundational security measures,
such as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data
systems. However, several critical gaps were identified in its security
posture, primarily concerning MFA for computer logins, the absence of an
Employee Acceptable Use Policy, and a complete lack of security
awareness training programs for both new and existing employees.</p>
<p>From a technical perspective, the recent network scan of did not
identify any open ports, indicating a secure external perimeter for the
scanned target. This contradicts a previously documented risk of an
"Unencrypted Web Server" on Port 80, suggesting the need for
re-evaluation of stale risk entries.</p>
<p>Recommendations focus on addressing the identified organizational
control gaps and verifying the status of legacy technical risks to
improve the overall security posture.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment">5. Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section details the identified risks, categorized by their
source: organizational control gaps and technical findings.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="organizational-risks-from-security-control-review">5.1.
Organizational Risks (from Security Control Review)</h2>
<p>Based on the "No" responses in the security control questionnaire,
the following critical organizational risks and control gaps were
identified:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Risk 5.1.1: Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
Computer Logins</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Overview:</strong> The absence of MFA for computer logins
significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to internal
systems and data, even if user credentials are compromised.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Risk 5.1.2: Absence of an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Severity:</strong> Medium</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Overview:</strong> Without an AUP, employees may not be
aware of their responsibilities regarding the use of company assets and
data, leading to potential misuse, data breaches, or legal
liabilities.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Risk 5.1.3: Lack of Security Awareness Training for New
Employees</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees are particularly
vulnerable to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) and may
unknowingly introduce security risks if not properly educated on
organizational security policies and best practices from day
one.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Risk 5.1.4: Lack of Annual Security Awareness Training
for All Employees</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Overview:</strong> Without regular, annual security
awareness training, employees’ knowledge of evolving threats and
organizational policies can become outdated, diminishing their ability
to recognize and respond to cyber threats effectively.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="technical-risks-from-network-scan">5.2.
Technical Risks (from Network Scan)</h2>
<p>The network scan did not identify any active technical
vulnerabilities or open ports.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="pre-existing-risks-from-input-3-correlation">5.3. Pre-existing Risks
(from Input 3) &amp; Correlation</h2>
<p>The following risk was previously documented and provided for
review:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Risk 5.3.1: Unencrypted Web Server</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Severity:</strong> 5.0 (CVSS)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Overview:</strong> "Port 80 is open."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong> Port 80</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Correlation Note:</strong> The recent network scan
(Section 4) of explicitly found Port 80 to be <code>closed</code>. This
directly contradicts the overview provided for this pre-existing risk.
It is highly probable that this risk is either stale, refers to a
different system not included in the current scan, or has been
remediated.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">6. Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are provided to
enhance the cybersecurity posture of <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong>:</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="address-organizational-control-gaps">6.1.
Address Organizational Control Gaps</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Logins:</strong> Mandate and
enforce Multi-Factor Authentication for all computer login processes
across the organization to significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized
access due to compromised credentials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Employee Acceptable Use
Policy:</strong> Create a clear, comprehensive AUP that outlines
employees’ responsibilities and acceptable behaviors regarding the use
of company IT resources, data, and internet access. Ensure all employees
acknowledge and understand this policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong> Integrate mandatory security awareness training into
the onboarding process for all new hires. This training should cover
phishing, malware, password hygiene, data handling, and relevant company
policies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Annual Security Awareness Training for All
Employees:</strong> Conduct mandatory, regular (at least annual)
security awareness training for all existing employees. Training content
should be updated to reflect current threat landscapes and emerging best
practices.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="technical-risk-management">6.2. Technical
Risk Management</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Verify and Reconcile "Unencrypted Web Server"
Risk:</strong> Investigate the discrepancy between the pre-existing risk
documentation (Port 80 open) and the current scan results (Port 80
closed).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Determine if the risk refers to a different system or IP address
not covered by the current scan.</p></li>
<li><p>If the scanned target is indeed the system the risk refers to,
and Port 80 is confirmed closed, then the risk should be formally closed
and archived in the vulnerability management system.</p></li>
<li><p>If Port 80 is found to be open on a different system, ensure it
is properly secured with HTTPS/TLS encryption.</p></li>
</ul></li>
