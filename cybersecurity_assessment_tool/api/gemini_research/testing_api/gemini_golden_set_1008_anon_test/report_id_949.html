<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">1. Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report presents a comprehensive assessment of the cybersecurity
posture for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on an analysis
of network scan data, responses to an organizational security
questionnaire, and existing risk information. The assessment highlights
critical areas requiring immediate attention, including an outdated web
server (Nginx 1.18.0), a lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
sensitive data systems, and a deficiency in security awareness training
for new employees. While some foundational security controls are in
place, proactive measures are essential to mitigate identified
vulnerabilities and strengthen the overall security landscape.</p>

</div>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-questionnaire-gaps">Analysis of
Questionnaire Gaps:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> The
absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for systems handling
sensitive data significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access.
Should credentials for these systems be compromised, an attacker would
face no additional authentication barrier. This represents a critical
security vulnerability.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong> While annual security awareness training is provided
to all employees, the lack of dedicated initial training for new hires
is a notable gap. New employees may inadvertently introduce security
risks through phishing susceptibility, poor password hygiene, or
unawareness of organizational security policies from the outset of their
employment.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">4. Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on on <strong>22 November 2025</strong>.
The scan identified the following open port and associated services:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP/Hostname:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> 22 November 2025</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports Found:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 443 (HTTPS):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>State:</strong> Open</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Service:</strong> HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol
Secure)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Product:</strong> Nginx</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.18.0</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="technical-analysis">Technical Analysis:</h2>
<p>The most significant technical finding is the presence of Nginx
version 1.18.0 serving content on port 443. Nginx 1.18.0 is an
End-of-Life (EOL) version, with its stable release in 2020 and its
support cycle concluding long ago. Running EOL software inherently poses
a high security risk, as it no longer receives critical security patches
for newly discovered vulnerabilities. This leaves the web server, and
potentially the underlying systems and data, exposed to a wide array of
exploits, including but not limited to denial-of-service attacks,
information disclosure vulnerabilities, and remote code execution.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment">5. Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the combined analysis of the organizational questionnaire
and the technical scan results, the following risks have been
identified:</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">6. Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and enhance the overall cybersecurity
posture, the following actionable recommendations are provided:</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="technical-recommendations">6.1. Technical
Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade/Patch Web Server (Nginx):</strong> Immediately
upgrade Nginx to the latest stable and supported version (e.g., Nginx
1.24.x or a newer mainline/LTS release). Implement a robust patch
management process to ensure all web-facing software, operating systems,
and underlying libraries are kept up-to-date.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Vulnerability Management:</strong> Implement regular
vulnerability scanning and penetration testing on all public-facing
services and critical internal systems to identify and remediate
vulnerabilities proactively.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="policy-and-process-recommendations">6.2.
Policy and Process Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong>
Mandate and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all access to
systems handling sensitive organizational data. This should be a top
priority to protect against credential theft and unauthorized access.
Review and update access control policies to explicitly require MFA for
these systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enhance New Employee Onboarding Security
Training:</strong> Develop and implement a mandatory security awareness
training program specifically for all new employees, to be completed as
part of their initial onboarding process. This training should cover
essential security topics such as phishing identification, malware
prevention, password management, social engineering tactics, and
internal incident reporting procedures.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Review and Update Security Policies:</strong>
Periodically review and update all security policies, especially those
pertaining to access control, acceptable use, data protection, and
incident response, to ensure they align with current best practices and
adequately address identified gaps.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">7. Conclusion</h1>
<p>This assessment has identified several critical and high-priority
risks that, if unaddressed, could significantly compromise the security
of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. By promptly implementing the
recommended actions, particularly upgrading the outdated web server,
enforcing MFA for sensitive data, and enhancing security awareness
training for new employees, the organization can substantially reduce
its attack surface and improve its resilience against evolving cyber
threats. Continuous monitoring, regular security assessments, and
ongoing security awareness initiatives are vital for maintaining a
strong and adaptive security posture.</p>
