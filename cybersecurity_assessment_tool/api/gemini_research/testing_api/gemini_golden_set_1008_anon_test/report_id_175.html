<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture assessment for
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, conducted on 2026-01-26. The
assessment integrated data from a network scan, an organizational
security questionnaire, and a review of existing risks to identify
critical security gaps and potential vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Key findings indicate significant deficiencies in fundamental
security controls. Notably, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not
universally enforced, and there is an absence of a formal Employee
Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). Furthermore, new employees do not receive
dedicated security awareness training. The network scan identified an
open SSH port on the target system, which, if not properly secured,
presents a potential attack vector. These combined factors indicate a
heightened risk profile for the organization. Comprehensive and
actionable recommendations are provided to address these identified
risks and enhance the overall cybersecurity resilience.</p>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This document serves as a comprehensive report on the cybersecurity
posture of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The assessment was
performed by an expert cybersecurity analyst, synthesizing information
from three distinct data sources: a network scan (Input 1), responses to
an organizational security questionnaire (Input 2), and a review of
current known risks (Input 3). The primary objective is to pinpoint
vulnerabilities, evaluate associated risks, and formulate targeted
recommendations to bolster the organization’s security landscape against
evolving threats.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-questionnaire-findings">Analysis
of Questionnaire Findings</h2>
<p>The responses indicate a significant lack of critical, foundational
security practices:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Critical MFA Deficiency</strong>: Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) is not required for email access, computer logins,
or sensitive data systems. This represents a critical vulnerability, as
the compromise of a single credential (e.g., via phishing) could grant
unauthorized actors full access without an additional layer of
authentication.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)</strong>: The lack
of a formal AUP means employees may not have clear, documented
guidelines regarding the acceptable and prohibited use of organizational
IT resources. This increases the risks of employee misuse, inadvertent
data breaches, and potential non-compliance with legal or regulatory
requirements.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Insufficient New Employee Security Awareness
Training</strong>: While annual security awareness training is conducted
for all employees, the absence of dedicated training for new employees
means they may not be adequately equipped to identify and respond to
common security threats from their first day, posing an immediate risk
to the organization.</p></li>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of
Technical Findings</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Open Port 22 (SSH)</strong>: The scan identified an open
SSH (Secure Shell) port on the target system. While SSH is a legitimate
protocol used for secure remote access and data transfer, it is also a
frequent target for malicious actors, including brute-force attacks,
credential stuffing, and attempts to exploit known vulnerabilities.
Without specific version information, it is not possible to determine if
the SSH server is running outdated software with known CVEs. However,
any open SSH service, especially if exposed to the internet, should be
rigorously secured, hardened, and continuously monitored. Best practices
include disabling password authentication in favor of key-based
authentication, disallowing root login, implementing strict access
control lists (ACLs) to limit source IP addresses, and ensuring the SSH
server software is kept up-to-date.</p></li>

Review</h2>
<p>The input data for current risks indicated no pre-existing
vulnerabilities or risks (<code>"vulnerabilities": []</code>).
Therefore, this report focuses solely on the newly identified risks
derived from this assessment.</p>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the critical findings and identified risks, the following
actionable recommendations are provided to enhance the cybersecurity
posture of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Systematically</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Priority</strong>: Mandate MFA for all email
accounts, as email is a primary vector for credential theft and
phishing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>High Priority</strong>: Mandate MFA for all user and
administrative computer logins, especially for devices accessing
sensitive networks or data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>High Priority</strong>: Implement MFA for access to all
sensitive data systems, applications, and cloud services.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop, Implement, and Enforce an Employee Acceptable
Use Policy (AUP)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Priority</strong>: Draft a clear, comprehensive
AUP that outlines acceptable and unacceptable use of all company IT
resources, data, and communication systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>High Priority</strong>: Ensure all existing and new
employees formally read, understand, and acknowledge the AUP. Integrate
this into onboarding and annual compliance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ongoing</strong>: Regularly review and update the AUP to
reflect changes in technology, organizational policies, and the threat
landscape.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Mandatory Security Awareness Training for New
Employees</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Priority</strong>: Implement a mandatory,
foundational security awareness training program as a critical component
of the onboarding process for all new hires.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Content Focus</strong>: This training should cover
essential topics such as identifying phishing attempts, malware
recognition, strong password practices, secure data handling, and the
importance of adhering to the AUP.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Secure and Harden SSH Services</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Review Necessity</strong>: Assess whether SSH access is
strictly required to be open to the internet. If not, restrict access to
internal networks only or specific, trusted IP addresses using firewall
rules.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Authentication Strengthening</strong>: Disable
password-based authentication and enforce key-based authentication for
all SSH access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Privilege Management</strong>: Disable direct root login
via SSH. Instead, require users to log in with a non-root account and
use ‘sudo‘ for privileged operations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Software Updates</strong>: Ensure the SSH server is
running the latest stable version to mitigate known
vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Logging and Monitoring</strong>: Configure comprehensive
logging for all SSH connection attempts and successful logins. Integrate
these logs with a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
system for continuous monitoring and alert generation for suspicious
activities (e.g., repeated failed login attempts).</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The cybersecurity posture assessment for <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong> has revealed critical vulnerabilities, primarily stemming
from insufficient foundational security controls such as the lack of
universal Multi-Factor Authentication, an absent Acceptable Use Policy,
and inadequate initial security training for new employees.
