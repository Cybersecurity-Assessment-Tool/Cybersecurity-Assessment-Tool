<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">1. Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on an organizational
security questionnaire review and an external network scan. While the
organization demonstrates a strong stance on multi-factor authentication
(MFA) across critical access points, significant gaps exist in
foundational security policies and employee security awareness training.
The external network scan revealed no open ports on the target, which is
a positive indicator for the external perimeter; however, this scan was
limited in scope and does not reflect the internal security posture. Key
areas for improvement include developing an Acceptable Use Policy and
implementing regular, comprehensive security awareness training
programs.</p>

Analysis of Questionnaire Findings</h2>
<p>The organization has successfully implemented Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) across key access points (email, computer login,
sensitive data systems), which is a critical security control. However,
significant deficiencies were identified in the areas of security
policies and employee training:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> The absence
of an AUP means employees may not have clear guidelines on acceptable
technology use, increasing risks of misuse, data breaches, and
non-compliance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Security Awareness Training:</strong> The lack of both
new hire and annual security awareness training leaves employees
vulnerable to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting)
and unaware of common cybersecurity threats and best practices. This is
a critical gap, as employees are often considered the weakest link in
the security chain without proper training.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">4. Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed to identify publicly
accessible services and potential vulnerabilities.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> N/A (not provided in scan
data)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Target Host:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Used:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="scan-summary">4.1. Scan Summary</h2>
<p>The Nmap scan against the specified target did not identify any open
ports. All extra ports were reported as closed.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="detailed-findings">4.2. Detailed
Findings</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> The target host was reported as
"up".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports and Services:</strong> No open ports were
discovered. This indicates a strong external perimeter from a basic
port-scanning perspective, suggesting that no common services are
exposed directly to the internet on this target IP.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Vulnerable Services:</strong> As no services were found,
no vulnerabilities related to outdated software versions or
misconfigurations could be identified from this scan.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: This scan provides a limited view of the external attack
surface and does not assess internal network security, web application
security, or other potential vectors.</em></p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment">5. Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the combined analysis of the security questionnaire and the
technical scan, the following risks have been identified. No
pre-existing vulnerabilities were provided in the input data.</p>

activities that expose the organization to legal, reputational, and

use.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Absence of New Hire Security Training</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">New employees are a common target for
social engineering. Without initial training, they lack fundamental
security awareness, increasing the risk of phishing, malware infections,
and data breaches.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of Annual Security Awareness
Training</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Employees’ security knowledge can degrade
over time, and new threats emerge. The absence of recurrent training
leaves the entire workforce vulnerable to evolving cyber threats.</td>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">6. Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and enhance the overall cybersecurity
posture, the following recommendations are provided:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create a clear, concise AUP that outlines acceptable and
unacceptable use of company IT resources, data, and internet
access.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure the AUP is communicated to all employees, acknowledged,
and enforced consistently.</p></li>
<li><p>Integrate the AUP into new employee onboarding.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Mandatory Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop an onboarding security awareness program covering basic
cybersecurity principles, phishing recognition, password best practices,
and incident reporting procedures.</p></li>
<li><p>Make this training mandatory for all new hires before granting
full system access.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Annual Mandatory Security Awareness Training
for All Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Design and deliver an annual security awareness training program
for all employees.</p></li>
<li><p>The training should be engaging, up-to-date with current threats,
and include simulated phishing exercises to test and reinforce
learning.</p></li>
<li><p>Track completion rates and comprehension.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Expand Technical Security Assessments:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>While the external scan showed no open ports, consider deeper
external penetration testing, web application security testing, and
internal network vulnerability assessments to gain a more complete
picture of technical risks.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure future network scans include ‘scan_date‘ for proper
reporting and historical tracking.</p></li>
</ul></li>
