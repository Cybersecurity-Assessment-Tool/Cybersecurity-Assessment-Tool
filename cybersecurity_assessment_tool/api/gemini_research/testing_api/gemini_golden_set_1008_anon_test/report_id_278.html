<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive assessment of the current
cybersecurity posture of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on
an organizational security questionnaire review, technical network scan
results, and analysis of pre-existing risk data. The assessment
identifies several critical areas for improvement, primarily concerning
foundational security controls such as Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA), security awareness training, and the presence of severely
outdated and insecure services on internet-facing systems. Key findings
include the use of anonymous FTP and an outdated
<code>vsftpd 2.3.4</code> service, along with significant gaps in
organizational MFA adoption for critical services. Addressing these
findings is crucial for enhancing the organization’s defensive
capabilities against prevalent cyber threats and mitigating potential
exploitation.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was conducted on <code>[Target IP]</code> to identify
open ports and running services. The scan revealed the following
critical findings:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Target:</strong> <code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports and Services:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 21 (FTP):</strong></p>

<li><p><strong>Service Name:</strong> <code>ftp</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Product/Version:</strong>
<code>vsftpd 2.3.4</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Details:</strong> This version of <code>vsftpd</code> is
severely outdated and has known critical vulnerabilities, most notably a
backdoor vulnerability (CVE-2011-2523) affecting specific builds
released in 2011. Running this service publicly exposes the organization
to extreme risks of system compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Finding:</strong> The service allows anonymous FTP login.
This misconfiguration permits unauthorized users to access files on the
FTP server without providing any credentials, leading to potential data
exposure, unauthorized data upload, or serving as a staging point for
malicious activities.</p></li>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and improve the overall
cybersecurity posture, the following actionable recommendations are
provided. Prioritization is given to critical and high-severity
risks.</p>
<h2 id="immediate-actions-critical-high-risks">Immediate Actions
(Critical &amp; High Risks)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email:</strong> Immediately enable and
enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all organizational email
accounts. This significantly reduces the risk of email account
compromise, even if credentials are stolen.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Decommission or Secure FTP Service:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the FTP service is not critically required for business
operations, it should be immediately decommissioned and removed from
internet exposure.</p></li>
<li><p>If FTP functionality is necessary, the <code>vsftpd</code>
service <em>must</em> be upgraded to the latest stable and supported
version. Implement secure configurations, including disabling anonymous
access, enforcing strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., user accounts
with strong passwords), and restricting access to trusted IP ranges.
Consider migrating to SFTP or FTPS for encrypted data transfer.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Disable Anonymous FTP Access:</strong> As an interim
measure, if the FTP service cannot be immediately decommissioned or
upgraded, disable anonymous login access to prevent unauthorized access.
Ensure all necessary access requires authenticated user
accounts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade Windows Operating Systems:</strong> Prioritize
and execute a project to upgrade all workstations and servers running
Windows 7 to a currently supported operating system (e.g., Windows 10 or
11). Establish and enforce a robust patch management program for all
endpoints.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mid-term-actions-medium-risks">Mid-Term Actions (Medium
Risks)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Onboarding Security Awareness Training:</strong>
Implement mandatory cybersecurity awareness training for all new
employees as a critical component of their onboarding process. This
training should cover organizational security policies, common threat
vectors (e.g., phishing, malware), safe browsing habits, and incident
reporting procedures.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Annual Security Awareness Refresher:</strong> While
already conducted annually for all employees, continuously review and
update the content of this training to address emerging threats and
reinforce best practices.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="general-security-best-practices">General Security Best
Practices</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Conduct regular vulnerability scans and periodic penetration
tests to identify and address security weaknesses proactively.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement a robust patch management program for all systems,
applications, and network devices to ensure timely application of
security updates.</p></li>
<li><p>Regularly review and update cybersecurity policies, procedures,
and incident response plans to adapt to the evolving threat
landscape.</p></li>
<li><p>Deploy and configure Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
solutions on all workstations and servers.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all critical systems are comprehensively logged and
monitored for suspicious activity, with alerts configured for potential
security incidents.</p></li>
