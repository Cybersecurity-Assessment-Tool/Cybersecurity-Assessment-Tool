<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">1. Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on an analysis of network
scan data, organizational security policy questionnaire responses, and
pre-existing risk information.</p>
<p>The external network scan revealed no open ports for the target
<code>[Target IP]</code>, indicating a strong initial perimeter defense
against common external reconnaissance. However, the organization faces
significant internal and policy-based risks, particularly concerning
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) implementation, the absence of a
comprehensive Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), and deficiencies in regular
security awareness training. While a previously identified "Unencrypted
Web Server" risk exists in the organization’s records, the current
network scan shows that port 80 is closed, suggesting this specific
external exposure is currently mitigated. Addressing the identified
policy and MFA gaps is paramount to improving the overall security
posture and reducing the likelihood of successful social engineering or
internal compromise.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">6. Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the assessment, the following recommendations are provided
to enhance the organization’s cybersecurity posture:</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="high-priority-recommendations">6.1.
High-Priority Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Access:</strong> Immediately
deploy and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication for all email accounts.
This is a critical control against credential compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> Extend
MFA requirements to all systems storing or processing sensitive
organizational data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a clear AUP that outlines acceptable and
unacceptable use of organizational IT resources. Ensure all employees
read, understand, and acknowledge this policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Annual Security Awareness Training:</strong>
Establish a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all
employees, covering topics such as phishing, social engineering,
password hygiene, and data handling best practices.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="general-remediation-recommendations">6.2.
General / Remediation Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Verify Web Server Status (Unencrypted Web
Server):</strong> While the scan indicates port 80 is closed externally,
it is prudent to conduct an internal review to confirm the status of any
unencrypted web servers. If such a server exists internally, ensure it
is properly segmented and protected, and transition to HTTPS (port 443)
with valid SSL/TLS certificates for any publicly accessible web
services.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Network Scanning:</strong> Implement a schedule
for regular internal and external network vulnerability scans to
proactively identify and address potential exposures.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">7. Conclusion</h1>
<p><strong>[Organization Name]</strong> demonstrates a good external
network posture with no open ports detected on the scanned target.
However, there are significant foundational weaknesses in its security
policies and controls, particularly regarding Multi-Factor
Authentication adoption and employee security awareness. Addressing
these internal gaps through policy development, technical control
implementation, and continuous training will substantially reduce the
overall risk profile and build a more resilient cybersecurity
defense.</p>
