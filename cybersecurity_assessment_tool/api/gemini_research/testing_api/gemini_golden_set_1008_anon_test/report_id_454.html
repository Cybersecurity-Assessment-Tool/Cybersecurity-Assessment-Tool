<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture assessment for
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, conducted on 2026-01-26. The
assessment involved a review of the organization’s security controls via
a questionnaire, a targeted network scan, and an analysis of any
pre-existing known vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Key findings indicate significant gaps in foundational security
controls, particularly concerning Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
implementation for computer logins and sensitive data access, as well as
the absence of mandatory security awareness training for new employees.
The network scan against <code>[Target IP]</code> did not reveal any
open ports or services at the time of assessment, which could indicate a
secure perimeter or an inaccessible target. No pre-existing
vulnerabilities were provided for analysis.</p>
<p>Immediate recommendations focus on implementing robust MFA policies
and establishing a comprehensive security awareness program for all new
hires to significantly mitigate identified risks.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and improve the overall cybersecurity
posture of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, the following
recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Logins:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Mandate Multi-Factor Authentication for
all employee logins to company computers, workstations, and
servers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> This significantly reduces the risk of
unauthorized access even if primary credentials are stolen or
compromised.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> <strong>High</strong></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Extend MFA requirements to all systems,
applications, and databases that store or process sensitive
organizational or customer data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Protects critical information assets
from unauthorized access and data breaches.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> <strong>High</strong></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish New Employee Security Awareness
Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop and implement a mandatory
security awareness training program for all new employees as part of
their onboarding process. This training should cover phishing, malware,
data handling, acceptable use policies, and incident reporting.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Ensures that all personnel, from day
one, are aware of cybersecurity risks and their role in maintaining the
organization’s security.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> <strong>Medium</strong></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Regular Vulnerability Scanning and Penetration
Testing:</strong></p>

<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Regularly perform comprehensive
vulnerability scans and penetration tests on all internet-facing assets
and internal systems to identify and remediate technical
vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Proactively discovers and addresses
security weaknesses before malicious actors can exploit them.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> <strong>Medium</strong></p></li>
