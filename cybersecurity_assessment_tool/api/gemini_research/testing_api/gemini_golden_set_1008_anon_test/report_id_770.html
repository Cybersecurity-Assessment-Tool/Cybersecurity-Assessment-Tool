<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on a comprehensive review of
organizational security controls, a targeted network scan, and an
assessment of existing risks. Key findings indicate significant
vulnerabilities, primarily stemming from a lack of fundamental security
practices such as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and consistent
security awareness training, compounded by critical technical weaknesses
like anonymous FTP access and outdated systems. Immediate and decisive
action is required to mitigate these exposures and enhance the overall
security resilience of the organization.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-security-controls">Analysis of
Security Controls</h2>
<p>The review reveals significant deficiencies in critical security
domains. The complete absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
across email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems represents a
severe vulnerability, leaving the organization highly susceptible to
credential-based attacks. Furthermore, the lack of structured security
awareness training for both new and existing employees significantly
increases the risk of social engineering attacks, phishing campaigns,
and human error contributing to security incidents. While an acceptable
use policy is in place, its effectiveness is likely undermined by the
absence of these foundational security measures and continuous employee
education.</p>

</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of
Technical Findings</h2>
<p>The network scan identified a critical misconfiguration and an severe
vulnerability associated with the FTP service on the target:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Anonymous FTP Access:</strong> The FTP service is
configured to allow anonymous login. This is a severe security
misconfiguration that enables unauthorized users to access the FTP
server without any credentials. This can lead to unauthorized access to
potentially sensitive files, data exfiltration, or even the upload of
malicious content, potentially compromising the integrity and
confidentiality of the system.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Outdated and End-of-Life (EOL) FTP Service:</strong> The
FTP service is running <code>vsftpd</code> version <code>2.3.4</code>.
This version was released in 2011 and is considered end-of-life. Running
EOL software significantly increases the attack surface as it no longer
receives security updates or patches for newly discovered
vulnerabilities. This poses a high risk for remote code execution,
denial-of-service attacks, and other exploits that could lead to system
compromise.</p></li>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are provided to
improve the cybersecurity posture of <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong>. These actions are prioritized by their potential impact
and urgency.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="immediate-critical-actions">Immediate /
Critical Actions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Disable Anonymous FTP Access:</strong> Immediately
disable anonymous login for the FTP service on (Port 21). As a best
practice, verify if the FTP service is truly necessary for business
operations. If not, disable or uninstall it completely to remove this
attack vector.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade or Replace FTP Service:</strong> Replace the
outdated <code>vsftpd 2.3.4</code> with a modern, currently supported,
patched, and securely configured file transfer solution. Consider
migrating to more secure protocols like SFTP or FTPS, or utilize
cloud-based secure file sharing services, enforcing strong
authentication.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="high-priority-actions">High Priority
Actions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Deploy MFA for all email accounts, prioritizing administrative
and executive accounts.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement MFA for all computer logins across the organization’s
network.</p></li>
<li><p>Integrate MFA for access to all sensitive data systems and
applications.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Comprehensive Security Awareness
Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and implement mandatory security awareness training for
all new hires as part of their onboarding process.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct mandatory annual security awareness training for all
employees, covering critical topics such as phishing, social
engineering, password management, data handling best practices, and
incident reporting procedures.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade Outdated Operating Systems:</strong> Prioritize
and execute a plan to upgrade all computers currently running Windows 7
to a currently supported operating system (e.g., Windows 10 or 11). This
should be part of a broader IT asset lifecycle management policy to
prevent future recurrence of EOL software risks.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="general-best-practices">General Best
Practices</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Regular Vulnerability Scanning &amp; Patch
Management:</strong> Implement a routine schedule for internal and
external vulnerability scanning. Establish a robust patch management
program to ensure all systems, applications, and network devices are
kept up-to-date with the latest security patches.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Network Segmentation:</strong> Consider implementing
network segmentation to logically separate critical systems and
sensitive data from general user networks. This can limit lateral
movement of attackers in the event of a breach.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Test an Incident Response Plan:</strong>
Develop, document, and regularly test an incident response plan to
ensure the organization can effectively detect, respond to, contain, and
recover from security incidents in a timely manner.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The current cybersecurity posture of <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong> presents several critical and high-priority risks that
require urgent attention. Addressing the identified gaps in security
controls and technical configurations will significantly reduce the
organization’s attack surface and enhance its ability to withstand and
recover from cyber threats. Proactive and diligent implementation of the
recommended actions is paramount for safeguarding organizational assets,
data, and maintaining business continuity.</p>
