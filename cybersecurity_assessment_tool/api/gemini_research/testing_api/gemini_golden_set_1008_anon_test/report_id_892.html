<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on an analysis of security
controls, network scan results, and existing risks. Overall, the
organization demonstrates a foundational commitment to security, with
strong controls around MFA for computer and sensitive data access, and
annual security awareness training. However, critical gaps exist
concerning Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and
initial security awareness training for new employees, presenting
significant risks. A recent network scan of <code>[Target IP]</code> did
not identify any publicly accessible open ports, which is a positive
finding. No pre-existing vulnerabilities were provided for review. The
recommendations focus on addressing these identified control gaps to
enhance the overall security posture.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was conducted against the specified target. The
objective was to identify any publicly exposed services or potential
vulnerabilities.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP/Hostname:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Status:</strong> The target was found to be
<strong>up</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports and Services:</strong> No open ports were
detected during this scan. All scanned ports were reported as
closed.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This finding is positive, indicating that the external perimeter of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong> does not currently expose any
directly accessible network services from the vantage point of the scan.
This reduces the attack surface for external threats seeking to exploit
known service vulnerabilities.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the security control questionnaire and the
technical scan results, the following risks have been identified. No

<td style="text-align: left;">The absence of Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) for email access significantly elevates the risk of account
compromise through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force
attacks. Email accounts are frequent targets due to the sensitive

<td style="text-align: left;">Failing to provide comprehensive security
awareness training to new employees from day one can lead to early
security missteps, making them susceptible to social engineering attacks

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and strengthen the overall
cybersecurity posture of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, the
following actionable recommendations are provided:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement Mandatory MFA for Email Access:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Enable and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all user
accounts accessing email services. This should be considered a top
priority given the criticality of email in business operations and as a
common vector for initial compromise.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide clear instructions and support for employees to enroll in
and use MFA.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider utilizing hardware tokens or authenticator apps for
stronger authentication methods.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Mandatory Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and implement a mandatory cybersecurity awareness
training program specifically for all new employees as part of their
onboarding process. This training should occur before new hires are
granted access to critical company systems.</p></li>
<li><p>The training content should cover essential topics such as
phishing identification, password best practices, safe browsing habits,
incident reporting procedures, and the organization’s acceptable use
policy.</p></li>
<li><p>Reinforce the importance of security culture from the outset of
their employment.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Continuous Security Control Review and
Updates:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Regularly review and update existing security policies and
controls to adapt to the evolving threat landscape and organizational
changes.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure that all security awareness training, including annual
refreshers, is current and addresses the latest threats and best
practices.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct periodic internal audits of MFA implementation and
security training completion rates.</p></li>
</ul></li>
