<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong> based on a recent network scan,
organizational security questionnaire responses, and a review of
existing risk data. While the recent network scan indicated no open
ports on the target , suggesting a minimal direct attack surface from
the scanned perspective, significant gaps were identified in the
organization’s security awareness training programs. Additionally, a
pre-existing risk regarding an ’Unencrypted Web Server’ was noted,
though the current scan results indicate port 80 is closed, which may
suggest this risk has been remediated or requires re-validation. Key
recommendations include implementing comprehensive security awareness
training and validating the status of historical technical
vulnerabilities.</p>

Scan Results (Network)</h1>
<p>A network scan was conducted on using <code>nmap</code> on
<code>[Scan Date]</code>. The primary goal was to identify open ports
and services, which could indicate potential vulnerabilities.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="summary-of-findings">Summary of Findings</h2>
<p>The target host was found to be up.<br />
No open ports were identified. Specifically, Port 80 is closed. Based on
the provided scan data, no open ports were identified, and port 80 was
explicitly listed as <code>closed</code>. This suggests a well-secured
external network perimeter from the perspective of this specific scan
scope.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the organizational data, security controls,
and technical scan results, the following recommendations are provided
to enhance the cybersecurity posture of <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Implement Mandatory Security Awareness Training for New Hires:
Ensure all new employees receive comprehensive training on security
policies, phishing, social engineering, and data handling before
accessing company systems. This addresses the identified gap in initial
training.</p></li>
<li><p>Establish Annual Security Awareness Training for All Employees:
Conduct mandatory yearly training sessions, including simulated phishing
exercises, to reinforce security best practices and educate on new
threats. This remediates the lack of ongoing security
education.</p></li>
<li><p>Validate Historical Technical Risks: Investigate the ’Unencrypted
Web Server’ risk (CVSS 5.0). Confirm if port 80 was indeed open
previously, if it’s now closed due to remediation, or if the risk refers
to an internal asset not covered by the current external scan (). If a
web server exists internally, ensure it utilizes HTTPS with valid
certificates.</p></li>
<li><p>Regular Network Scanning: Schedule regular internal and external
network scans to identify potential vulnerabilities and track changes in
the attack surface. Although no open ports were found in this scan,
continuous monitoring is crucial.</p></li>
