<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on a review of
organizational security controls, an external network scan, and an
analysis of existing risks. The assessment highlights key strengths,
identified vulnerabilities, and actionable recommendations.</p>
<p>Overall, the organization demonstrates a good foundation in security
awareness and policy enforcement. However, critical gaps were
identified, notably the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
computer logins, which significantly increases the risk of unauthorized
access. Additionally, the network scan revealed a public-facing web
server running a potentially outdated version of Nginx, which could
harbor known vulnerabilities. There were no pre-existing documented
vulnerabilities provided for analysis.</p>
<p>Immediate attention is recommended for implementing MFA for computer
logins and ensuring all public-facing services, especially web servers,
are running the latest stable and patched versions.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The organization demonstrates strong
adherence to security awareness training and policy documentation.
However, a significant gap was identified in the implementation of
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This is a
critical control for preventing unauthorized access even if primary
credentials (e.g., username and password) are compromised through
phishing or other attacks.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was conducted on on <code>2025-11-22</code>.
The scan focused on identifying open ports and associated services.</p>

</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="identified-open-ports-and-services">Identified Open Ports and
Services</h2>
<p>The following open ports and services were identified:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 443 (TCP)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>State:</strong> Open</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Service Name:</strong> HTTPS</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Product:</strong> Nginx</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.18.0</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Details:</strong> This port is commonly used for secure
web traffic (HTTPS). Nginx 1.18.0 is an older stable release of the web
server software (released April 2020). While considered stable, it has
been superseded by newer versions (e.g., 1.24.x, 1.25.x mainline as of
the report generation date) which include security patches and bug
fixes. Running outdated software can expose the system to known
vulnerabilities that have already been addressed in newer
releases.</p></li>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and enhance the overall
cybersecurity posture, the following actionable recommendations are
provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer
Logins (High Priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Deploy a robust MFA solution for all computer login processes
across the organization. This should apply to both local machine access
and network/domain logins.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider integrating MFA with existing identity management
systems (e.g., Active Directory, Azure AD) for streamlined user
experience and centralized management.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct a phased rollout, starting with privileged accounts and
then extending to all users, to minimize disruption and gather
feedback.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide comprehensive user training on MFA usage, including how
to enroll, troubleshoot common issues, and recognize MFA fatigue
attacks.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Update Nginx to the Latest Stable Version (Medium
Priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Plan and execute an upgrade of the Nginx web server to the latest
stable release (e.g., 1.24.x or newer, as of the report date).</p></li>
<li><p>Before deploying to production, thoroughly test the new version
in a staging environment to ensure compatibility with all hosted
applications and services and to prevent operational
disruption.</p></li>
<li><p>Establish a regular patch management schedule for all
public-facing services, actively monitoring official Nginx security
advisories and update release schedules.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Maintain and Enhance Security Awareness Programs
(Ongoing):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Continue the current strong practice of regular security
awareness training for all employees. This training should be engaging
and address current threat vectors such as phishing, social engineering,
ransomware, and the importance of strong, unique passwords.</p></li>
<li><p>Incorporate lessons learned from internal security incidents (if
any) and external threat intelligence into training modules to keep
content relevant and impactful.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Regularly Review and Update Security Policies
(Ongoing):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ensure that the employee acceptable use policy and other
security-related policies are reviewed and updated annually, or whenever
significant changes in technology, organizational structure, or the
threat landscape occur.</p></li>
<li><p>Verify that policies are effectively communicated to all
employees and that acknowledgement of understanding is
recorded.</p></li>
