<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides an assessment of the current cybersecurity
posture for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on an
organizational questionnaire, a technical network scan, and a review of
existing risk data. While some foundational controls are in place,
critical gaps, particularly concerning Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
and consistent security awareness training, have been identified. The
technical scan did not reveal any immediately exploitable open ports on
the target, and notably contradicted a pre-existing risk record
regarding an unencrypted web server. Recommendations are provided to
address identified vulnerabilities and enhance the overall security
posture.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="questionnaire-analysis">Questionnaire
Analysis</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Critical Gaps in MFA:</strong> The absence of MFA for
email access and sensitive data systems represents a significant
vulnerability, increasing the risk of unauthorized access through
compromised credentials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Security Awareness Training:</strong> The
organization does not conduct security awareness training for new
employees or annually for all employees. This leaves the workforce
susceptible to phishing, social engineering, and other common
attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Positive Controls:</strong> An acceptable use policy is
in place, and MFA is required for computer logins, which are good
foundational steps.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on the designated target.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not provided in source data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Target IP/Hostname:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Used:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="summary-of-findings">Summary of Findings</h2>
<p>The Nmap scan indicated that the target host was up, but no open
ports were identified. Specifically, port 80 was found to be
<strong>closed</strong>. This is a positive finding, suggesting that
there are no immediately exposed services on the scanned IP.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section correlates findings from the questionnaire, technical
scan, and pre-existing risk register to provide a comprehensive view of
the current risk landscape.</p>

<strong>Risk Name/Gap</strong> &amp; <strong>Overview</strong> &amp;
<strong>Severity</strong><br />
Lack of MFA for Email &amp; No Multi-Factor Authentication required for
email access, increasing risk of account compromise. &amp; High<br />
Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems &amp; No Multi-Factor
Authentication required for access to sensitive data systems. &amp;
High<br />
No New Hire Security Training &amp; New employees do not receive
security awareness training, making them potential weak links. &amp;
Medium<br />
No Annual Security Training &amp; All employees do not receive annual
security awareness training, leading to potential skill degradation and
vulnerability to new threats. &amp; Medium<br />
<br />
Unencrypted Web Server &amp; Previous risk record indicated Port 80 was
open and unencrypted. <strong>Current Nmap scan shows Port 80 as
CLOSED</strong>, suggesting this risk may be mitigated or the record is
outdated. &amp; Medium<br />
</p>
</div>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are provided to
enhance the organization’s cybersecurity posture:</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="immediate-actions-high-priority">Immediate
Actions (High Priority)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Access:</strong> Mandate
Multi-Factor Authentication for all email accounts to significantly
reduce the risk of unauthorized access due to stolen or weak
credentials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> Extend
MFA requirements to all systems storing or processing sensitive
organizational data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish New Hire Security Awareness Training:</strong>
Develop and implement mandatory security awareness training for all new
employees during their onboarding process.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Annual Security Awareness Training:</strong>
Implement a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all
employees, covering current threats and best practices.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="ongoing-actions-medium-priority">Ongoing
Actions (Medium Priority)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Review and Update Risk Register:</strong> Thoroughly
review and update the existing risk register, specifically addressing
the "Unencrypted Web Server" risk. Confirm the current status of port 80
and other potentially outdated risk entries. If the risk is indeed
mitigated, document the changes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Network Scans:</strong> Implement a schedule for
regular internal and external network vulnerability scans to proactively
identify and address potential exposures.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The cybersecurity posture of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>
demonstrates a foundational understanding of some security principles,
but it is significantly hampered by critical gaps in MFA implementation
and a complete lack of a consistent security awareness training program.
While the recent technical scan showed no immediately exploitable open
ports, these internal process and control weaknesses present a
substantial risk. Addressing these recommendations will significantly
bolster the organization’s defense against common cyber threats.</p>
