<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details a cybersecurity posture assessment for , based on
a security questionnaire, a network scan, and an analysis of
pre-existing risk data. The assessment reveals several critical areas
requiring immediate attention, particularly concerning the inconsistent
implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and insufficient
recurring security awareness training. While the external network scan
did not identify any directly exploitable open ports on the target,
internal control gaps present significant potential for unauthorized
access and data breaches. A previously identified risk regarding an
unencrypted web server needs re-evaluation given the current scan
results indicate the relevant port is closed. Comprehensive and
actionable recommendations are provided to mitigate identified risks and
enhance the organization’s overall security resilience.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-questionnaire-findings">Analysis
of Questionnaire Findings</h2>
<p>The questionnaire responses highlight critical deficiencies in the
organization’s security posture, primarily centered on Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) and ongoing security awareness training:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA Gaps:</strong> The absence of MFA for computer logins
and access to sensitive data systems is a significant vulnerability.
This weakness drastically increases the risk of unauthorized access via
compromised credentials, phishing attacks, or brute-force attempts. It
poses a direct threat to internal network security and sensitive data
integrity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inconsistent Security Awareness Training:</strong>
Although new employees receive training, the lack of annual security
awareness training for all staff means that crucial security knowledge
may not be reinforced or updated. This oversight leaves the organization
vulnerable to evolving cyber threats and sophisticated social
engineering techniques, as employees may not be equipped to recognize
and respond to the latest risks.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was conducted on the designated target to
identify open ports and active services.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Used:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="scan-summary">Scan Summary</h2>
<p>The Nmap scan indicated that the target host was responsive (up).
However, the scan <strong>did not identify any open ports</strong>.
Specifically, port 80, which was cited in a pre-existing risk, was
reported as <code>closed</code>. This finding suggests that, at the time
of the scan, no publicly accessible services were listening on the
scanned IP address.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="detailed-findings">Detailed Findings</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> Up</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports and Services:</strong> None
identified.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: The absence of open ports on the external perimeter reduces
the immediate attack surface from network-based threats. However, this
does not eliminate risks stemming from internal vulnerabilities,
misconfigured web applications on other hosts, or successful social
engineering attacks.</em></p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the comprehensive analysis, the following prioritized
recommendations are provided to significantly enhance the cybersecurity
posture of .</p>
<h2 id="high-priority-recommendations">High Priority
Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Logins:</strong> Immediately
mandate and rigorously enforce Multi-Factor Authentication for all user
logins to organizational computers and workstations. This is a
fundamental step to protect against credential theft, a leading cause of
breaches.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> Extend
MFA requirements to all systems and applications that store, process, or
transmit sensitive organizational or client data. This critical measure
adds robust protection to the most valuable digital assets.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="medium-priority-recommendations">Medium Priority
Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Establish Annual Security Awareness Training:</strong>
Develop and implement a mandatory, annual security awareness training
program for all employees. The training should be comprehensive,
covering current threat landscapes, phishing tactics, data handling best
practices, and organizational security policies, to foster a resilient
human firewall.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Verify "Unencrypted Web Server" Status:</strong>
Investigate the previously identified "Unencrypted Web Server" risk.
Confirm if the associated service was intentionally decommissioned,
moved to a different host/port, or properly secured with HTTPS. If a
public-facing web service is intended, ensure it uses strong encryption
(TLS 1.2+).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="general-security-best-practices">General Security Best
Practices</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Regular Network and Vulnerability Scanning:</strong>
Implement a schedule for regular internal and external network scans and
vulnerability assessments to proactively identify new open ports,
outdated services, and security misconfigurations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Incident Response Plan Development/Testing:</strong>
Ensure a well-documented, actionable, and regularly tested incident
response plan is in place. This plan should clearly define roles,
responsibilities, and procedures for detecting, containing, eradicating,
and recovering from security incidents.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Security Policy Review and Updates:</strong> Periodically
review and update all security policies, including the acceptable use
policy, to ensure they remain current with evolving threats,
technologies, and organizational changes.</p></li>
