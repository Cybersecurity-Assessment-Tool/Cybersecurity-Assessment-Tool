<h2 id="analysis-of-security-control-gaps">Analysis of Security Control
Gaps</h2>
<p>The questionnaire highlights significant deficiencies in foundational
security controls:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> MFA
is not required for email access, computer login, or sensitive data
systems. This represents a critical vulnerability, as compromised
credentials could lead to widespread unauthorized access and data
breaches.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inadequate Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong> New employees are not receiving security awareness
training. This omission increases the likelihood of early-stage
human-factor vulnerabilities due to a lack of understanding of security
policies and best practices.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on <code>[Target IP]</code>. The scan
identified the following critical finding:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP</strong>: <code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Port</strong>: 21/tcp (FTP)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Service/Product/Version</strong>:
<code>ftp/vsftpd 2.3.4</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Key Finding</strong>: The service is identified as
<code>vsftpd 2.3.4</code>. This version of ‘vsftpd‘ was released in 2011
and is extremely outdated. It is known to have critical vulnerabilities,
including potential backdoor entry points (e.g., CVE-2011-2523, though
specific proof of exploit was not conducted). Running such an old
version poses a severe risk of remote code execution or unauthorized
access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Misconfiguration</strong>: The scan also reported
"Anonymous FTP login allowed". This is a critical misconfiguration that
grants unauthorized users read and potentially write access to the FTP
server without any authentication. This could lead to sensitive data
leakage, unauthorized file uploads, or serve as an entry point for
further attacks on the internal network.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of security controls, technical scan results,
and existing organizational risks, the following critical, high, and
moderate priority risks have been identified:</p>

<td style="text-align: left;">Outdated vsftpd with Anonymous FTP</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">An extremely outdated FTP service
(<code>vsftpd 2.3.4</code>) is running on port 21, allowing anonymous
logins. This is a critical remote exploitation vector and data leakage
risk.</td>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and improve the overall
cybersecurity posture, the following actionable recommendations are
provided:</p>
<h2 id="critical-recommendations">Critical Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Decommission or Secure FTP Service
Immediately</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the FTP service is not business-critical, it should be
immediately shut down, disabled, and removed from the system.</p></li>
<li><p>If the FTP service is required, it must be upgraded to the latest
stable version (e.g., <code>vsftpd 3.0.3</code> or newer if available).
Configure it securely by disabling anonymous access, enforcing strong
authentication (e.g., SFTP/FTPS with certificates or strong passwords),
and restricting access from trusted networks only.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct a full vulnerability scan and penetration test on any
reinstated FTP service.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Across All
Critical Systems</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Deploy mandatory MFA for all email access (e.g., via Microsoft
365/Google Workspace security features, or an independent identity
provider).</p></li>
<li><p>Implement mandatory MFA for all computer logins, especially for
administrative accounts (e.g., Windows Hello for Business, third-party
MFA solutions integrated with Active Directory).</p></li>
<li><p>Enforce MFA for access to all sensitive data systems,
applications, and cloud services.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="high-recommendations">High Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Mandatory Security Awareness Training for New
Hires</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Integrate comprehensive security awareness training into the
onboarding process for all new employees, ensuring completion before
they gain system access.</p></li>
<li><p>The training should cover critical topics such as phishing
identification, malware prevention, strong password hygiene, social
engineering tactics, and the organization’s acceptable use
policy.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="moderate-recommendations">Moderate Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade/Migrate Outdated Operating Systems</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and execute a plan to immediately upgrade all Windows 7
machines to a supported operating system (e.g., Windows 10 or 11).
Prioritize machines with access to sensitive data or internet
connectivity.</p></li>
<li><p>For any remaining Windows 7 machines that cannot be immediately
upgraded, isolate them on a separate network segment with strict
firewall rules and limited network access until they can be upgraded or
decommissioned.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The assessment reveals a cybersecurity posture that requires urgent
attention, particularly concerning the critical technical
vulnerabilities associated with the outdated and misconfigured FTP
service, and the fundamental gaps in MFA adoption. Addressing these
issues, alongside implementing comprehensive security awareness training
for new employees and upgrading end-of-life operating systems, will
significantly enhance <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>’s resilience
against common cyber threats. Ongoing monitoring, regular assessments,
and continuous improvement of security controls are essential to
maintain a strong defense against the evolving threat landscape.</p>
