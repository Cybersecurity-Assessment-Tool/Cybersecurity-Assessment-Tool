<p><strong>Cybersecurity Posture Assessment Report</strong></p>
<p><strong>For <strong>[Organization Name]</strong></strong></p>
<p>Date: 2026-01-26</p>
<p>Prepared By: Expert Cybersecurity Analyst</p>
</div>
<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings from a cybersecurity posture
assessment conducted for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The
assessment integrated network scan data, organizational security
questionnaire responses, and pre-existing risk information to provide a
holistic view of the current security landscape.</p>
<p>Key findings include the critical exposure of Remote Desktop Protocol
(RDP) on an externally accessible IP address, identified both through
network scanning and as a documented pre-existing risk. Furthermore,
significant gaps in organizational controls were identified,
specifically regarding the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
computer logins and the absence of security awareness training for new
employees. These areas represent immediate and high-priority risks that
require urgent attention to mitigate potential breaches and enhance the
overall security posture.</p>
<p>Recommendations focus on immediate remediation of RDP exposure,
implementation of robust MFA policies, and establishment of
comprehensive security awareness training programs.</p>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This document outlines the current cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The assessment leverages a
multi-faceted approach, combining technical vulnerability scanning with
an analysis of organizational security practices and existing risk
registers. The goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the
current security landscape, highlight critical vulnerabilities and gaps,
and provide actionable recommendations for improvement.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-questionnaire-findings">Analysis of Questionnaire
Findings</h2>
<p>Based on the responses, two significant gaps in security controls
were identified:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins:</strong> Not requiring
MFA for computer logins significantly increases the risk of unauthorized
access due to compromised credentials, especially for local network
access or VPNs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong> New employees are often prime targets for social
engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) as they may not be fully aware of
organizational security policies and common threat vectors. Absence of
initial training leaves them vulnerable.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed to identify open ports and services.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> <code>[Scan Date]</code> (Specific
date not provided in scan metadata)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>The scan identified the following active hosts and open ports:</p>
<h2 id="open-ports-and-services">Open Ports and Services</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> Up</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Port:</strong> 3389/tcp</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>State:</strong> Open</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Service Name:</strong> ms-wbt-server (Remote Desktop
Protocol - RDP)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Product/Version:</strong> Not identified by
scanner</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="technical-analysis">Technical Analysis</h3>
<p>The discovery of an open RDP port (3389/tcp) is a critical finding.
RDP, if exposed directly to the internet without proper security
measures (such as VPN access, strong unique passwords, and ideally MFA),
is a frequent target for brute-force attacks and exploitation. This port
can be used by attackers to gain initial access to systems, which can
then lead to further network compromise. The lack of identified
product/version could mean it’s a generic RDP service or Nmap couldn’t
determine the specifics, but the exposure remains a severe risk
regardless.</p>

<p>This section synthesizes findings from the security control review,
technical scans, and pre-existing risk data to provide a consolidated

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following recommendations are provided to address the identified
risks and improve <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>’s overall
cybersecurity posture. These are categorized by risk to provide
actionable steps.</p>
<h2 id="rdp-exposure">RDP Exposure</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Fix: Close Port 3389 Externally.</strong> The
most direct and immediate mitigation is to block external access to port
3389 on any perimeter firewalls. RDP should ideally only be accessible
from within the internal network.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Long-Term Fix: Implement VPN for RDP Access.</strong> For
necessary external RDP access, mandate that all connections pass through
a robust Virtual Private Network (VPN). The VPN itself should be secured
with strong authentication, including MFA.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Strengthen RDP Security:</strong> If RDP must be directly
exposed (not recommended), ensure it is protected by strong, unique
passwords, account lockout policies, network-level authentication (NLA),
and ideally, an RDP gateway with MFA integration. Regular patching of
the underlying operating system is also crucial.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lack-of-mfa-for-computer-logins">Lack of MFA for Computer
Logins</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for All Computer Logins.</strong> Deploy
and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication for all user accounts logging
into internal workstations and servers. This significantly reduces the
risk of credential theft leading to unauthorized access. Consider
hardware tokens, authenticator apps, or smart cards.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Phased Rollout:</strong> If immediate full deployment is
challenging, prioritize implementation for administrative accounts,
accounts with access to sensitive data, and externally accessible
systems.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lack-of-security-awareness-training-for-new-employees">Lack of
Security Awareness Training for New Employees</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Mandatory Onboarding Security Training.</strong> Develop
and implement a mandatory security awareness training program for all
new employees during their onboarding process. This training should
cover topics such as phishing, malware, password best practices,
physical security, and reporting suspicious activities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Refresher Training:</strong> Ensure that this
initial training is reinforced with regular, annual security awareness
training for all employees (as already stated to be in place).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Phishing Simulations:</strong> Consider conducting
regular simulated phishing campaigns to test employee vigilance and
reinforce training concepts.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The cybersecurity posture assessment for <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong> reveals critical vulnerabilities and control gaps that
require immediate attention. The external exposure of RDP, coupled with
the absence of MFA for computer logins and initial security awareness
training for new employees, presents a significant attack surface. By
diligently implementing the recommendations outlined in this report,
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong> can substantially enhance its
resilience against cyber threats, reduce the likelihood of successful
attacks, and protect its valuable assets.</p>
