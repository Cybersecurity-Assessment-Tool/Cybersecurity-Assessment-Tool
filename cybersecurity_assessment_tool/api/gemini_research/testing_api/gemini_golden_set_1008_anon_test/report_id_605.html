<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings from a cybersecurity posture
assessment for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on provided
network scan data, organizational security questionnaire responses, and
pre-existing risk information. The assessment reveals several critical
security control gaps, most notably the lack of Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data system access, and the
absence of a formal Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). Furthermore, a recent
network scan confirmed the public exposure of a Remote Desktop Protocol
(RDP) service, correlating with a pre-existing high-severity risk. While
some security awareness training is in place, the overall posture
indicates a need for immediate and sustained improvements to mitigate
significant attack vectors and enhance organizational resilience against
cyber threats.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<h2 id="nmap-scan-summary">Nmap Scan Summary</h2>
<p>A recent network scan was conducted, targeting . The scan identified
the following open port and service:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 3389/TCP - <code>ms-wbt-server</code> (Microsoft
Remote Desktop Protocol)</strong>: This service was found to be open and
accessible. RDP is a widely used protocol for remote administration, but
its exposure to the internet, especially without robust security
measures like Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) or VPN-only access,
makes it a frequent target for attackers. This can lead to brute-force
attacks, credential theft, and unauthorized access to internal
systems.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>No specific product versions were identified by the scanner for this
service in the provided data, precluding an immediate assessment of
known vulnerabilities related to outdated software.</p>

<h2 id="identified-security-control-gaps">Identified Security Control
Gaps</h2>
<p>Based on the security questionnaire responses, several critical
security control gaps were identified, significantly increasing
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>’s attack surface and risk
profile:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Email Access:</strong> Without
Multi-Factor Authentication for email accounts, these are highly
susceptible to credential stuffing, phishing, and brute-force attacks. A
compromised email account can lead to business email compromise (BEC),
data exfiltration, and lateral movement within the network.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> Similar
to email, systems containing sensitive organizational data are at high
risk of unauthorized access if not protected by MFA. This could result
in severe data breaches, regulatory penalties, and reputational
damage.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> The lack
of a formal AUP means employees may not be fully aware of their
responsibilities regarding the use of company IT resources, internet
access, and data handling. This can increase the risk of insider
threats, misuse of company assets, and non-compliance.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To enhance the overall cybersecurity posture of <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong>, the following actionable recommendations are provided,
categorized by priority.</p>
<h2 id="immediate-actions-high-priority">Immediate Actions (High
Priority)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Secure RDP Exposure:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Restrict Internet Access:</strong> Immediately implement
firewall rules to block direct external access to Port 3389 (RDP) on
.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement VPN Gateway:</strong> For necessary remote
access to internal resources, mandate the use of a Virtual Private
Network (VPN) with strong authentication (preferably MFA) as the sole
entry point.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Strong Authentication:</strong> Ensure all RDP user
accounts utilize strong, unique passwords, and implement account lockout
policies to deter brute-force attempts.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Access:</strong> Deploy and
enforce Multi-Factor Authentication for all email accounts across the
organization. This is a fundamental control against credential
theft.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> Extend
MFA requirements to all systems and applications that handle or store
sensitive organizational data.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mid-term-actions">Mid-Term Actions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a comprehensive AUP that clearly outlines
employee responsibilities, acceptable use of IT resources, data
handling, and security expectations. Ensure all employees review,
understand, and acknowledge this policy annually.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Patch and Vulnerability Management:</strong> Establish a
robust patch management program to ensure all operating systems,
applications, and network devices, especially those externally exposed,
are consistently updated with the latest security patches.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Configuration Reviews:</strong> Conduct periodic
reviews of firewall rules, server configurations, and access controls to
ensure they adhere to security best practices and organizational
policies.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="long-term-actions">Long-Term Actions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Expand Security Awareness Training:</strong> While
general training is provided, consider expanding the scope to include
more advanced topics such as identifying sophisticated phishing
attempts, secure remote work practices, and data privacy best practices.
Conduct phishing simulations regularly.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:</strong>
Schedule periodic external and internal security audits and penetration
tests to proactively identify vulnerabilities and validate the
effectiveness of implemented security controls.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Incident Response Plan Development:</strong> Develop,
document, and regularly test an Incident Response Plan (IRP) to ensure
the organization can effectively detect, respond to, and recover from
cybersecurity incidents.</p></li>
