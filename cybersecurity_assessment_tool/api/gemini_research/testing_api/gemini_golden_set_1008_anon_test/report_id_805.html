<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive assessment of the cybersecurity
posture based on a review of organizational security controls, technical
scan results, and reported pre-existing risks. The current posture is
assessed as <strong>Moderate</strong>, demonstrating good foundational
security practices in some areas while highlighting critical gaps and
potential vulnerabilities in others.</p>
<p>Strengths include the implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) for email and sensitive data systems, a robust acceptable use
policy, and regular security awareness training for employees. However,
a significant vulnerability was identified due to the lack of MFA for
computer logins, which represents a critical risk to endpoint security.
Furthermore, an outdated web server software version was detected during
the technical scan, posing a potential vector for exploitation. No
pre-existing vulnerabilities were reported in the provided data.
Addressing the identified risks and implementing the recommended actions
is crucial for enhancing the overall security resilience.</p>

Technical Findings</h3>
<p>The Nginx web server running on port 443 is identified as version
<code>1.18.0</code>. Nginx 1.18.x is an older stable branch that reached
end-of-life for mainline support in 2021 and for stable in early 2022.
Running outdated software can expose the organization to known
vulnerabilities for which patches exist in newer versions. This
represents a <strong>Medium</strong> severity risk.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>

<h2 id="immediate-actions-high-severity">Immediate Actions (High
Severity)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Endpoint Access:</strong> Mandate and
deploy Multi-Factor Authentication for all user accounts logging into
computers, workstations, and servers. This is critical to prevent
unauthorized access from compromised credentials.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="mid-term-actions-medium-severity">Mid-Term Actions (Medium
Severity)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade Nginx Web Server:</strong> Plan and execute an
upgrade of the Nginx web server on port 443 to the latest stable and
supported version. Prioritize this to ensure all known security
vulnerabilities are patched.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Patch Management:</strong> Establish and enforce
a robust patch management policy for all operating systems,
applications, and network devices. Ensure timely application of security
updates and patches.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="general-best-practices">General Best Practices</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Regular Vulnerability Scanning:</strong> Conduct regular
internal and external vulnerability scans to proactively identify and
address security weaknesses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Security Configuration Review:</strong> Periodically
review the security configurations of all systems and services to ensure
they adhere to security best practices and organizational
policies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Incident Response Plan Review:</strong> Ensure an
up-to-date and tested incident response plan is in place to effectively
handle potential security breaches.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>While the organization has implemented several commendable security
controls, particularly in MFA for sensitive systems and security
awareness, critical gaps remain. The absence of MFA for computer logins
and the presence of outdated web server software are significant risks
that warrant immediate attention. By systematically addressing these
recommendations, the organization can significantly strengthen its
cybersecurity defenses and reduce its overall risk exposure.</p>
