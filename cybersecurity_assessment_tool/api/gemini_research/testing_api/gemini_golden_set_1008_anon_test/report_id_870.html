<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides an assessment of the current cybersecurity
posture for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on a review of
organizational security controls, a targeted network scan, and an
analysis of pre-existing risk data.</p>
<p>A positive finding is that the recent network scan of
<code>[Target IP]</code> did not identify any open ports, suggesting a
strong external perimeter for the scanned services. However, a critical
gap was identified in the organization’s security controls: Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) is not required for accessing sensitive data
systems, significantly increasing the risk of unauthorized access.
Furthermore, there is a discrepancy between a pre-existing risk (Port 80
open) and current scan results (Port 80 closed) which requires
clarification.</p>
<p>Overall, while the external network footprint appears minimal, the
lack of MFA for sensitive data poses a significant internal threat.
Immediate action is recommended to implement MFA and to reconcile the
organization’s risk register with current technical findings.</p>

<h2 id="identified-gaps-and-new-findings">Identified Gaps and New
Findings</h2>
<p>Based on the comprehensive analysis, the following key findings and
gaps have been identified:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Critical Gap: Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data
Systems:</strong> The organization currently does not require
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access sensitive data systems. This
significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials
are compromised through phishing, malware, or other means. This is a
critical vulnerability that could lead to data breaches.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Positive Finding: No Open Ports on Scanned
Target:</strong> The recent network scan did not identify any open ports
on the target . This indicates a well-secured perimeter from an external
network perspective for the services scanned.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Discrepancy in Risk Register:</strong> The existing risk
pertaining to an "Unencrypted Web Server" (Port 80 open) contradicts the
current scan results showing Port 80 as closed. This highlights a
potential need for better synchronization between vulnerability
management processes and risk register updates.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following recommendations are provided to address the identified
gaps and strengthen the overall cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems (High
Priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Immediately implement and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) for all access to systems containing sensitive data. This is a
critical control to prevent unauthorized access, even if user
credentials are stolen.</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluate existing MFA solutions or deploy new ones that integrate
seamlessly with your sensitive data systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct user training on the importance and usage of
MFA.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Review and Update Risk Register (High
Priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Conduct an immediate review of the organization’s risk register,
specifically focusing on the "Unencrypted Web Server" risk.</p></li>
<li><p>Determine if the risk is outdated, has been remediated, or if it
pertains to a different asset not covered in the recent scan.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all identified risks accurately reflect the current state
of assets and controls. Implement a process for regular reconciliation
of scan results with the risk register.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Maintain Strong External Perimeter:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Continue the practice of keeping all unnecessary ports closed on
external-facing systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Regularly perform external vulnerability scans to ensure no new
open ports or services are inadvertently exposed.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Continuous Security Awareness Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>While already in practice, ensure that security awareness
training emphasizes the importance of MFA, secure access practices, and
identifying social engineering attempts that target credentials for
sensitive systems.</p></li>
</ul></li>
