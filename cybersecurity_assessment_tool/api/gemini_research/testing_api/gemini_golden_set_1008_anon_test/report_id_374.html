<p>This report provides a comprehensive assessment of the current
cybersecurity posture for , synthesized from a network scan,
organizational security questionnaire responses, and a review of
existing risks. The analysis reveals several critical vulnerabilities
and high-risk gaps that demand immediate attention. Key findings include
a severely outdated and highly vulnerable FTP service with anonymous
access enabled on , a significant gap in initial security awareness
training for new employees, and the continued operation of end-of-life
operating systems. Addressing these identified risks is paramount to
substantially reducing the organization’s attack surface and bolstering

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-questionnaire-responses">Analysis
of Questionnaire Responses:</h2>
<p>The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to multi-factor
authentication (MFA) and has established an acceptable use policy.
However, the absence of initial security awareness training for new
employees (SC-05) presents a significant human-factor vulnerability. New
hires, without proper security education, are more susceptible to social
engineering, phishing, and other targeted attacks, potentially serving
as an inadvertent entry point for malicious actors.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A targeted network scan was performed against . The scan identified
an open FTP service running a critically outdated and vulnerable
software version, further compounded by lax access controls.</p>

<li><p><strong>Version:</strong> 2.3.4</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Script Output:</strong> Anonymous FTP login
allowed</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Finding Details:</strong> The FTP service running vsftpd
version 2.3.4 is extremely outdated and known to harbor a critical
backdoor vulnerability (CVE-2011-2523), which allows for arbitrary
command execution. This vulnerability can lead to complete system
compromise. Furthermore, the allowance of anonymous FTP login without
authentication significantly increases the risk, potentially enabling
unauthorized data access, modification, or the planting of malicious
files, even without exploiting the backdoor. This represents a critical
technical exposure.</p></li>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the identified risks, the following prioritized
recommendations are provided to enhance the cybersecurity posture of
.</p>
<h2 id="immediate-actions-critical-priority">Immediate Actions (Critical
Priority)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Secure or Decommission FTP Service on :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Critical Action:</strong> Immediately disable anonymous
FTP access. Ensure that only authenticated users with strong credentials
can access the service, if at all.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Critical Action:</strong> If FTP is not absolutely
essential for business operations, disable or uninstall the service
entirely to remove the attack vector.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Critical Action:</strong> If FTP functionality is
required, upgrade vsftpd to a current, patched, and supported version,
or migrate to a more secure file transfer protocol such as SFTP (SSH
File Transfer Protocol) or FTPS (FTP over SSL/TLS), ensuring strong
authentication and encryption are utilized.</p></li>
<li><p>Review and enforce strict access control lists (ACLs) on the FTP
server’s directories to adhere to the principle of least privilege,
minimizing potential data exposure.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Mandatory Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and integrate a comprehensive security awareness training
program into the onboarding process for all new hires. This training
should be mandatory before granting network or system access.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure the training covers essential topics such as phishing
detection, social engineering tactics, strong password hygiene, data
handling policies, and proper incident reporting procedures.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mid-term-actions-high-priority">Mid-Term Actions (High
Priority)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade Outdated Operating Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and execute a phased plan to upgrade all workstations
currently running Windows 7 to a modern, supported operating system
(e.g., Windows 10 or 11).</p></li>
<li><p>Prioritize the upgrade of systems handling sensitive data, those
with network exposure, or those used by key personnel.</p></li>
<li><p>For any Windows 7 machines that cannot be immediately upgraded,
implement compensating controls such as network segmentation, enhanced
endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions, and strict firewall
rules to isolate them from the rest of the network.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Regular Vulnerability Scanning
Program:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement a schedule for regular, automated vulnerability scans
of all internal and external-facing assets.</p></li>
<li><p>Establish clear procedures for reviewing scan results,
prioritizing findings based on severity, and promptly remediating
identified vulnerabilities.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="long-term-strategic-actions-ongoing-priority">Long-Term
Strategic Actions (Ongoing Priority)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Continuous Security Training and
Reinforcement:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Beyond annual training, implement ongoing security awareness
campaigns, regular phishing simulations, and frequent internal
communications to reinforce secure behaviors and keep employees vigilant
against evolving threats.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Robust Patch Management Program:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Establish and maintain a comprehensive patch management program

Testing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Regularly review and update the organization’s incident response
plan to address new and emerging threat vectors.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct periodic tabletop exercises and simulations to test the
effectiveness of the incident response plan and ensure all relevant
personnel are familiar with their roles and responsibilities during a
security incident.</p></li>
