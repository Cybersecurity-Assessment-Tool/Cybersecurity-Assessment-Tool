<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive assessment of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>’s current cybersecurity posture,
synthesizing findings from network scans, organizational security
questionnaires, and existing risk registers. Our analysis reveals
several critical vulnerabilities and security gaps that require
immediate attention. Key findings include the presence of severely
outdated and insecure services, critical misconfigurations, and
significant deficiencies in recurring security awareness training, all
of which elevate the organization’s risk profile. While some
foundational controls are in place, crucial areas need strengthening to
protect against evolving cyber threats. Addressing these issues
systematically will significantly enhance overall cybersecurity
resilience.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-security-controls">Analysis of Security
Controls</h2>
<p>The organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
across critical access points and maintains an acceptable use policy and
initial security awareness training for new employees. These are
positive foundational controls. However, a significant gap exists in
recurring security awareness training for all employees. This lack of
continuous education is a critical vulnerability, as it leaves the
organization susceptible to social engineering attacks, phishing, and
other human-factor exploits over time.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was conducted on <code>[Target IP]</code>. The scan
identified the following open ports and services:</p>
<h2 id="host-target-ip">Host: <code>[Target IP]</code></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Status:</strong> Up</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Port 21/TCP (FTP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Service:</strong> FTP</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Product:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Configuration Issue:</strong> Anonymous FTP login
allowed.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="technical-analysis">Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>The identification of on port 21 is a severe concern. This version of
vsftpd was released in 2011 and is known to contain critical
vulnerabilities, including a backdoor (CVE-2011-2523) that allows remote
command execution. Running such an outdated and compromised service
poses an extreme risk to the organization, potentially allowing
attackers full control over the affected system.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the configuration allowing "Anonymous FTP login"
exacerbates this risk by permitting unauthenticated access to the FTP
server. This could lead to unauthorized data access, leakage, or even
further system compromise if writable directories are accessible.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the combined analysis of the organizational questionnaire,
technical scan, and existing risk register, the following risks have
been identified:</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and strengthen the cybersecurity
posture, the following recommendations are provided:</p>
<h2 id="immediate-actions-critical-high-risks">Immediate Actions
(Critical &amp; High Risks)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Decommission/Upgrade Outdated FTP Service:</strong>
Immediately identify the system hosting . If FTP functionality is not
critical, decommission the service. If required, upgrade to a current,
patched, and supported FTP server version (e.g., ProFTPD, Pure-FTPd, or
a modern SFTP/FTPS solution) and ensure it is properly
configured.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Disable Anonymous FTP Access:</strong> If the FTP service
cannot be immediately decommissioned or upgraded, disable anonymous
login access as an urgent interim measure. Implement strong
authentication and authorization controls for all FTP users.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Annual Security Awareness Training:</strong>
Establish and enforce a mandatory annual (or more frequent) security
awareness training program for all employees. This training should cover
phishing, social engineering, password hygiene, data handling, and
incident reporting.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="mid-term-actions-medium-risks">Mid-Term Actions (Medium
Risks)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade Outdated Windows Systems:</strong> Prioritize and
execute a plan to upgrade all Windows 7 machines to a currently
supported operating system (e.g., Windows 10 or 11). This will ensure
systems receive critical security updates and patches.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Vulnerability Scanning:</strong> Implement a
schedule for regular, authenticated vulnerability scans of internal and
external networks to proactively identify and address security
weaknesses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Patch Management Policy:</strong> Develop and enforce a
comprehensive patch management policy to ensure all operating systems,
applications, and network devices are kept up-to-date with the latest
security patches.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="long-term-strategic-recommendations">Long-Term Strategic
Recommendations</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Security Awareness Culture:</strong> Foster a strong
culture of cybersecurity awareness throughout the organization,
extending beyond just annual training, through regular communications,
simulated phishing campaigns, and accessible resources.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):</strong> Implement
EDR solutions on all workstations and servers to enhance threat
detection, investigation, and response capabilities, providing advanced
protection against sophisticated attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Incident Response Plan Review:</strong> Periodically
review and test the organization’s incident response plan through
tabletop exercises and drills to ensure readiness for potential cyber
incidents and minimize their impact.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The assessment highlights critical security deficiencies,
particularly concerning outdated software, misconfigurations, and gaps
in employee training. Addressing these issues systematically, starting
with the immediate and high-risk recommendations, is crucial for
significantly enhancing <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>’s overall
cybersecurity posture and reducing its exposure to potential
cyberattacks. Continuous monitoring, regular assessments, and a
proactive approach to security are essential for long-term resilience in
the face of evolving cyber threats.</p>
