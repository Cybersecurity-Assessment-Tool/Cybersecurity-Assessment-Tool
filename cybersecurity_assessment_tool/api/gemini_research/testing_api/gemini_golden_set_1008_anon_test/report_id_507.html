<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on an analysis of provided
network scan data, organizational security questionnaire responses, and
pre-existing risk information. The organization demonstrates a
commendable commitment to several security controls, including
multi-factor authentication for critical systems and initial security
awareness training. However, a significant gap exists in recurring
annual security awareness training for all employees. Furthermore, a
critical technical vulnerability was identified: a MySQL database port
(3306) is exposed directly to the network, posing a high risk of
unauthorized access and data compromise. Urgent recommendations include
implementing network access restrictions for the database and
establishing a robust annual security awareness training program.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-security-controls">Analysis of
Security Controls</h2>
<p>The organization has implemented strong foundational controls,
particularly regarding Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across email,
computer logins, and sensitive data systems. An acceptable use policy
and initial security awareness training for new employees are also
positive indicators.</p>
<p>However, a critical gap is the <strong>lack of annual security
awareness training for all employees</strong>. This represents a
significant risk, as human error remains one of the leading causes of
security incidents. Without regular reinforcement, employees may forget
best practices, fall victim to phishing attempts, or inadvertently
expose sensitive information.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed using Nmap, targeting .</p>

<li><p><strong>Service:</strong> MySQL</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Version:</strong> 5.7.33</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of
Technical Findings</h2>
<p>The most significant technical finding is the exposure of MySQL port
3306 directly to the network. While MySQL version 5.7.33 is not the
absolute latest, it is still a supported version. The primary concern is
not necessarily the version number itself, but the fact that a database
service is directly accessible from the network without apparent
filtering or access controls. This configuration makes the database
highly vulnerable to unauthorized access, brute-force attacks, and
exploitation of any underlying vulnerabilities by external threat
actors.</p>

identified:</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and strengthen the overall
cybersecurity posture, the following recommendations are provided:</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="immediate-actions-high-priority">Immediate
Actions (High Priority)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Restrict Database Access:</strong> Implement strict
firewall rules to limit access to MySQL port 3306 () to only authorized
internal IP addresses or secure network segments. Public exposure of
database services should always be avoided.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Annual Security Awareness Training:</strong>
Develop and mandate a comprehensive annual security awareness training
program for all employees. This training should cover topics such as
phishing, social engineering, password hygiene, data handling, and
incident reporting.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="long-term-strategies">Long-Term
Strategies</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Secure Remote Database Access:</strong> For any
legitimate remote administration needs, consider implementing a Virtual
Private Network (VPN) or SSH tunneling to securely access the database
server, rather than direct exposure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Vulnerability Scanning:</strong> Establish a
schedule for regular internal and external vulnerability scanning to
proactively identify and address potential weaknesses in network
services and applications.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Patch Management for Database Systems:</strong> Ensure
that the MySQL server, operating system, and all related software are
kept up-to-date with the latest security patches to protect against
known vulnerabilities.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>While <strong>[Organization Name]</strong> has a good foundation in
some security controls, the open MySQL port and the absence of recurring
security awareness training represent significant vulnerabilities that
require immediate attention. Addressing these critical issues will
substantially enhance the organization’s defense against cyber threats
and protect its valuable data assets. Regular review and adaptation of
security practices are crucial for maintaining a robust security posture
in an evolving threat landscape.</p>
