<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">1. Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on an organizational
security questionnaire and a review of existing vulnerabilities. Due to
the limited scope of provided technical data (no active network scan
results for <code>[Target IP]</code>) and the absence of pre-existing
vulnerabilities, this assessment primarily focuses on critical control
gaps identified through the security questionnaire. The organization
demonstrates some foundational security practices but has significant
deficiencies in critical areas such as multi-factor authentication for
computer access, the establishment of an acceptable use policy, and
initial security awareness training for new employees. Addressing these
identified gaps is crucial for enhancing the overall security posture
and mitigating potential risks.</p>

<p>No active network scan data was provided for

<td style="text-align: left;">High</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The absence of Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) for computer logins significantly increases the risk of
unauthorized access in the event of compromised credentials (e.g., via
phishing or brute-force attacks). This is a critical control gap.</td>

(AUP)</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">High</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Without an AUP, employees lack clear
guidelines regarding the appropriate use of organizational assets, data,

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">6. Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and enhance the overall cybersecurity
posture, the following recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer
Logins:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Deploy and enforce MFA for all employee and administrative
computer logins across the organization.</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluate various MFA solutions (e.g., authenticator apps,
hardware tokens, biometrics) to select one that best fits the
organization’s operational needs and security requirements.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide comprehensive training to employees on how to use MFA
effectively.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Draft a clear, concise, and comprehensive AUP that outlines
acceptable and unacceptable use of company information systems,
networks, data, and other IT resources.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure the AUP covers topics such as data handling, internet
usage, email etiquette, software installation, personal device usage
(BYOD), and incident reporting.</p></li>
<li><p>Obtain formal acknowledgment from all employees that they have
read, understood, and agree to adhere to the AUP. Integrate this into
the onboarding process.</p></li>
<li><p>Periodically review and update the AUP to reflect changes in
technology, threats, and organizational policies.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Mandatory Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Integrate a dedicated security awareness training module into the
onboarding process for all new hires, to be completed before they gain
access to company systems.</p></li>
<li><p>This initial training should cover fundamental security topics,
including phishing recognition, password best practices, physical
security, data classification, and the importance of the AUP.</p></li>
<li><p>Supplement this with regular refresher training as part of the
annual security awareness program.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct a Comprehensive Technical Vulnerability
Assessment:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Perform regular external and internal vulnerability scans and
penetration tests on all internet-facing assets and internal
networks.</p></li>
<li><p>This will identify technical vulnerabilities, misconfigurations,
and outdated software versions that could be exploited by attackers,
providing a more complete picture of the technical risk
landscape.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">7. Conclusion</h1>
<p>While the organization has some security controls in place, the
current assessment highlights critical gaps, particularly in
foundational areas such as MFA for computer access, acceptable use
policies, and initial security awareness training for new staff.
Addressing these deficiencies proactively, in conjunction with future
technical assessments, will significantly strengthen the organization’s
defense against common cyber threats and enhance its overall
resilience.</p>
