<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on an assessment of
organizational security controls, an external network scan, and a review
of reported vulnerabilities. The organization demonstrates a commendable
foundation in implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across
critical access points (email, computer login, sensitive data systems)
and conducts annual security awareness training. However, a significant
high-risk gap was identified: the absence of mandatory security
awareness training for new employees during their onboarding process.
This oversight exposes the organization to increased social engineering
and phishing risks from new hires. The external network scan did not
identify any immediate open ports or services, suggesting a limited
external attack surface. No pre-existing vulnerabilities were reported
by the organization. Addressing the new employee training deficiency is
paramount to reducing human-factor risks and strengthening the overall
security posture.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="key-findings-from-questionnaire">Key Findings
from Questionnaire</h2>
<p>The organization has robust controls around Multi-Factor
Authentication for various access points, which significantly enhances
account security. The presence of an acceptable use policy and annual
security awareness training for all employees are also positive
indicators. However, a critical vulnerability exists with the lack of
initial security awareness training for new employees, leaving them
unprepared for common cyber threats during their critical onboarding
period.</p>

<p>The provided network scan data was empty and did not identify any
open ports, running services, or associated product versions on the

internal-only target, or that the scan was
inconclusive/incomplete/empty. Without further detailed scan
information, no specific technical vulnerabilities related to network
services can be reported at this time.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the comprehensive assessment, the following actionable
recommendations are provided to enhance the security posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Mandatory Security Awareness Training for New
Hires (High Priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop or procure a standardized, engaging security awareness
training module specifically designed for new employees.</p></li>
<li><p>Integrate this training as a mandatory component of the
onboarding process, requiring completion before new employees are
granted full access to internal systems and sensitive data.</p></li>
<li><p>The training should cover foundational topics such as:
identifying phishing and social engineering attempts, strong password
practices, acceptable use of company assets, reporting suspicious
activities, and proper handling of sensitive information.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider a short quiz or acknowledgement form to ensure
comprehension.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Enhance and Regularly Review Security
Policies:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Conduct periodic reviews (at least annually) of the employee
acceptable use policy and other security-related policies to ensure they
remain current with evolving threat landscapes and technological
changes.</p></li>
<li><p>Clearly communicate any policy updates to all employees and
obtain documented acknowledgment where necessary.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Consider Comprehensive Technical Security
Assessments:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>While the provided external scan was inconclusive/empty, it is
recommended to conduct more comprehensive and regular penetration tests
and vulnerability assessments. These should include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Internal network vulnerability scanning and penetration
testing.</p></li>
<li><p>Web application security testing (if applicable).</p></li>
<li><p>Cloud security configuration reviews (if cloud services are
utilized).</p></li>
<li><p>Host-based vulnerability assessments on critical servers and
workstations.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These assessments provide a deeper understanding of the
organization’s attack surface and potential internal
vulnerabilities.</p></li>
</ul></li>
