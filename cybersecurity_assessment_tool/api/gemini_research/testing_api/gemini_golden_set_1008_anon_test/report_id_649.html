<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture assessment for
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on an organizational
questionnaire, a network scan, and a review of reported pre-existing
risks. The assessment identified several critical security gaps and
vulnerabilities that require immediate attention.</p>
<p>Key findings include a significant lack of Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) across critical access points (email, computer
login, sensitive data systems), an absence of security awareness
training for new employees, and the presence of an End-of-Life (EOL)
Nginx web server. These issues collectively represent a high risk to the
organization’s information assets, potentially leading to unauthorized
access, data breaches, and operational disruption. Urgent remediation
efforts are highly recommended to bolster the organization’s security
defenses and reduce its overall risk profile.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-security-control-gaps">Analysis
of Security Control Gaps</h2>
<p>The questionnaire revealed several critical gaps in security
controls, primarily concerning Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and
employee security awareness:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>High Risk: Lack of MFA for Email Access</strong> – This
leaves critical email accounts vulnerable to credential-based attacks,
as a single compromised password could grant full access, leading to
phishing, impersonation, and data exfiltration.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>High Risk: Lack of MFA for Computer Login</strong> –
Without MFA for computer logins, unauthorized users could gain access to
internal systems and networks through compromised credentials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>High Risk: Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data
Systems</strong> – Critical systems containing sensitive data are at
severe risk if MFA is not enforced, potentially leading to data breaches
and regulatory non-compliance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>High Risk: No Security Awareness Training for New
Employees</strong> – New employees are not receiving essential security
awareness training, significantly increasing the risk of social
engineering attacks, policy violations, and accidental data exposure
during their initial period.</p></li>

Vulnerability Analysis</h2>
<p>The network scan identified one critical technical vulnerability:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Outdated Nginx Web Server (Version 1.18.0)</strong>: The
web server running on port 443 is Nginx version 1.18.0. This version
reached End-of-Life (EOL) in May 2021. Running EOL software is a
critical security risk as it no longer receives security updates,
leaving it vulnerable to newly discovered exploits. This can lead to web
application compromise, data breaches, or denial of service. Current
stable versions of Nginx are significantly newer (e.g., 1.24.x or
1.26.x).</p></li>

data.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the assessment, the following recommendations are provided
to enhance the organization’s cybersecurity posture:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Universally:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Mandate MFA for all email access, computer
logins, and access to sensitive data systems. Prioritize systems with
access to critical data or administrative privileges.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
access even if passwords are compromised, providing a crucial layer of
defense against credential theft.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Enhance Security Awareness Training Program:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Introduce mandatory security awareness training
for all new employees during their onboarding process, covering
fundamental security practices and policies.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Regularly update and conduct annual security
awareness training for all staff, covering current threats such as
phishing, social engineering, ransomware, password hygiene, and proper
incident reporting procedures.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Empowers employees to recognize and report
threats, fostering a security-conscious culture and reducing the human
element risk in security incidents.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade and Patch Web Servers (Nginx):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Immediately upgrade the Nginx web server
(currently version 1.18.0) to a current, supported stable release (e.g.,
Nginx 1.24.x or newer mainline versions) to ensure it receives critical
security patches and bug fixes.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Implement a robust patching and vulnerability
management program for all software, operating systems, and network
devices, ensuring timely application of security updates.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Addresses known vulnerabilities, reduces the
attack surface, prevents exploitation of outdated software flaws, and
maintains compatibility with modern security standards.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Regular Vulnerability Assessments and Penetration
Testing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Schedule periodic external and internal
vulnerability assessments and penetration tests to proactively identify
and address security weaknesses before they can be exploited by
malicious actors.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Provides an independent review of security
controls, helps validate the effectiveness of implemented defenses, and
identifies potential attack vectors.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Review Security Policies:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Ensure all security policies, including the
Acceptable Use Policy, are current, clearly communicated to all
employees, and regularly reviewed (at least annually) to reflect the
evolving threat landscape and organizational needs.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Establishes clear guidelines for secure
behavior, promotes accountability within the organization, and provides
a framework for consistent security practices.</p></li>
</ul></li>
