<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The assessment was
primarily based on a review of key security controls via a
questionnaire. Due to incomplete input data, no external network scan
results or pre-existing vulnerability register could be incorporated
into this analysis.</p>
<p>The current posture reveals several critical gaps, particularly
concerning Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) implementation for email
and sensitive data systems, as well as the absence of essential security
policies and initial security awareness training for new employees.
These deficiencies represent significant risks that require immediate
attention to enhance the organization’s overall security resilience.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified gaps and enhance the overall cybersecurity
posture of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, the following
recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
Email:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Enable and enforce MFA for all user accounts accessing
organizational email services. This significantly reduces the risk of
email account compromise.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive
Data Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Extend MFA requirements to all systems and applications that
handle or store sensitive organizational data. Prioritize systems based
on data classification and criticality.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create a comprehensive AUP that clearly outlines employee
responsibilities, permitted use of company IT resources, and
consequences for non-compliance.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all employees read, understand, and acknowledge the AUP,
ideally during onboarding and annually thereafter.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Mandate Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement mandatory security awareness training as part of the
onboarding process for all new hires. This should cover common threats,
organizational policies, and best practices.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct a Comprehensive External Network
Scan:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Although not part of this report due to data unavailability, it
is highly recommended to perform a thorough external network scan to
identify open ports, vulnerable services, and misconfigurations that
attackers could exploit.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Review and Update the Risk Register:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Establish or update an organizational risk register to formally
document, assess, and track all identified cybersecurity risks,
including those highlighted in this report.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The assessment of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>’s
cybersecurity posture, based primarily on the security control
questionnaire, reveals significant vulnerabilities in critical areas
such as MFA implementation and foundational security policies and
training. While the absence of network scan and pre-existing risk data
limits a comprehensive technical overview, the identified control gaps
are sufficient to indicate an elevated risk profile. Addressing these
core deficiencies through the recommended actions will substantially
improve the organization’s defensive capabilities against common cyber
threats. Ongoing vigilance, regular assessments, and continuous
improvement are essential for maintaining a strong security posture.</p>
