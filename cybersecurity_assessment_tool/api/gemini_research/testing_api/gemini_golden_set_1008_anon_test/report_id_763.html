<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a cybersecurity posture assessment for , based
on an organizational questionnaire, a limited network scan, and a review
of existing vulnerabilities. The assessment identifies critical gaps in
multi-factor authentication (MFA) for sensitive data systems and a
complete absence of security awareness training for employees. The
network scan revealed port 22 (commonly SSH) as open, but lacked crucial
service version information, preventing a deeper technical vulnerability
analysis. Addressing the identified risks, particularly regarding MFA
and security awareness training, is paramount to enhancing the
organization’s security posture and reducing its overall cyber risk.</p>

<h1 id="scope-and-methodology">Scope and Methodology</h1>
<p>This assessment was conducted using three primary data sources to
evaluate the current cybersecurity posture of :</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Organizational Security Questionnaire:</strong> A series
of questions designed to gauge the implementation of fundamental
security controls, policies, and employee awareness programs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Network Scan Data (Nmap):</strong> Analysis of network
scan results targeting to identify open ports and services, providing an
external view of the network’s attack surface.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Existing Vulnerability Data:</strong> Review of any
known, pre-existing vulnerabilities or risks within the organization’s
environment.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>It is important to note that the provided network scan data was
limited, lacking detailed service versions and product information. This
limitation constrained the ability to perform a comprehensive technical
vulnerability assessment on identified open ports.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="key-findings-from-questionnaire-analysis">Key
Findings from Questionnaire Analysis:</h2>
<p>The questionnaire analysis highlights critical gaps in the
organization’s security posture:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> MFA is not
required for access to sensitive data systems, leaving these critical
assets vulnerable to compromise via stolen or weak credentials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Security Awareness Training:</strong> There is a complete
absence of security awareness training for both new employees and
existing staff on an annual basis. This significantly increases the risk
of social engineering attacks, phishing, and human error leading to
security incidents.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An analysis of the provided network scan data for yielded the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target Scanned:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Used:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not available in provided

<li><p><strong>Detected Open Ports:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 22 (TCP):</strong> State <code>open</code>.
Service/Product/Version: Undetermined (Not available in provided
data).</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="implications-of-technical-scan">Implications
of Technical Scan:</h2>
<p>The presence of an open port 22 typically indicates an SSH (Secure
Shell) service. SSH is commonly used for secure remote administration.
However, without specific service version information (e.g., OpenSSH
version), it is not possible to assess potential vulnerabilities related
to outdated software or known exploits for the service running on this
port. This represents a blind spot and a potential unknown risk. Further
investigation is strongly recommended to identify the exact service, its
version, and its configuration.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the organizational questionnaire, technical
scan results, and current vulnerability data, the following risks have
been identified:</p>
<table>

<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data
Systems</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Without MFA, sensitive data systems are
vulnerable to credential theft, brute-force attacks, and unauthorized
access, significantly increasing the risk of data breaches and
compliance failures.</td>

<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Absence of New Employee Security
Training</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">New employees, without foundational
security awareness training, are more susceptible to social engineering
attacks (e.g., phishing) and may inadvertently introduce security risks
through poor practices.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Absence of Annual Security Awareness
Training</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Without regular, ongoing security
awareness training, employees’ knowledge of evolving threats diminishes,
leading to increased susceptibility to current attack vectors and
reduced compliance with security policies.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Undetermined Service Version on Port
22</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">An open port 22 with an undetermined
service version poses a blind spot. It could be running an outdated or
vulnerable SSH server, which an attacker could exploit to gain
unauthorized access.</td>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following recommendations are provided to address the identified
risks and enhance ’s cybersecurity posture:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong>
Mandate multi-factor authentication for all systems that process or
store sensitive organizational data. This significantly reduces the risk
of unauthorized access even if primary credentials are
compromised.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Comprehensive Security Awareness Training for
New Employees:</strong> Develop and implement a mandatory security
awareness training program for all new hires. This training should cover
essential topics such as phishing identification, strong password
practices, social engineering tactics, secure data handling, and
organizational security policies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Annual Security Awareness Training for All
Employees:</strong> Conduct regular (at least annual) security awareness
training for all employees. This will reinforce security best practices,
educate staff on emerging threats and attack vectors, and foster a
strong, security-conscious organizational culture.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Investigate Service on Port 22:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Perform an authenticated scan or an internal review to accurately
identify the exact service, product, and version running on port
22.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure the service is securely configured, adheres to the
principle of least privilege, and utilizes strong cryptographic
protocols.</p></li>
<li><p>Regularly patch and update the service to protect against known
vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p>If the service is not essential for business operations, consider
restricting access to it or disabling it.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Regular Vulnerability Assessments:</strong>
Implement a schedule for regular, in-depth vulnerability assessments
and, if appropriate, penetration testing across the IT infrastructure.
This proactive approach will help identify and remediate security
weaknesses before they can be exploited.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>This cybersecurity posture assessment highlights several critical
areas requiring immediate attention, particularly regarding foundational
security controls like multi-factor authentication for sensitive systems
and comprehensive security awareness training. While the technical scan
provided limited insight, it pointed to a need for deeper investigation
into the service running on port 22. By diligently addressing these
recommendations, can significantly mature its cybersecurity posture,
reduce its attack surface, and better protect its valuable assets from
evolving cyber threats. Continued vigilance and a proactive approach to
cybersecurity will be key to maintaining a resilient security
posture.</p>
