<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">1. Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details a cybersecurity posture assessment for
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, incorporating data from a network
scan, a security questionnaire, and pre-existing risk information. The
analysis reveals a minimal external technical attack surface from the
scanned target. However, significant internal security gaps were
identified through the questionnaire, particularly regarding the
consistent application of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer
access, the absence of an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), and critical
deficiencies in employee security awareness training. While a
pre-existing risk concerning an unencrypted web server on Port 80 was
noted, the recent scan indicates this port is currently closed on the
target, suggesting a potential resolution or outdated information.
Addressing the identified policy and training voids is paramount to
establishing a robust defense against common cyber threats.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">6. Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and significantly enhance
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>’s cybersecurity posture, the
following actionable recommendations are provided:</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="immediate-actions-criticalhigh-risks">6.1.
Immediate Actions (Critical/High Risks)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Logins:</strong> Immediately
enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all user logins to
computers and internal systems. This is a foundational control against
credential theft and unauthorized access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a comprehensive Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) that
clearly defines appropriate use of all organizational IT assets and
data. Ensure all employees formally review, understand, and acknowledge
adherence to this policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Mandatory Security Awareness Training for New
Hires:</strong> Integrate compulsory security awareness training into
the onboarding process for all new employees. This training should cover
phishing, social engineering, password hygiene, and data handling best
practices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Annual Security Awareness Training for All
Employees:</strong> Implement a program for mandatory annual (at least)
security awareness training for all staff. Training content should be
updated regularly to reflect current threat landscapes and reinforce
secure behaviors.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="further-investigation-and-long-term-strategies">6.2. Further
Investigation and Long-Term Strategies</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Validate Web Server Risk Status:</strong> Investigate the
"Unencrypted Web Server" risk from Input 3. If a web server is intended
to be public-facing, ensure it is configured with SSL/TLS (HTTPS) and
assess why the recent scan shows Port 80 closed. If the service is not
intended to be public, verify its continued inaccessibility.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Vulnerability Scanning:</strong> Establish a
schedule for regular internal and external vulnerability scans to
proactively identify newly exposed services, misconfigurations, and
software vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Comprehensive Policy Framework:</strong> Develop and
implement a full suite of cybersecurity policies and procedures,
including data classification, incident response, vendor risk
management, and backup/recovery strategies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Security Audits:</strong> Perform periodic internal and
external security audits and penetration tests to validate controls,
identify weaknesses, and ensure compliance with relevant
regulations.</p></li>
