<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A targeted network scan was performed on <code>[Target IP]</code>.
The scan aimed to identify open ports and services that could indicate
potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.</p>
<h2 id="scan-details">Scan Details</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target Host:</strong> <code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Used:</strong> nmap</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="identified-open-ports-and-services">Identified Open Ports and
Services</h2>
<p>The scan identified the following open ports:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 8080/tcp:</strong> Open</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Service/Product:</strong> Not identified by
scan.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Version:</strong> Not identified by scan.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>HTTP Title:</strong> (identified by
<code>http-title</code> script)</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: The Nmap scan reports an open port 8080 with a title
indicating potentially sensitive content. This finding will be
considered alongside existing risk assessments for correlation and
validation.</em></p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes findings from the security control review,
technical scans, and an existing risk register to provide a consolidated
view of identified risks.</p>
<h2 id="identified-gaps-from-security-control-review">Identified Gaps
from Security Control Review</h2>
<p>The following high-level risks were identified from the questionnaire
responses:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Email Access:</strong> Significantly
increases the risk of account compromise, leading to phishing, data
breaches, and impersonation. Email is a primary vector for cyberattacks,
and without MFA, a simple password compromise can have severe
consequences.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Without a formal AUP, employees may not understand their
responsibilities regarding company IT assets and data. This can lead to
misuse of resources, unauthorized data handling, compliance issues, and
an increased likelihood of security incidents due to unclarified user
behavior.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Infrequent Security Awareness Training:</strong> While
new employees receive training, annual or regular refresher training for
all employees is crucial. Cyber threats evolve rapidly, and infrequent
training leaves the workforce vulnerable to new social engineering
tactics, phishing campaigns, and malware distribution methods,
increasing human error as a attack vector.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="existing-risk-register-review">Existing Risk Register
Review</h2>
<p>The organization’s existing risk register was reviewed, identifying
the following:</p>
<div id="tab:existing_risks">
<table>
<caption>Existing Risks</caption>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align: left;"><strong>Risk Name</strong></th>
<th style="text-align: left;"><strong>Overview</strong></th>
<th style="text-align: left;"><strong>Severity</strong></th>

<td style="text-align: left;">Port 8080 is confirmed secure and false
positive.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">CVSS 0.0</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p><em>Note: The Nmap scan identified port 8080 as open with the HTTP
title . However, the existing risk register explicitly categorizes this
port as "Secured" and a "false positive" with a CVSS score of 0.0. This
discrepancy highlights a critical need for re-validation to ensure the
current assessment of this port’s security status is accurate and that
no unmitigated risks exist, especially given the potentially sensitive
title.</em></p>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following recommendations are provided to address the identified
risks and improve the overall cybersecurity posture. Recommendations are
prioritized based on their potential impact and foundational
importance.</p>
<h2 id="high-priority-recommendations">High Priority
Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement Mandatory MFA for Email Access:</strong>
Immediately mandate Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all
organizational email accounts. This foundational security control
significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised
credentials, phishing, or brute-force attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a comprehensive Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) that
clearly defines the proper use of all company IT resources, network
access, data handling procedures, and employee responsibilities
regarding cybersecurity. Ensure all employees formally acknowledge and
understand this policy upon hiring and annually thereafter.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Annual Security Awareness Training for All
Employees:</strong> Implement a mandatory annual security awareness
training program for all employees, not just new hires. This training
should cover current threat landscapes, social engineering techniques
(e.g., phishing, vishing), malware identification, secure password
practices, and data protection best practices.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="validation-and-review-recommendations">Validation and Review
Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Re-validate Port 8080 Security Status:</strong> Conduct
an immediate and thorough investigation into the open port 8080,
specifically focusing on the application displaying the title. Verify
the existing assessment that this port is "secured" and a "false
positive" against the live scan findings.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the port is indeed intentionally open and secured (e.g., by
strong access controls, network segmentation, or it’s an internal-only
interface), ensure comprehensive documentation of these mitigation
controls exists and is regularly reviewed.</p></li>
<li><p>If the port is found to be unsecure, misconfigured, or
inappropriately exposed, it must be secured or closed immediately to
prevent unauthorized access to potentially sensitive data.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>This assessment highlights several critical areas for improvement in
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>’s cybersecurity posture,
particularly concerning foundational controls like MFA for email, the
establishment of an acceptable use policy, and regular security
awareness training. Addressing these gaps, alongside the urgent
re-validation of existing risk assessments (specifically for port 8080),
will significantly enhance the organization’s resilience against
evolving cyber threats and improve its overall security maturity.</p>
