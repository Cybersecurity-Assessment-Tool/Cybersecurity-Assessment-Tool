<h2 id="analysis-of-questionnaire-gaps">Analysis of Questionnaire
Gaps</h2>
<p>The questionnaire results reveal critical security gaps in several
foundational areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Email and Computer Access:</strong> The
absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for both email access and
computer logins poses a severe risk. This makes accounts highly
susceptible to compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or
credential stuffing, potentially leading to unauthorized access to
critical systems and data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inadequate Security Awareness Training:</strong> The
organization currently lacks security awareness training for new
employees and does not conduct annual training for all staff. This
significantly elevates the risk of successful social engineering
attacks, phishing campaigns, and malware infections due to insufficient
employee knowledge and vigilance.</p></li>

<h2 id="technical-findings-analysis">Technical Findings Analysis</h2>
<p>The scan identified one significant open port:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 3389 (Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol -
RDP):</strong> The discovery of an open RDP port (3389) accessible from
the scanned network segment represents a critical security
vulnerability. RDP is a widely targeted service by adversaries
attempting to gain initial access, perform credential brute-forcing, or
exploit known vulnerabilities. While specific product and version
information was not available in the scan results, the mere exposure of
RDP is a high-risk finding, directly correlating with pre-existing risk
data for the organization.</p></li>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the comprehensive assessment, the following recommendations
are provided to address the identified risks and significantly enhance
the cybersecurity posture of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. These
actions are prioritized based on their potential impact and
criticality.</p>
<h2 id="immediate-actions-high-priority">Immediate Actions (High
Priority)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Access:</strong> Immediately
deploy and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication for all organizational
email accounts. This should be a mandatory requirement for all users
without exception.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Login:</strong> Implement and
enforce Multi-Factor Authentication for all user logins to company
computers, laptops, and endpoints, especially those accessing sensitive
data or systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Restrict RDP Exposure:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Immediately restrict public/external access to RDP (port 3389) at
the network perimeter.</p></li>
<li><p>Configure RDP to only be accessible from trusted internal
networks or exclusively via a securely configured Virtual Private
Network (VPN).</p></li>
<li><p>If remote RDP access is absolutely necessary, implement robust
network-level access controls (e.g., IP whitelisting, firewalls) and
ensure RDP is protected by strong, unique passwords, account lockout
policies, and Network Level Authentication (NLA). Consider using a
gateway or bastion host for centralized, secured access.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="strategic-actions-medium-priority">Strategic Actions (Medium
Priority)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Develop New Employee Security Awareness Training
Program:</strong> Create and implement a mandatory, comprehensive
security awareness training program for all new hires. This training
should cover essential topics such as phishing identification, strong
password practices, acceptable use policies, data handling, and incident
reporting procedures.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Annual Security Awareness Training for All
Employees:</strong> Establish and execute an annual, mandatory security
awareness training program for all employees. This training should be
refreshed regularly to address emerging threats, evolving organizational
policies, and current best practices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Review and Update Security Policies:</strong> Conduct a
thorough review and update of all existing security policies, including
the acceptable use policy. Ensure policies are clear, comprehensive,
effectively communicated, and regularly acknowledged by
employees.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The cybersecurity posture of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong> is
currently assessed as weak and requires immediate and substantial
improvement. The identified critical gaps in Multi-Factor Authentication
deployment, the absence of robust security awareness training, and the
confirmed exposure of RDP services collectively present a high degree of
risk to the organization’s information assets and operational
continuity. Addressing these fundamental security controls, as detailed
in the recommendations, is paramount to building a more resilient and
secure environment capable of defending against modern cyber threats.
Prioritizing and implementing these recommendations will significantly
reduce the attack surface and improve the overall security maturity of
the organization.</p>
