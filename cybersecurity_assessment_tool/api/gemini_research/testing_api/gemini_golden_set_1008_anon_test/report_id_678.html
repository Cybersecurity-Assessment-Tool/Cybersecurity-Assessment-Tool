<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>The security posture of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>
indicates several critical areas for improvement, particularly
concerning Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) implementation and
comprehensive security awareness training. While foundational policies
are in place, the recent technical scan found no open ports on the
target . This observation is notable as it contrasts with a pre-existing
risk of an unencrypted web server on Port 80 (CVSS 5.0), suggesting a
potential recent mitigation or an outdated risk assessment. However,
significant vulnerabilities persist due to the lack of MFA for computer
and sensitive data system access, coupled with the absence of initial
security awareness training for new employees. Addressing these gaps is
paramount to enhancing the overall security resilience of the
organization.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> The scan of did not identify any open ports
or active services. Specifically, port 80 was found to be closed,
indicating no active web server was reachable or listening on this
standard HTTP port during the scan. No other ports were found to be
open, and therefore no products or versions could be enumerated.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the comprehensive assessment, the following recommendations
are provided to enhance the cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. These actions are prioritized by
their potential impact on reducing overall organizational risk.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Universally:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Critical Priority:</strong> Immediately deploy and
enforce MFA for all access to sensitive data systems. This is the single
most impactful step to protect critical information assets.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>High Priority:</strong> Implement and mandate MFA for all
computer login mechanisms across the organization. This significantly
reduces the attack surface related to credential compromise.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Enhance Security Awareness Training Program:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>High Priority:</strong> Introduce mandatory security
awareness training for all new employees as part of their onboarding
process. This ensures foundational cybersecurity knowledge is
established from day one.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Continuous Improvement:</strong> Continue the annual
security awareness training for all employees, ensuring content is
updated regularly to reflect current threat landscapes.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Verify and Address Unencrypted Web Server
Risk:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Medium Priority:</strong> Conduct an internal
verification to confirm if the previously identified "Unencrypted Web
Server" risk has been fully and permanently mitigated. If Port 80 is
indeed closed and no longer hosting a web service, formally retire this
risk.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Proactive Measure:</strong> If there is any intention to
host web services in the future, ensure that all web servers are
configured to use HTTPS/SSL/TLS exclusively, redirecting all HTTP
traffic to HTTPS, to protect data in transit. Consider implementing a
Web Application Firewall (WAF) for enhanced protection.</p></li>
</ul></li>
