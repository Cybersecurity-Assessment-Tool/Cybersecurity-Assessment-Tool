<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on a security questionnaire,
a network scan, and existing risk data. The overall posture is assessed
as <strong>Poor</strong>, with several critical vulnerabilities and
significant control gaps identified. Key findings include the complete
lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across crucial systems (email,
computers, sensitive data), the absence of an acceptable use policy, and
the presence of a highly outdated FTP server (<code>vsftpd 2.3.4</code>)
configured to allow anonymous logins. These issues significantly elevate
the organization’s risk profile, making it highly susceptible to
unauthorized access, data breaches, and other cyberattacks. Immediate
action is required to address these critical findings.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-questionnaire-findings">Analysis
of Questionnaire Findings</h2>
<p>A significant concern is the complete lack of Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) implementation across email, computer logins, and
sensitive data systems. This represents a critical vulnerability, as
compromised credentials (e.g., via phishing) could grant attackers full
access without an additional authentication factor. The absence of an
employee acceptable use policy also introduces significant risk, as it
leaves employees without clear guidelines regarding appropriate
technology use and security responsibilities. While security awareness
training is conducted, its effectiveness may be limited without
foundational policies and controls like MFA.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was conducted on the specified target. The findings
reveal a critical vulnerability related to an exposed, outdated, and
misconfigured FTP service.</p>

<li><p><strong>Detail:</strong> This version of <code>vsftpd</code>,
released in 2011, is severely outdated and known to have critical
vulnerabilities. While the notorious backdoor (CVE-2011-2523) was
specific to malicious builds, <code>vsftpd 2.3.4</code> itself is
end-of-life and unsupported, meaning it lacks essential security patches
for numerous other flaws. Running such an ancient and unsupported FTP
server poses an extreme risk of exploitation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Script Output:</strong> – This is a critical
misconfiguration that allows anyone to connect to the FTP server without
credentials. This can lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or
even server compromise if write permissions are enabled, or through
directory traversal attacks.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of
Technical Findings</h2>
<p>The presence of an open FTP service running a critically outdated and
vulnerable version of <code>vsftpd</code> (2.3.4) is an immediate and
severe security concern. Compounding this, the server is configured to
allow anonymous logins, making it highly susceptible to exploitation. An
attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to files, upload
malicious content, or even leverage known vulnerabilities in this
ancient software to achieve remote code execution. This finding
represents a critical attack surface that must be addressed with
urgency.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Addressing the identified risks requires immediate and structured
intervention. The following recommendations are provided to improve
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>’s cybersecurity posture.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Universally:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Priority:</strong> Implement MFA for all email
accounts to significantly reduce the risk of phishing and credential
stuffing attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Short-Term Goal:</strong> Roll out MFA for all computer
logins, leveraging solutions like Windows Hello for Business or other
robust identity providers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Short-Term Goal:</strong> Mandate MFA for all access to
sensitive data systems, applications, and cloud services.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Decommission or Secure FTP Service:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Priority:</strong> Disable anonymous FTP login
functionality on the server immediately.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Priority:</strong> Evaluate the necessity of
the FTP service. If it is not business-critical, decommission the
service and close port 21.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Urgent Priority:</strong> If FTP functionality is
required, replace with a modern, supported, and securely configured file
transfer solution (e.g., SFTP, FTPS, or a managed file transfer service)
that uses strong encryption and authentication. Ensure any publicly
exposed services are running the latest patched versions.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Short-Term Goal:</strong> Draft and implement a
comprehensive AUP that clearly outlines employee responsibilities,
appropriate use of company assets, data handling, and security best
practices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ongoing Action:</strong> Integrate AUP review and
acknowledgment into new employee onboarding processes and annual
security awareness training.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade Outdated Operating Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Short-Term Goal:</strong> Prioritize a project to upgrade
all Windows 7 machines to a currently supported operating system (e.g.,
Windows 10 or 11) to ensure they receive critical security updates and
benefit from enhanced security features.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Long-Term Goal:</strong> Establish a robust hardware and
software lifecycle management plan to prevent future instances of
unsupported systems within the environment.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Continue and Enhance Security Awareness
Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Ongoing Action:</strong> Continue with existing security
awareness training programs for new and all employees annually.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ongoing Action:</strong> Incorporate specific modules
focused on recognizing phishing attempts, practicing safe browsing
habits, understanding social engineering tactics, and emphasizing the
critical importance of MFA.</p></li>
