<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides an assessment of the cybersecurity posture for
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The analysis, based on a security
questionnaire and a network scan targeting <code>[Target IP]</code>,
reveals several critical gaps. Specifically, the absence of Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for email access and inadequate security awareness
training for both new and existing employees represent high-severity
risks. The network scan did not yield any specific technical
vulnerabilities, as no active hosts or open ports were detected.
Addressing the identified high-severity risks related to human factors
and access controls is paramount to significantly improving the overall
security posture and reducing susceptibility to common attack
vectors.</p>

Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed targeting <code>[Target IP]</code>.</p>
<p>The scan did not report any active hosts or open ports on the
specified target. This could be due to several factors, including the
target being offline, protected by a robust firewall, or the IP address
being incorrect or unreachable from the scanning origin. Consequently,
no specific technical vulnerabilities related to exposed services or
outdated software versions could be identified from this scan data.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and improve the overall
cybersecurity posture, the following recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Mandatory MFA for Email Access</strong>: Deploy
and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all user accounts
accessing email. This is a critical control that significantly reduces
the risk of unauthorized access even if user passwords are compromised
through phishing or other means.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish New Employee Security Awareness
Training</strong>: Implement a comprehensive security awareness training
program for all new employees as a mandatory component of their
onboarding process. This training should cover essential topics such as
phishing identification, social engineering tactics, password best
practices, data handling policies, and incident reporting
procedures.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Annual Security Awareness Training for All
Employees</strong>: Conduct mandatory, recurring security awareness
training for all employees at least once per year. This ensures that
employees are continuously updated on evolving cyber threats, new
security policies, and reinforces best practices, maintaining a strong
human firewall against attacks.</p></li>
