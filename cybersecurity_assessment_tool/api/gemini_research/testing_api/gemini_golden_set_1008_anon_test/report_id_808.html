<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">1. Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for . The analysis is based on a review of organizational security
controls through a questionnaire, a technical network scan of , and a
review of reported existing vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Key findings indicate critical gaps in foundational security
controls, specifically regarding Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
email access and the lack of annual security awareness training for all
employees. While the external network scan showed no immediately
apparent open ports, these internal control deficiencies represent
significant risks to the organization’s security posture. No
pre-existing vulnerabilities were reported from the provided data.</p>
<p>Immediate recommendations include the implementation of MFA for all
email accounts and the establishment of a mandatory annual security
awareness training program for all personnel. Addressing these areas
will significantly enhance the organization’s resilience against common
cyber threats.</p>

Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was conducted on the specified target to identify open

<p>The Nmap scan against  reported no open ports. This indicates a
potentially well-hardened external perimeter or that no services were
found running on standard ports accessible from the scanner’s
perspective. All other ports were reported as closed.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">6. Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and enhance the overall
cybersecurity posture, the following recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email
Access:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Enable and enforce MFA for all organizational email accounts.
This significantly reduces the risk of account compromise due to stolen
or weak credentials.</p></li>
<li><p>Educate employees on the importance of MFA and provide clear
instructions for setup and usage.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Mandatory Annual Security Awareness
Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and implement a comprehensive security awareness training
program for all employees, conducted at least once per year.</p></li>
<li><p>Training should cover topics such as phishing, social
engineering, password hygiene, data handling, and incident
reporting.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider simulated phishing campaigns to test and reinforce
training effectiveness.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Regularly Review and Update Security
Policies:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ensure that the Acceptable Use Policy and other security policies
are regularly reviewed and updated to reflect current threats and best
practices.</p></li>
<li><p>Communicate policy updates clearly to all employees.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Regular Technical Vulnerability
Assessments:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Although the current scan showed no open ports, regular scans
(internal and external) are crucial to detect newly exposed services,
misconfigurations, or unpatched systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider authenticated vulnerability scans to identify weaknesses
within systems themselves, beyond just network accessibility.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">7. Conclusion</h1>
<p>The assessment reveals a proactive stance in some areas (e.g., MFA
for computers, new employee training, AUP) but highlights critical
foundational weaknesses in email MFA and continuous employee training.
Addressing these will significantly strengthen ’s defense against
prevalent cyber threats. Continuous monitoring and a proactive approach
to cybersecurity are essential for maintaining a robust security
posture.</p>
