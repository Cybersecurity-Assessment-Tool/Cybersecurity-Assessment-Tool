<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on an analysis of provided
organizational security control responses, network scan data, and
pre-existing risk information. The assessment reveals several critical
areas for improvement, primarily concerning foundational security
policies and training. While the network scan identified no immediately
exploitable open ports on the target, a pre-existing risk regarding an
unencrypted web server on port 80 was noted. The current scan, however,
indicates this specific port is closed, which mitigates immediate
exposure but highlights the importance of proactive security. Key
findings include a lack of an acceptable use policy and insufficient
security awareness training for new employees, alongside the need to
ensure robust protection against web-based vulnerabilities should
services on port 80 or similar ever become active. Addressing these gaps
is crucial for enhancing overall security resilience.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-security-control-gaps">Analysis
of Security Control Gaps:</h2>
<p>The questionnaire highlights two significant gaps in the
organization’s security posture:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong>
The absence of an AUP means there are no formal guidelines for employees
regarding the proper use of company assets, information, and networks.
This can lead to increased risks of data breaches, malware infections,
and legal liabilities, as employees may unknowingly or inadvertently
engage in insecure practices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Insufficient Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong> While annual training is conducted, the lack of
specific, mandatory training for new employees leaves them vulnerable to
common threats like phishing, social engineering, and malware from the
start of their employment, potentially before they understand
organizational security policies and best practices.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed to identify active hosts and open ports
on the specified target.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not available in provided scan
metadata.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Used:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Target Host Status:</strong> Up</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Identified Open Ports:</strong> None. Port 80 was found
to be <strong>closed</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="technical-analysis">Technical Analysis:</h2>
<p>The network scan of revealed that the host is online, but no open
ports were identified. Specifically, port 80 was reported as closed.
This indicates that currently, there are no directly exposed services on
the scanned IP address that could immediately be leveraged for
network-based attacks. The absence of open ports on the scanned target
is a positive finding for the immediate network perimeter security.</p>

technical scan, and pre-existing vulnerability data to present a

</div>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="correlation-and-impact">Correlation and
Impact:</h2>
<p>The "No" responses in the security questionnaire directly translate
into "High" severity risks due to their fundamental nature in
establishing a secure human and procedural layer. Without an AUP,
employees lack clear boundaries, increasing insider threat risks
(accidental or malicious) and potentially leading to non-compliance with
regulations. The absence of new employee training creates a critical
window of vulnerability, as new hires are often targeted by social
engineering attacks and may not be familiar with organizational security
policies.</p>
<p>The technical scan currently shows port 80 as closed, which is a
positive security posture regarding the "Unencrypted Web Server" risk
item from the pre-existing vulnerabilities. This indicates that while
the risk was previously identified, its immediate exposure has been
mitigated. However, the continued presence of this risk in the
organization’s register (even if currently addressed) suggests it was a
historical concern or could become one again. It is imperative to ensure
that if any web services are intended to be exposed externally in the
future, they must always utilize encryption (HTTPS/TLS) and be properly
configured to prevent recurrence of this risk.</p>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and enhance the overall
cybersecurity posture, the following actionable recommendations are
provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create a comprehensive AUP outlining clear guidelines for
acceptable use of IT assets, internet, email, data handling, and
prohibited activities.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all employees read, understand, and formally acknowledge
the AUP upon hiring and periodically thereafter (e.g.,
annually).</p></li>
<li><p>Integrate AUP review into employee onboarding and annual
refresher training to ensure continuous awareness.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Mandatory Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and implement a mandatory security awareness training
program specifically for new employees as part of the onboarding
process.</p></li>
<li><p>This training should cover fundamental topics such as phishing
identification, social engineering tactics, password best practices,
data handling, incident reporting procedures, and a review of the
organization’s AUP.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure completion of this training is tracked and
enforced.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Review and Address "Unencrypted Web Server" Risk (even if
currently mitigated):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Investigate the historical context of the "Unencrypted Web
Server" risk to understand its origin and confirm sustainable
remediation.</p></li>
<li><p>Establish clear policies and technical controls to ensure that if
port 80 (or any other port for web services) were to be opened in the
future, it is done so securely, requiring HTTPS/TLS encryption for all
web traffic.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement regular external and internal vulnerability scanning to
proactively identify and secure any inadvertently exposed or unencrypted
web services.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all publicly accessible services are part of a robust
patch management and configuration management program.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Continuous Monitoring and Improvement:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Establish a process for regular review and update of all security
policies and procedures (e.g., AUP, training modules) to adapt to
evolving threats.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct periodic internal and external vulnerability assessments
and penetration tests to identify potential weaknesses before they can
be exploited.</p></li>
<li><p>Maintain an up-to-date risk register, continuously monitor for
new threats, and regularly review and reassess identified risks to
ensure ongoing mitigation effectiveness.</p></li>
</ul></li>
