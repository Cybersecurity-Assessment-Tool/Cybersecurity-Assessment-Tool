<h1 id="introduction-and-executive-summary">Introduction and Executive
Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, synthesizing data from a
network scan, an organizational security questionnaire, and a review of
pre-existing risk information. The analysis reveals significant security
gaps and critical vulnerabilities that require immediate attention.</p>
<p>Key findings include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Critical MFA Gaps:</strong> The organization currently
lacks Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for critical services such as
email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, drastically
increasing the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised
credentials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Exposed Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP):</strong> A network
scan identified an open RDP port (3389) on <code>[Target IP]</code>.
This, combined with the absence of MFA, represents a severe entry point
for attackers, corroborated by a pre-existing "RDP Exposure" risk with a
CVSS score of 9.0 (Critical).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Security Awareness Training:</strong> There is no
established program for security awareness training for new or existing
employees, leaving the organization vulnerable to social engineering
attacks and human error.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, the current cybersecurity posture is evaluated as
<strong>Weak</strong>, primarily due to the foundational control
weaknesses identified. Immediate implementation of MFA, hardening of
exposed services, and initiation of security awareness training are
critical steps to mitigate these high-severity risks.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-questionnaire-results">Analysis
of Questionnaire Results</h2>
<p>The questionnaire highlights significant gaps in the organization’s
security posture, particularly concerning identity and access management
and security education:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA Deficiencies:</strong> The absence of MFA across
email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems is a critical
vulnerability. This makes the organization highly susceptible to
credential stuffing, brute-force attacks, and phishing campaigns, where
a single compromised password can lead to widespread unauthorized
access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Security Awareness Training:</strong> The
complete lack of security awareness training for employees, both new
hires and annually, means personnel are likely unprepared to identify
and resist common cyber threats such as phishing, social engineering,
and malware. This significantly increases the risk of human-factor
incidents.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Acceptable Use Policy:</strong> The presence of an
acceptable use policy is positive, indicating some foundational
documentation, but its effectiveness is limited without complementary
training and enforcement.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>

</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="technical-analysis">Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>The scan identified port 3389, commonly used for Remote Desktop
Protocol (RDP), as open on the target. RDP is a legitimate tool for
remote administration, but its exposure to the internet without proper
security controls is a well-known critical vulnerability. Threat actors
frequently target RDP for brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, and
exploiting known vulnerabilities to gain initial access to networks.</p>
<p>Considering the organization’s stated lack of MFA for computer logins
and sensitive systems, the open RDP port presents an extremely high-risk
entry point for adversaries.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="correlation-and-impact">Correlation and
Impact</h2>
<p>The correlation of findings reveals a mutually reinforcing set of
critical vulnerabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The open RDP port (technical finding) directly feeds into the
pre-existing "RDP Exposure" risk and is significantly exacerbated by the
absence of MFA for computer logins (questionnaire finding). An attacker
could brute-force RDP access, and without MFA, successful login would
grant immediate access.</p></li>
<li><p>The pervasive lack of MFA across all critical access points
(email, computers, sensitive data) indicates a fundamental weakness in
identity and access management. This makes the organization vulnerable
to common attack vectors, where compromised credentials, even for
low-privilege accounts, can lead to lateral movement and privilege
escalation.</p></li>
<li><p>The complete absence of security awareness training means
employees are likely unaware of these risks and how to protect against
them (e.g., identifying phishing emails that could lead to credential
compromise, which would then bypass the lack of MFA). This human factor
significantly amplifies all other technical and policy-based
risks.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These interconnected risks indicate a severely weakened security
posture, making the organization a high-value target for various cyber
threats, including ransomware, data breaches, and business email
compromise.</p>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified critical gaps and vulnerabilities, the
following recommendations are provided. These should be prioritized for
immediate implementation to significantly improve the organization’s
cybersecurity posture.</p>
<h2 id="immediate-actions">Immediate Actions</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Universally:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Immediately enable and enforce MFA for all email
accounts.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement MFA for all computer logins, especially for
administrative accounts and critical systems accessed via RDP.</p></li>
<li><p>Require MFA for access to all sensitive data systems.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Rationale:</em> MFA is a foundational security control that
dramatically reduces the risk of credential compromise leading to
unauthorized access.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Harden Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) Access:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Restrict Access:</strong> Close port 3389 at the
perimeter firewall. If RDP access is absolutely necessary from external
networks, restrict source IPs to known, trusted locations, or utilize a
Virtual Private Network (VPN) for all remote connections.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enable Network Level Authentication (NLA):</strong>
Require NLA for RDP connections.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Strong Password Policy:</strong> Enforce strong, complex
passwords for all accounts with RDP access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Account Lockout Policy:</strong> Implement robust account
lockout policies to thwart brute-force attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Audit Logs:</strong> Ensure RDP login attempts and
successes are logged and regularly reviewed.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Rationale:</em> Closing or severely restricting public RDP
access removes a critical attack surface that is actively exploited by
adversaries.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Initiate Basic Security Awareness Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and deploy mandatory basic security awareness training
for all new employees during onboarding.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement an initial, mandatory security awareness training
session for all current employees focusing on phishing, strong
passwords, and safe browsing habits.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Rationale:</em> Educating employees on common threats reduces
the likelihood of successful social engineering and human error-based
incidents.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="long-term-strategic-recommendations">Long-Term Strategic
Recommendations</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Develop a Comprehensive Security Policy
Framework:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Establish clear policies for password management, data handling,
incident response, remote access, and acceptable use.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Rationale:</em> A robust policy framework provides governance
and direction for all security initiatives.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Continuous Security Awareness
Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Establish a program for annual (or more frequent) security
awareness training for all employees, covering evolving
threats.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct simulated phishing exercises to gauge and improve
employee vigilance.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Rationale:</em> Continuous training keeps employees informed
and engaged with security best practices.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Vulnerability Management:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement a schedule for regular internal and external
vulnerability scanning.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider periodic penetration testing to identify exploitable
weaknesses proactively.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Rationale:</em> Proactive vulnerability management helps
identify and remediate weaknesses before they can be exploited by
attackers.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Test an Incident Response Plan:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create a detailed plan outlining steps to take before, during,
and after a cybersecurity incident.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct tabletop exercises to test the effectiveness of the plan
and train personnel.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Rationale:</em> A well-defined incident response plan
minimizes the impact and recovery time from a security breach.</p></li>
