<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the current cybersecurity posture of based on a
review of organizational security controls, a recent network scan, and
an assessment of pre-existing identified risks. The analysis reveals
several critical areas requiring immediate attention, primarily
concerning Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) implementation and
foundational security awareness training. While the recent network scan
of shows no immediately exploitable open ports (Port 80 was found
closed), certain previously identified risks, such as the "Unencrypted
Web Server," warrant re-evaluation given the latest scan findings.
Overall, exhibits a foundational understanding of security but requires
significant enhancements in technical controls and employee training to
mitigate high-impact risks effectively.</p>

<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The scan of indicates that Port 80
(typically used for unencrypted web traffic) is currently closed. This
is a positive finding as it reduces the attack surface for web-based
vulnerabilities at this specific port. No other open ports were
identified in the provided scan data.</p>

<h2 id="risk-correlation-and-impact">Risk Correlation and Impact</h2>
<p>The questionnaire results highlight significant gaps in fundamental
access control mechanisms (MFA) for internal systems and sensitive data.
These deficiencies pose a high risk of unauthorized access and data
breaches should employee credentials be compromised. The lack of
security awareness training for new employees further exacerbates this
risk by increasing the likelihood of successful phishing or social
engineering attacks that lead to credential compromise.</p>
<p>Regarding technical risks, the recent scan showing Port 80 as closed
is a positive indicator that a previously identified risk (PR-1,
Unencrypted Web Server) might have been addressed. However, it’s crucial
to confirm if this risk referred to the exact target scanned and if its
resolution is complete across all relevant assets. If the risk indeed
remains active for other systems, it would indicate an ongoing exposure
to unencrypted communication.</p>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are provided to
improve ’s cybersecurity posture. Recommendations are prioritized based
on their potential impact and severity.</p>
<h2 id="high-priority-recommendations">High-Priority
Recommendations</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer
Logins (Addressing QR-1):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Mandate MFA for all user logins to
company computers and endpoints.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Significantly reduces the risk of
unauthorized access even if passwords are stolen or guessed.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive
Data Systems (Addressing QR-2):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Enforce MFA for accessing all systems
containing sensitive or critical organizational data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Provides a crucial layer of defense for
the most valuable assets, protecting against insider threats and
external breaches.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="medium-priority-recommendations">Medium-Priority
Recommendations</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Establish Security Awareness Training for New Employees
(Addressing QR-3):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop and implement a mandatory
security awareness training program for all new employees during their
onboarding process.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Educates new hires on common threats
(e.g., phishing, social engineering) and safe computing practices from
the outset, reducing the human element of risk.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Verify and Re-evaluate "Unencrypted Web Server" Risk
(Addressing PR-1):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Investigate the "Unencrypted Web Server"
risk from Input 3. Confirm if it applies to the scanned target () or
another asset. If Port 80 is confirmed closed on the relevant system as
per the latest scan, formally retire or update this risk. If it pertains
to another service or IP, ensure appropriate encryption (e.g., SSL/TLS)
is implemented.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Ensures the risk register is accurate
and reflects the current state of security controls, preventing
misallocation of resources.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The cybersecurity posture of shows areas of strength, such as
existing MFA for email and an annual security awareness program for all
employees. However, critical vulnerabilities exist in the lack of MFA
for computer and sensitive data system access, and the absence of
initial security training for new employees. Addressing these
fundamental gaps should be the primary focus to build a more resilient
defense against common cyber threats. Continuous monitoring and regular
security assessments are vital to maintain and improve the
organization’s security posture over time.</p>
