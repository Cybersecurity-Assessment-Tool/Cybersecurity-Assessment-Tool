<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive assessment of the cybersecurity
posture for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, synthesizing data from
a recent network scan, responses to an organizational security
questionnaire, and pre-existing risk intelligence. The analysis reveals
critical vulnerabilities, primarily the lack of Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for sensitive data systems and the direct internet
exposure of Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) services. These findings
represent significant attack vectors that could lead to unauthorized
access, data breaches, and system compromise. While the organization
exhibits good practices in security awareness training and acceptable
use policies, these foundational gaps demand immediate attention.
Actionable recommendations are provided to mitigate identified risks and
significantly enhance the overall security posture.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Q3: Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> The
absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for systems containing sensitive
data represents a critical security gap. This significantly increases
the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches if credentials are
compromised through phishing, malware, or brute-force attacks.</p></li>

</ul>
<h2 id="technical-analysis">Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>The identification of an open RDP port (3389) directly accessible
from the internet is a severe finding. RDP is a widely targeted service
by cyber adversaries seeking initial access to organizational networks.
Without stringent security measures, such as VPN requirements, strong
password policies, account lockout, and Multi-Factor Authentication,
this exposure dramatically increases the risk of brute-force attacks,
credential stuffing, and potential exploitation of RDP vulnerabilities,
leading to unauthorized system access and lateral movement within the
network. This finding directly correlates with the pre-existing risk
data.</p>

<h2 id="detailed-risk-descriptions">Detailed Risk Descriptions</h2>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="risk-rdp-exposure">Risk: RDP Exposure</h3>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong> The network scan confirmed the direct
internet exposure of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) service on port
3389, aligning with a pre-existing vulnerability assessment. RDP is a
common entry point for attackers due to its widespread use and
historical vulnerabilities. Direct exposure without layered security
controls makes the organization highly susceptible to brute-force
credential attacks, ransomware deployment, and other forms of
unauthorized access. <strong>Severity:</strong> Critical (CVSS Score:
9.0) <strong>Affected Elements:</strong> , RDP server, potentially
connected internal network systems.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="risk-lack-of-mfa-for-sensitive-data-systems">Risk: Lack of MFA for
Sensitive Data Systems</h3>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong> Analysis of the security questionnaire
revealed that Multi-Factor Authentication is not required for accessing
systems that store or process sensitive data. This deficiency means that
a simple compromise of a username and password (e.g., via phishing)
would grant an attacker full access to high-value information, bypassing
a critical layer of defense. This significantly increases the risk of
data theft, regulatory non-compliance, and reputational damage.
<strong>Severity:</strong> High <strong>Affected Elements:</strong>
Sensitive data systems, user accounts accessing these systems,
organizational data.</p>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following recommendations are provided to address the identified
risks and enhance the overall cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. Immediate action is advised for
high-priority items.</p>
<h2 id="immediate-actions-high-priority">Immediate Actions (High
Priority)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive
Data Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mandate MFA for all user authentications to systems containing or
processing sensitive data. This is a fundamental security control that
significantly reduces the risk of successful credential-based
attacks.</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluate and implement appropriate MFA solutions (e.g., hardware
tokens, authenticator apps, biometrics) suitable for the organization’s
infrastructure.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Secure RDP Access (Port 3389):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Restrict Direct Internet Access:</strong> Wherever
possible, disable direct RDP access from the internet.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>VPN Gateway:</strong> Implement a secure Virtual Private
Network (VPN) solution as the sole entry point for remote RDP
connections. The VPN itself must be secured with MFA.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>IP Whitelisting:</strong> If direct internet RDP access
cannot be avoided, strictly limit source IP addresses that can connect
via firewall rules (i.e., allow only known, trusted IP ranges).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Strong Authentication:</strong> Enforce complex and
unique passwords for all RDP accounts. Implement strict account lockout
policies to deter brute-force attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Network Level Authentication (NLA):</strong> Ensure NLA
is enabled for all RDP connections to add a layer of authentication
before a full session is established.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Patching:</strong> Keep the operating system and
RDP service fully patched to mitigate known vulnerabilities.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="general-best-practices-ongoing">General Best Practices
(Ongoing)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Continuous Vulnerability Management:</strong> Implement a
continuous program for vulnerability scanning and penetration testing
across both internal and external assets to proactively identify and
remediate security weaknesses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Security Awareness Training Enhancement:</strong>
Continue and expand security awareness training, including specific
modules on phishing, social engineering, and the importance of MFA for
all employees.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Incident Response Planning and Testing:</strong> Develop,
document, and regularly test an incident response plan to ensure the
organization can effectively detect, respond to, and recover from
cybersecurity incidents.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Least Privilege Principle:</strong> Apply the principle
of least privilege to all user accounts and services, ensuring users
only have access to the resources absolutely necessary for their job
functions.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The cybersecurity assessment highlights critical areas requiring
immediate attention within <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>,
particularly regarding MFA for sensitive data systems and the internet
exposure of RDP. By diligently implementing the recommended actions, the
organization can significantly strengthen its security posture, reduce
its attack surface, and enhance its resilience against sophisticated
cyber threats. Continuous monitoring, proactive risk management, and
fostering a strong security culture will be paramount in maintaining a
robust defense in the dynamic threat landscape.</p>
