<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a cybersecurity posture assessment for
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on a review of
organizational security controls, technical scan results, and
pre-existing risk information.</p>
<p>The assessment identifies several strengths, particularly in the
consistent application of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across
email, computer login, and sensitive data systems. However, critical
gaps in policy and ongoing security awareness training have been
identified. Specifically, the absence of an employee acceptable use
policy and the lack of annual security awareness training for all
employees represent significant risks to the organization’s security
posture.</p>
<p>Technical scan results indicate a relatively secure external
footprint, with the primary finding being that port 80 (HTTP) is
currently reported as <code>closed</code>. This finding positively
contradicts an existing risk entry regarding an "Unencrypted Web Server"
on port 80. Further investigation is recommended to reconcile this
discrepancy, either confirming mitigation or identifying if the existing
risk refers to a different scope.</p>
<p>Overall, while technical exposure appears minimal based on the
provided scan data, the identified policy and training deficiencies
present a substantial internal risk that requires immediate attention.
Recommendations provided in this report aim to address these areas and
enhance the overall security posture.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-gaps">Analysis of Gaps</h2>
<p>Based on the questionnaire results, the following critical policy and
process gaps were identified:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong>
A fundamental policy defining the acceptable use of organizational IT
resources is missing. This can lead to misuse, data breaches, and
non-compliance with regulations, as employees lack clear guidelines on
responsible technology usage.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Annual Security Awareness Training for All
Employees:</strong> While new employees receive training, the absence of
recurring annual training for all staff means that security knowledge
can become stale, new threats may not be understood, and a consistent
security culture may fail to develop. Human error remains a leading
cause of security incidents, and ongoing training is crucial for
mitigation.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed to identify accessible services and
potential vulnerabilities from an external perspective.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Used:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Target(s):</strong> <code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not provided in metadata (Report
generation date: 2026-01-26)</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="nmap-scan-findings">Nmap Scan Findings</h2>
<p>The Nmap scan for the target <code>[Target IP]</code> indicated the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> Up</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Port 80 (HTTP):</strong> The scan explicitly reported
port 80 as <code>closed</code>. No services, products, or versions were
detected on this port due to its closed state.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>No other open ports or services were identified during this specific
scan. This suggests a minimal external attack surface based on the
provided scan data.</p>

<h2 id="risk-analysis-and-correlation">Risk Analysis and
Correlation</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Unencrypted Web Server (Port 80 is open):</strong> This
risk was identified in the pre-existing vulnerability data (Input 3).
However, the recent technical scan (Input 1) explicitly reports port 80
as <code>closed</code>. This discrepancy is significant. It suggests
that either the risk has been mitigated, the scan target was different
from the one for which the risk was initially assessed, or the risk
refers to an internal or historical state not covered by the current
external scan. It is recommended to verify the status and scope of this
particular risk.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy:</strong> This
is a critical policy gap identified through the security questionnaire.
Without an AUP, employees operate without clear boundaries for
acceptable use of company assets, increasing legal, compliance, and
security risks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Annual Security Awareness Training:</strong> This
process gap significantly elevates the risk of successful social
engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) and internal security incidents.
Consistent, up-to-date training is essential for maintaining a
security-conscious workforce.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the findings, the following recommendations are provided to
enhance the cybersecurity posture of <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="high-priority-recommendations">High-Priority
Recommendations</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Draft, review, and formally implement a
comprehensive AUP that clearly outlines expectations for employee
behavior regarding IT systems, data handling, internet usage, and device
policies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> An AUP provides a foundational
security control, clarifies responsibilities, and reduces risk from
accidental or malicious misuse of company resources.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Timeline:</strong> Immediate (within 1-2 months for
initial draft and implementation).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish and Execute Annual Security Awareness Training
for All Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop a program for mandatory annual
security awareness training for all employees, not just new hires. This
should cover current threats (e.g., phishing, ransomware), data
protection best practices, and the organization’s specific security
policies (including the new AUP).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> Ongoing training ensures
employees remain vigilant against evolving threats, reinforcing a strong
security culture and reducing the likelihood of human-error-induced
incidents.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Timeline:</strong> Immediate planning, with first annual
training conducted within 3-4 months.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="medium-priority-recommendations">Medium-Priority
Recommendations</h2>
<ol start="3">
<li><p><strong>Reconcile "Unencrypted Web Server" Risk vs. Scan
Results:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Investigate why the pre-existing risk of
"Unencrypted Web Server (Port 80 is open)" contradicts the recent scan
showing Port 80 as <code>closed</code>. Determine if the risk has been
mitigated, if it pertains to a different target or internal system, or
if the original assessment was inaccurate.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> Clarifying this discrepancy
ensures the risk register accurately reflects the current state of
assets and prevents allocation of resources to already mitigated issues,
or overlooking actual threats.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Timeline:</strong> Within 1 month.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="general-recommendations">General Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Regular Vulnerability Scanning:</strong> Implement a
schedule for regular external and internal vulnerability scans to
proactively identify and address potential weaknesses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Maintain a Comprehensive Risk Register:</strong> Ensure
the organization’s risk register is regularly updated with new findings,
mitigation statuses, and re-assessments.</p></li>
