<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong> based on a network scan, an
organizational security questionnaire review, and an assessment of
currently documented risks. Key findings indicate critical areas for
improvement, including outdated web server software, significant gaps in
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) implementation for sensitive data
systems, and a lack of fundamental security policies and new employee
training. Addressing these identified risks and implementing the
provided recommendations will significantly enhance the organization’s
overall security posture.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-questionnaire-gaps">Analysis of
Questionnaire Gaps</h2>
<p>The questionnaire responses indicate several critical gaps in
security controls:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> The absence of
MFA for sensitive data systems significantly increases the risk of
unauthorized access through compromised credentials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> A lack of
a formal AUP means employees may not be aware of expected behavior
regarding company assets and data, increasing legal and security
risks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>New Employee Security Awareness Training:</strong> New
hires represent a vulnerable point if not immediately educated on
security best practices, increasing the risk of social engineering
attacks or accidental data breaches.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on <code>[Target IP]</code> on
<code>2025-11-22T10:00:00Z</code>. The scan revealed the following open
ports and services:</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="host-target-ip-status-up">Host:
<code>[Target IP]</code> (Status: Up)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port:</strong> 443/TCP</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>State:</strong> Open</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Service:</strong> HTTPS</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Product:</strong> Nginx</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.18.0</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="technical-analysis">Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>The primary technical finding is the presence of an Nginx web server
running version <code>1.18.0</code> on port 443 (HTTPS). Nginx version
1.18.0 was released in April 2020 and reached its end-of-life (EOL)
status in 2021, meaning it no longer receives security updates or bug
fixes. Running an outdated and unsupported web server can expose the
organization to various known vulnerabilities, including remote code
execution, denial-of-service attacks, and information disclosure, for
which patches are available in newer versions. This significantly
elevates the risk of successful cyberattacks targeting the web
infrastructure.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis, the following risks have been identified:</p>

Vulnerabilities</h2>
<p>The provided data indicates no pre-existing vulnerabilities are
currently documented in the organization’s risk register.</p>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and improve the overall
cybersecurity posture of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, the
following recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade Nginx Web Server:</strong> Immediately plan and
execute an upgrade of the Nginx web server from version
<code>1.18.0</code> to the latest stable and supported version (e.g.,
Nginx 1.24.x or 1.26.x). Ensure thorough testing is performed before
deployment to production.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong>
Mandate and implement Multi-Factor Authentication for all systems that
handle or store sensitive organizational data. This should be a top
priority to protect against credential theft.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a comprehensive AUP that outlines acceptable and
unacceptable use of company IT resources, data, and internet access.
Ensure all employees acknowledge and understand this policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Introduce New Employee Security Awareness
Training:</strong> Establish a mandatory security awareness training
program for all new employees as part of their onboarding process. This
training should cover common threats (e.g., phishing, malware), data
handling procedures, and reporting security incidents.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Security Awareness Training:</strong> While
annual training is conducted for existing employees, consider increasing
the frequency or adding targeted micro-training sessions to reinforce
best practices and address emerging threats.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Vulnerability Scanning and Patch
Management:</strong> Implement a consistent schedule for vulnerability
scanning of all external and internal systems. Establish a robust patch
management program to ensure all software and operating systems are kept
up-to-date.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Review and Update Security Policies:</strong> Regularly
review and update all security policies and procedures (including the
new AUP) to reflect the evolving threat landscape and organizational
changes.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>While some foundational security controls are in place (e.g., MFA for
email and computer login, annual training for existing staff),
significant vulnerabilities and control gaps were identified during this
assessment. Proactive steps to address the outdated Nginx server,
implement MFA more broadly, and establish fundamental policies and
training for new employees are crucial. By acting on these
recommendations, <strong>[Organization Name]</strong> can substantially
reduce its attack surface and bolster its defenses against potential
cyber threats.</p>
