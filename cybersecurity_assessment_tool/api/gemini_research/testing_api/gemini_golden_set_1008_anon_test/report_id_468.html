<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report presents a cybersecurity posture assessment for
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, analyzing available organizational
security data, security control questionnaire responses, and attempting
to integrate technical scan data and existing risk information. The
assessment revealed critical gaps in multi-factor authentication (MFA)
implementation for both email access and computer logins, posing
significant risks to organizational data integrity and confidentiality.
While some foundational security policies and awareness training are in
place, the absence of MFA in these key areas severely weakens the
overall security posture. Furthermore, it is important to note that
crucial technical network scan data and details regarding existing
organizational vulnerabilities were unavailable or malformed at the time
of this assessment, limiting a comprehensive technical risk evaluation.
Recommendations focus on immediate MFA deployment and the provision of
complete data for a more thorough analysis.</p>

<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of MFA for Email Access</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The absence of Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) for email access makes user accounts highly susceptible to
phishing, credential stuffing, and brute-force attacks. Compromised
email accounts can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data
exfiltration, and further internal network breaches.</td>

<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of MFA for Computer Login</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Without MFA for logging into internal
computers, unauthorized access is significantly easier if primary
credentials are stolen or guessed. This can lead to lateral movement
within the network, unauthorized data access, and potential ransomware
deployment.</td>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">4. Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified gaps and enhance the overall cybersecurity
posture, the following recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Access Immediately:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Deploy MFA for all user accounts accessing organizational email.
Prioritize solutions that are user-friendly but robust (e.g.,
authenticator apps, FIDO2 security keys).</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct immediate awareness campaigns to educate users on the
importance and process of MFA.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Login:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Integrate MFA for all computer logins, especially for
administrative accounts and machines with access to sensitive data.
Consider solutions compatible with existing directory services (e.g.,
Active Directory, Azure AD).</p></li>
<li><p>Explore single sign-on (SSO) solutions that enforce MFA across
multiple systems for a streamlined yet secure user experience.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Provide Complete and Valid Data for
Re-assessment:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ensure future network scan data is provided in a valid, parsable
format to allow for a comprehensive technical vulnerability
assessment.</p></li>
<li><p>Supply accurate and complete details of existing organizational
vulnerabilities and risk registers for a more thorough risk correlation
and management analysis.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Maintain and Enhance Security Awareness
Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Continue with annual security awareness training for all
employees and specific training for new hires.</p></li>
<li><p>Incorporate real-world examples of phishing and social
engineering attacks, emphasizing the role of MFA in mitigating these
threats.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>These recommendations are crucial steps towards mitigating immediate
high-priority risks and establishing a more robust security foundation.
A follow-up assessment is advised once the recommended MFA controls are
implemented and comprehensive technical and existing risk data becomes
available.</p>
