<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details a cybersecurity assessment derived from network
scan data, organizational security questionnaire responses, and a review
of current risks. The analysis reveals several critical security gaps
and areas requiring immediate attention, specifically regarding the
absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for key systems, the lack
of a fundamental security policy, and the operation of outdated
software. Addressing these findings is paramount to bolstering the
organization’s overall security posture and mitigating potential cyber
threats.</p>

<p><strong>Identified Control Gaps:</strong> Based on the questionnaire,

<ul>
<li><p>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for email
access.</p></li>
<li><p>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for accessing

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was conducted on the target on November 22, 2025 at
10:00:00 UTC. The scan identified one active host with an open port and
associated services.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="host-status">Host Status</h2>
<p>The target host was found to be <strong>UP</strong>.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="open-ports-and-services">Open Ports and
Services</h2>
<p>The following open ports and services were identified:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 443 (HTTPS)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>State</strong>: Open</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Service Name</strong>: https</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Product</strong>: nginx</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Version</strong>: 1.18.0</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Technical Findings:</strong> The Nginx web server detected on
port 443 is running version 1.18.0. This version is significantly
outdated. Nginx 1.18.x was an old stable release line, and numerous
security patches, bug fixes, and performance improvements have been
incorporated into newer stable versions (e.g., 1.24.x, 1.26.x).
Operating outdated software like this increases the attack surface by
potentially exposing the system to known vulnerabilities that have been
resolved in later versions.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the security questionnaire responses and the
technical scan findings, the following risks have been identified. No
pre-existing vulnerabilities were provided in the initial input
data.</p>

</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
for Email</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is not a
mandatory requirement for accessing organizational email accounts,
significantly elevating the risk of unauthorized access through
credential theft or brute-force attacks.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">High</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
for Sensitive Data Systems</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is not
enforced for access to systems containing or processing sensitive
organizational data. This oversight leaves these critical systems
vulnerable to unauthorized access, data exfiltration, and potential
breaches if primary credentials are compromised.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">High</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Absence of Employee Acceptable Use
Policy</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The organization currently operates
without a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). This lack of a
clear policy framework can lead to inconsistent employee behavior,
increased risk of security incidents (e.g., misuse of company assets,
unauthorized software installation), and potential compliance or legal
liabilities.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Medium</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Outdated Nginx Web Server Software</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The Nginx web server running on port 443
is version 1.18.0. This version is outdated and likely contains known
vulnerabilities for which patches are available in newer stable
releases. Continued use of this outdated software exposes the system to
exploitation, potentially leading to denial of service, data compromise,
or full system control.</td>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actionable recommendations are provided to address the
identified risks and enhance the overall cybersecurity posture of the
organization.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Access</strong>: Mandate the
immediate implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all
organizational email accounts. This should include all users and access
methods (webmail, desktop clients, mobile apps).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems</strong>: Extend
the mandatory requirement for Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to all
systems and applications that store, process, or provide access to
sensitive organizational data. Conduct a thorough audit to identify all
such systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce an Acceptable Use Policy</strong>:
Prioritize the development and formal implementation of a comprehensive
Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). Ensure all employees receive
mandatory training on the AUP, understand its implications, and formally
acknowledge their compliance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Update Nginx Web Server Software</strong>: Plan and
execute an upgrade of the Nginx web server running on port 443 to the
latest stable version (e.g., Nginx 1.26.x or newer). Establish a regular
patching schedule for all server software to ensure timely application
of security updates and mitigation of known vulnerabilities.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>This cybersecurity assessment has identified several critical
vulnerabilities and control gaps that pose significant risks to the
organization. By diligently implementing the recommended actions,
particularly concerning MFA adoption, policy enforcement, and software
updates, the organization can substantially strengthen its defenses,
reduce its attack surface, and enhance its resilience against evolving
cyber threats. A proactive and continuous approach to security
management remains crucial for safeguarding digital assets in today’s
dynamic threat landscape.</p>
