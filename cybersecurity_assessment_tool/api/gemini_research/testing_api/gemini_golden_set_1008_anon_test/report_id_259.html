<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This cybersecurity posture assessment for <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong> identifies several areas requiring immediate attention.
The organization currently lacks crucial security controls, specifically
regarding Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins, an
explicit Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), and consistent annual
security awareness training for all employees. These represent
significant attack vectors and policy deficiencies. Technically, a
network scan revealed port 22 (commonly SSH) as open on the target
system. While not inherently a vulnerability, an open port is an exposed
service that requires vigilant monitoring and secure configuration. No
pre-existing vulnerabilities were provided in the input data. Addressing
the identified policy and technical gaps through the provided
recommendations will significantly improve the organization’s defensive
capabilities against common cyber threats.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-questionnaire-results">Analysis
of Questionnaire Results</h2>
<p>The questionnaire highlights three critical areas where security
controls are either absent or insufficient:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA for Computer Logins (Question 2):</strong> The
absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for computer logins significantly
increases the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials
(e.g., phishing, brute-force attacks).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Employee Acceptable Use Policy (Question 4):</strong>
Lacking a formal AUP means employees may not be fully aware of their
responsibilities regarding company IT assets and data, potentially
leading to misuse or accidental data breaches.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Annual Security Awareness Training (Question 6):</strong>
While new employees receive training, the lack of annual refreshers for
all employees means that knowledge may become outdated, and new threats
or policies may not be effectively communicated, increasing
susceptibility to social engineering and other attacks.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed using Nmap. The target IP was not
specified in the scan data, and crucial service and version information
for the identified open port was unavailable, limiting a more in-depth
vulnerability assessment.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Used:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not available</p></li>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="identified-open-ports">Identified Open
Ports</h2>
<p>The scan identified the following open ports:</p>

</div>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of
Technical Findings</h2>
<p>Port 22, commonly associated with the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol,
was found to be open. SSH is a critical service often used for remote
administration and secure file transfer. Without specific service and
version information from the scan, it is not possible to assess whether
the service running on this port is outdated or has known
vulnerabilities. However, any open port represents an attack surface.
Proper configuration, strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., key-based
authentication, disabled root login), and regular patching are essential
for services exposed over the network.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified security gaps and enhance the overall
cybersecurity posture of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, the
following actionable recommendations are provided:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Logins:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Mandate Multi-Factor Authentication for
all computer and workstation logins across the organization. This should
apply to both local and network-based authentications.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Significantly reduces the risk of
unauthorized access stemming from stolen or phished credentials, serving
as a critical layer of defense.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> Critical</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Create a comprehensive AUP outlining
acceptable use of company IT resources, data handling procedures, and
security expectations. Distribute it to all employees, ensure mandatory
reading, and require formal acknowledgment of understanding and
compliance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Establishes clear boundaries for IT
asset usage, reduces the likelihood of misuse or accidental data
breaches, and fosters a culture of security awareness and
accountability.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> High</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Annual Security Awareness Training for All
Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Extend security awareness training to
all employees at least annually. This training should cover current
cyber threats (e.g., phishing, ransomware, business email compromise),
organizational policies, and best practices for data protection and
incident reporting.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Keeps employees informed and vigilant
against evolving cyber threats, transforming them into a strong
defensive line against social engineering and other attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> High</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Secure Open Port 22 (SSH):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Identify Service:</strong> Determine the exact service
and version running on port 22.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Harden Configuration:</strong> Ensure the service is
securely configured by:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Disabling root login directly via SSH.</p></li>
<li><p>Enforcing strong, key-based authentication instead of passwords
where possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Restricting access via firewall rules to only trusted IP
addresses or networks.</p></li>
<li><p>Implementing an intrusion detection/prevention system (IDS/IPS)
to monitor for malicious activity.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Patch Regularly:</strong> Keep the service and underlying
operating system fully patched to their latest stable versions to
mitigate known vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Minimize Exposure:</strong> If the service is not
strictly required to be externally accessible, consider closing the port
or severely limiting its exposure.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Minimizes the attack surface, protects
against potential exploits targeting SSH or other services on this port,
and reduces the risk of unauthorized remote access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> Medium</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The current cybersecurity posture of <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong> demonstrates significant policy and control deficiencies,
particularly concerning MFA implementation for computers, the absence of
an Acceptable Use Policy, and insufficient annual security awareness
training. While the technical scan was limited in scope and detail, the
presence of an open port 22 warrants immediate investigation and
hardening. Adopting the recommended actions will substantially
strengthen the organization’s defense mechanisms against common cyber
threats and improve its overall security resilience. Continued
vigilance, regular assessments, and a proactive security strategy are
essential for maintaining a robust security posture in the evolving
threat landscape.</p>
