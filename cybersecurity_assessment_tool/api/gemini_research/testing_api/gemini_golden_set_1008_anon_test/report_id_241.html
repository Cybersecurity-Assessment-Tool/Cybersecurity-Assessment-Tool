<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This document presents a comprehensive assessment of the current
cybersecurity posture for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The
evaluation is based on a structured analysis of three primary data
sources: a targeted network scan, an organizational security
questionnaire, and a review of existing reported risks. The overarching
objective is to identify existing vulnerabilities, highlight critical
security gaps, and provide actionable recommendations designed to
enhance the overall security posture and reduce the organization’s
exposure to cyber threats.</p>

<h2 id="key-observations-from-questionnaire">Key Observations from
Questionnaire</h2>
<p>The analysis of the questionnaire responses reveals several
significant deficiencies in critical security areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong>
MFA is currently not required for accessing email, logging into
computers, or accessing sensitive data systems. This constitutes a
critical vulnerability, as it leaves user accounts and critical
organizational assets highly susceptible to credential-based attacks
(e.g., phishing, brute-force, password reuse), which can lead to
widespread unauthorized access and data breaches.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong>
The organization currently lacks a formal Employee Acceptable Use
Policy. Without clear guidelines defining the appropriate use of company
IT assets, networks, and data, employees may inadvertently or
intentionally engage in activities that increase security risks, lead to
data leakage, and create compliance challenges.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Positive Security Awareness Training:</strong> On a
positive note, the organization demonstrates a commitment to security
awareness by conducting training for both new hires and all employees at
least once per year. This is a foundational element for fostering a
security-conscious culture.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A targeted network scan was performed on on . The scan aimed to
identify open ports and services, along with their respective versions,
to uncover potential technical vulnerabilities. The following findings
were identified:</p>

</div>
<h2 id="key-observations-from-technical-scan">Key Observations from
Technical Scan</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Outdated Nginx Web Server:</strong> The scan identified a
web server running on port 443, utilizing Nginx version 1.18.0. This
version was released in April 2020. As of late 2025, this version is
significantly outdated. Running outdated software is a substantial
security risk, as it often contains known vulnerabilities that have been
publicly disclosed and for which exploits may exist. Continuing to
operate an older version of Nginx could expose the web server and any
hosted applications to various security threats, including remote code
execution, denial of service attacks, and information disclosure,
depending on the specific Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs)
affecting this particular version.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the combined analysis of the organizational security
questionnaire, the technical network scan, and the review of existing
reported risks, the following key risks have been identified:</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To effectively address the identified risks and significantly enhance
the cybersecurity posture of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, the
following actionable recommendations are provided, categorized by
priority:</p>
<h2 id="immediate-actions-critical-risks">Immediate Actions (Critical
Risks)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Across All
Critical Access Points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Email Access:</strong> Immediately deploy and enforce MFA
for all organizational email accounts. This should be the highest
priority due to email’s critical role in business operations and its
status as a primary target for cyberattacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Computer Login:</strong> Mandate MFA for all employee
computer logins, especially for devices that access corporate networks,
sensitive data, or critical applications.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> Implement and strictly
enforce MFA for accessing all systems that store, process, or transmit
sensitive organizational or client data.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade Nginx Web Server:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Plan and execute an urgent upgrade of the Nginx web server from
version 1.18.0 to the latest stable release (e.g., Nginx 1.24.x or
1.26.x series).</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct thorough testing in a non-production (staging)
environment to ensure compatibility and stability before deploying the
upgrade to production systems to prevent service disruption.</p></li>
<li><p>Establish a process for regularly monitoring Nginx security
advisories and maintaining an evergreen update strategy.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="strategic-enhancements-high-risks">Strategic Enhancements (High
Risks)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Draft a comprehensive AUP that clearly defines the acceptable and
unacceptable use of company-owned IT assets, networks, internet access,
and data.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all employees read, understand, and formally acknowledge
the AUP upon hiring and periodically thereafter (e.g.,
annually).</p></li>
<li><p>Integrate the AUP review and adherence into the existing annual
security awareness training program.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="continuous-improvement">Continuous Improvement</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Regular Security Audits and Assessments:</strong>
Implement a program for conducting periodic internal and external
vulnerability assessments and penetration tests. This proactive approach
will help identify and address new weaknesses before they can be
exploited.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Robust Patch Management Program:</strong> Establish and
enforce a comprehensive patch management program for all software
applications, operating systems, and network infrastructure devices to
ensure timely application of security updates and patches.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Incident Response Plan Development and Testing:</strong>
Develop, document, and regularly test a detailed incident response plan.
This plan should clearly define roles, responsibilities, procedures, and
communication strategies to ensure the organization can effectively
detect, respond to, mitigate, and recover from security
incidents.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
