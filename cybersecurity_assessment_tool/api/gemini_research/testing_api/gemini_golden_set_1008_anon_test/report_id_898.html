<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The assessment was
based on provided organizational data, a security questionnaire, and
available network scan results.</p>
<p>Key findings indicate several critical gaps in security controls,
particularly concerning multi-factor authentication for sensitive data
systems, the absence of an employee acceptable use policy, and a lack of
dedicated security awareness training for new employees. No network scan
data or pre-existing vulnerabilities were provided for technical
analysis.</p>
<p>Immediate recommendations focus on addressing these identified policy
and training deficiencies to significantly enhance the overall security
posture and reduce organizational risk.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">5. Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the assessment findings, the following recommendations are
provided to enhance the organization’s cybersecurity posture.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="immediate-actions-high-priority">5.1.
Immediate Actions (High Priority)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong>
Mandate and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all access to
systems storing or processing sensitive organizational data. This
critical control significantly reduces the risk of credential compromise
leading to data breaches.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create and formally implement a comprehensive Employee
Acceptable Use Policy. Ensure all employees acknowledge and understand
this policy, outlining proper conduct when using company IT resources.
Regular reviews and updates are also essential to keep the policy
current.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Introduce New Employee Security Awareness
Training:</strong> Establish a mandatory security awareness training
program for all new employees during their onboarding process. This
training should cover common threats (e.g., phishing, malware), company
security policies, and incident reporting procedures to build a
resilient human firewall.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="general-recommendations">5.2. General
Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Regular Network Scans:</strong> Implement a
schedule for regular internal and external network vulnerability
scanning. This proactive measure will help identify open ports,
misconfigured services, and outdated software versions that could be
exploited by malicious actors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Provide Complete Data for Assessments:</strong> Ensure
comprehensive and accurate organizational data, including detailed
network scan results and existing vulnerability lists, are provided for
future cybersecurity assessments. This will enable a more thorough and
effective analysis, leading to more precise recommendations.</p></li>
