<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment conducted for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The
assessment involved a review of organizational security controls via a
questionnaire, a targeted network scan of <code>[Target IP]</code>, and
an analysis of pre-existing risk data.</p>
<p>Overall, the organization’s current cybersecurity posture is assessed
as <strong>Critical</strong>. Significant vulnerabilities and critical
gaps in fundamental security controls were identified across multiple
domains. Key findings include a pervasive lack of Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA), an outdated and insecure File Transfer Protocol
(FTP) service allowing anonymous access, and the continued use of
unsupported operating systems (Windows 7). These deficiencies create a
high-risk environment, making the organization highly susceptible to
various cyber threats, including unauthorized access, data breaches, and
system compromise.</p>
<p>Urgent implementation of the provided recommendations is imperative
to mitigate these critical risks and establish a foundational level of
security.</p>

Review: Questionnaire Analysis</h1>
<p>A review of the provided security questionnaire responses reveals
critical gaps in foundational security controls and policies. The lack
of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across several critical access
points, coupled with the absence of essential security policies and
training, indicates a significant organizational vulnerability to common
cyber threats.</p>

Observations from Questionnaire:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Critical MFA Gaps (Email):</strong> MFA is not required
for email access, significantly increasing the risk of unauthorized
access via compromised credentials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Critical MFA Gaps (Computer Login):</strong> MFA is not
required for computer logins, making workstations highly vulnerable to

</ul>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-port-21-finding">Analysis of Port
21 Finding:</h3>
<p>The presence of an open FTP service running ‘vsftpd 2.3.4‘ is highly
concerning for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>End-of-Life (EOL) Software:</strong> vsftpd 2.3.4 was
released in 2011 and is considered end-of-life. It has known severe
vulnerabilities, including a backdoor (CVE-2011-2523) that allows
arbitrary command execution.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Anonymous Access Enabled:</strong> The ‘ftp-anon‘ Nmap
script confirmed that anonymous login is permitted. This means any
attacker can connect to the FTP server without credentials, potentially
listing, downloading, or even uploading files (depending on server
configuration). This can lead to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Data exposure (if sensitive files are present).</p></li>
<li><p>Uploading malicious content (e.g., web shells, malware).</p></li>
<li><p>Using the server as a distribution point for illegal content,
leading to legal and reputational damage.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Cleartext Communication:</strong> FTP transmits
credentials and data in cleartext, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping
and interception attacks if not secured with TLS/SSL (FTPS) or replaced
with SFTP.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This finding represents a <strong>Critical Risk</strong> due to the
ease of exploitation, potential for remote code execution, and immediate
data exposure.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified critical risks and improve the overall
cybersecurity posture of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, the
following recommendations are provided. These should be prioritized and
implemented as a matter of urgency.</p>
<h2 id="multi-factor-authentication-mfa-implementation">Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) Implementation</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for all services:</strong> Mandate and
enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email, logging
into computers, and accessing all sensitive data systems. This is the
single most effective control against credential-based attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Choose robust MFA solutions:</strong> Select MFA
solutions that are resilient against common bypass techniques (e.g.,
avoid SMS-based MFA where stronger alternatives exist).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="policy-and-training-enhancement">Policy and Training
Enhancement</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong>
Create and formally implement a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use
Policy (AUP). Ensure all employees acknowledge and adhere to
it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mandatory Security Awareness Training for New
Hires:</strong> Implement immediate and mandatory security awareness
training for all new employees as part of their onboarding
process.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enhance Annual Security Training:</strong> Review and
update the annual security awareness training to cover current threat
landscapes and reinforce best practices.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="technical-security-controls">Technical Security Controls</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>FTP Service Remediation (Critical):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Disable or Remove Anonymous Access:</strong> Immediately
disable anonymous login capabilities on the FTP server.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade or Replace FTP Service:</strong> Due to its
end-of-life status and critical vulnerabilities, the ‘vsftpd 2.3.4‘
service should be immediately upgraded to a current, supported version
or, preferably, replaced with a more secure file transfer protocol like
SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) or FTPS (FTP over TLS/SSL) if secure
file transfer is still required.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Firewall Restrictions:</strong> Restrict access to port
21 (and 20 for data) to only trusted internal networks or specific IP
addresses, if external access is absolutely necessary.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Operating System Upgrades:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade Windows 7 Systems:</strong> Plan and execute a
phased upgrade of all workstations running Windows 7 to a currently
supported operating system (e.g., Windows 10 or 11). Prioritize systems
with access to sensitive data.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ongoing-security-practices">Ongoing Security Practices</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Regular Vulnerability Scanning &amp; Patch
Management:</strong> Implement a routine vulnerability scanning program
and robust patch management process for all systems and
applications.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Security Hardening:</strong> Apply security hardening
baselines to all servers and workstations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Incident Response Plan:</strong> Develop or refine an
Incident Response Plan to effectively detect, respond to, and recover
from security incidents.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The assessment highlights a pressing need for significant
improvements in <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>’s cybersecurity
posture. By prioritizing and implementing the outlined recommendations,
the organization can substantially reduce its attack surface, mitigate
critical risks, and build a more resilient defense against evolving
cyber threats. Continuous vigilance and a commitment to security best
practices are essential for long-term protection.</p>
