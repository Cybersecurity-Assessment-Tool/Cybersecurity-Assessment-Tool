<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings from a cybersecurity posture
assessment conducted for Neon Pulse Entertainment. The assessment
leveraged an internal network scan, responses to an organizational
security questionnaire, and a review of pre-existing
vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Key findings indicate several critical security gaps that require
immediate attention. The organizational questionnaire revealed
significant deficiencies in Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
implementation for email and computer logins, and a concerning lack of
initial security awareness training for new employees. From a technical
perspective, an internal host <code>10.0.0.15</code> was discovered
running an extremely outdated and critically vulnerable FTP service
(<code>vsftpd 2.3.4</code>) which also permits anonymous login. This
combination poses an severe risk of full system compromise and data
breach. Additionally, the organization has an identified risk of
outdated Windows 7 systems still in use.</p>
<p>The cumulative risk level is high, necessitating prompt and robust
corrective actions to mitigate these significant threats and
substantially improve the overall security posture of Neon Pulse
Entertainment.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="critical-gaps-identified-from-questionnaire">Critical Gaps
Identified from Questionnaire:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Email Access:</strong> Not requiring
Multi-Factor Authentication for email access significantly elevates the
risk of account compromise through various attacks (e.g., phishing,
credential stuffing), potentially leading to broader system breaches and
data exposure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Computer Login:</strong> Similar to
email, the absence of MFA for computer logins leaves endpoints
vulnerable to unauthorized access if user credentials are stolen,
guessed, or compromised.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong> New employees are often prime targets for social
engineering attacks due to their potential unfamiliarity with
organizational security policies, common threat vectors, and internal
procedures. The absence of initial, mandatory training creates a
critical human-factor vulnerability.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An internal network scan was conducted on the host
<code>10.0.0.15</code>. The scan identified critical vulnerabilities
that require immediate attention.</p>

<p>The following open port and service were identified on the target
host:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port:</strong> 21/TCP</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>State:</strong> Open</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Service Name:</strong> FTP (<code>ftp</code>)</p></li>

<code>vsftpd 2.3.4</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Details:</strong> Nmap detected "Anonymous FTP login
allowed".</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="technical-findings-analysis">Technical Findings Analysis</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Critically Outdated FTP Server (vsftpd 2.3.4):</strong>
This version of vsftpd was released in 2011 and is considered extremely
outdated and unmaintained. It is notoriously known for a critical
backdoor vulnerability (CVE-2011-2523) that allows an unauthenticated
attacker to execute arbitrary commands as the root user. This presents
an extreme and easily exploitable risk of full system
compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Anonymous FTP Access Allowed:</strong> The configuration
allowing anonymous FTP login, especially on an easily accessible
internal server, is a severe security misconfiguration. This enables
unauthorized users to access, upload, or download files without any
authentication, potentially leading to data leakage, unauthorized data
injection, or further system compromise if combined with other
vulnerabilities.</p></li>

Descriptions</h2>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="lack-of-multi-factor-authentication-mfa">Lack
of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not enforce MFA
for email access or for computer logins. This dramatically increases the
attack surface for credential-based attacks (e.g., phishing,
brute-force, password reuse), making it significantly easier for
attackers to gain unauthorized access to accounts and internal
systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> High risk of account compromise,
unauthorized access to corporate resources, data breaches, and potential
lateral movement within the network.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="no-security-awareness-training-for-new-employees">No Security
Awareness Training for New Employees</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Overview:</strong> New hires are particularly susceptible
to social engineering attacks as they may not be fully aware of company
security policies, common phishing tactics, or appropriate data handling
procedures. The absence of initial, mandatory security awareness
training leaves a critical human-factor vulnerability that can be
exploited by attackers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Increased susceptibility to phishing,
malware infection, social engineering, and accidental insider threats
leading to data exposure or system compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="critical-vsftpd-server-vulnerabilities-outdated-version-anonymous-access">Critical
vsftpd Server Vulnerabilities (Outdated Version &amp; Anonymous
Access)</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Overview:</strong> The internal host
<code>10.0.0.15</code> is running <code>vsftpd 2.3.4</code>, a version
released over a decade ago with a critical, well-known backdoor
vulnerability (CVE-2011-2523). Compounding this, the server is
configured to permit anonymous FTP access. This combination allows
unauthenticated users to execute arbitrary commands as root and
access/modify files, leading to immediate and complete system
compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Complete system compromise, remote code
execution, establishment of persistent access, data exfiltration, data
integrity loss, and potential use as a pivot point for further internal
attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Severity:</strong> Critical</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="outdated-windows-policy-windows-7">Outdated
Windows Policy (Windows 7)</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multiple workstations within the
organization are still operating on Windows 7. This operating system
reached its End-of-Life (EoL) in January 2020. As such, these systems no
longer receive critical security updates, making them highly vulnerable
to known and newly discovered exploits for which no patches will be
released.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Increased risk of malware infection,
system compromise, inability to comply with modern security standards,
and potential non-compliance with regulatory requirements.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Severity:</strong> Medium</p></li>
