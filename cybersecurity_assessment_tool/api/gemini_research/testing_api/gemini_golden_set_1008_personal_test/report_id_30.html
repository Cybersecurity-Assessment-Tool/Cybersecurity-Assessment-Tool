<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">1. Executive Summary</h1>
<p>The assessment reveals a mixed security posture for Gilded Cage
Design. While a recent network scan of an internal host found no open
ports, indicating a potentially hardened internal system or strict
firewalling, several significant gaps in organizational security
controls were identified through the questionnaire. Critically, the lack
of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across email, computer login, and
sensitive data systems poses a high risk of unauthorized access due to
credential compromise. Additionally, the absence of security awareness
training for new employees creates a foundational vulnerability. A
previous risk entry concerning an "Unencrypted Web Server" on Port 80
exists, which contradicts the current scan results; this discrepancy
requires immediate investigation. Recommendations focus on addressing
these policy and control weaknesses to build a more robust defense.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">4. Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>An Nmap scan was performed on the target internal host .</p>
<p>The scan revealed no open ports on the target. Specifically, port 80
was found to be <code>closed</code>. This indicates a potentially
well-hardened internal system or effective firewalling.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="discrepancy-note">Discrepancy Note</h2>
<p>It is important to note a discrepancy between this current scan and
pre-existing risk information. A previous assessment (detailed in
Section 5) indicates an "Unencrypted Web Server" risk due to "Port 80
being open." The current scan explicitly found Port 80 to be
<code>closed</code>. This difference could be attributed to changes in
network configuration, the target’s role (internal vs. external), or an
outdated risk entry. Verification of the current configuration and
services running on is highly recommended to reconcile this
information.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">6. Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the assessment, the following recommendations are provided
to improve Gilded Cage Design’s cybersecurity posture.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="immediate-actions">6.1. Immediate
Actions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong>
Urgently implement MFA for all access points, including email systems,
computer logins, and any sensitive data applications. This is the single
most impactful immediate action to prevent credential theft.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Initiate New Employee Security Awareness
Training:</strong> Establish mandatory security awareness training for
all new hires before they gain access to company systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Verify Port 80 Status and Risk Register:</strong>
Investigate the discrepancy regarding Port 80 on . Confirm if the port
is truly closed or if the internal scan missed an active service. Update
the risk register accordingly based on current findings. If a web server
is active on another port, ensure it uses HTTPS/SSL/TLS for
encryption.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="long-term-strategies">6.2. Long-Term
Strategies</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Regular Security Policy Review and Updates:</strong>
Periodically review and update the employee acceptable use policy and
other security policies to ensure they remain relevant and
effective.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Periodic Vulnerability Assessments:</strong> Conduct
regular internal and external vulnerability scans and penetration tests
to proactively identify and remediate security weaknesses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enhanced Security Awareness Program:</strong> Expand the
existing annual security awareness training to cover advanced threats
and specific organizational risks. Consider simulated phishing
campaigns.</p></li>
