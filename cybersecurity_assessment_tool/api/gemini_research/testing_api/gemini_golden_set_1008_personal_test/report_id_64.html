<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed on the target IP address on
2026-01-26.</p>
<h2 id="summary-of-findings">Summary of Findings</h2>
<p>The Nmap scan against the specified target identified no open ports.
This indicates that the external perimeter for this specific IP address
is currently well-secured against common port-scanning techniques.
However, it is important to note that this scan is a snapshot and does
not cover internal network vulnerabilities, web application
vulnerabilities, or other potential attack vectors. Further
comprehensive internal assessments are recommended.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of security control gaps and technical
findings, the following risks have been identified. No pre-existing
vulnerabilities were reported in the provided data.</p>

lack of understanding of organizational policies.</td>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and strengthen the overall
cybersecurity posture of <strong>Falcon Heavy</strong>, the following
recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for All
Computer Logins:</strong> Deploy MFA solutions for all user accounts
accessing organizational computers and systems. This significantly
reduces the risk of unauthorized access even if passwords are
compromised.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive
Data Systems:</strong> Prioritize the implementation of MFA for all
systems that store or process sensitive organizational or customer data.
This adds a critical layer of security to the most valuable
assets.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a clear and comprehensive AUP that outlines the
expected behavior and responsibilities of employees regarding the use of
company IT resources. Ensure all employees read, understand, and
acknowledge this policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Mandatory Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong> Implement a mandatory security awareness training
program for all new hires during their onboarding process. This should
cover common threats, organizational policies, and best
practices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Regular Vulnerability Assessments and Penetration
Testing:</strong> While the external scan showed no open ports, regular,
thorough vulnerability assessments and penetration tests (internal and
external) are crucial to identify and address potential weaknesses
across all systems and applications.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Review and Update Security Awareness Training
Annually:</strong> Ensure that the existing annual security awareness
training is current, relevant, and engaging. Consider more frequent,
targeted training modules for specific risks or roles.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p><strong>Falcon Heavy</strong> demonstrates a proactive approach to
some security controls, such as annual security awareness training and
MFA for email. However, critical vulnerabilities exist in core areas
like MFA deployment for internal systems and sensitive data, as well as
fundamental governance policies. Addressing these gaps through the
provided recommendations will significantly enhance the organization’s
resilience against cyber threats. Continuous monitoring, regular
assessments, and ongoing employee education are vital for maintaining a
strong and adaptive security posture.</p>
