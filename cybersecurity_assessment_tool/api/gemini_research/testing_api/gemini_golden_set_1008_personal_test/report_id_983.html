<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This document presents the findings of a cybersecurity assessment
conducted for Oasis Wellness. The assessment involved a multi-faceted
approach, integrating organizational self-reported data regarding
security controls, results from a targeted technical scan, and an
analysis of pre-existing known vulnerabilities. The objective is to
offer a holistic view of the current security landscape, identify areas
of concern, and provide strategic recommendations for improvement to
bolster the organization’s defense mechanisms.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following information was gathered from the client to establish a
foundational understanding of their operational context. Placeholders
are used where specific data was not provided in the input.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed targeting the local loopback interface
(‘127.0.0.1‘). The scan results provide insights into open ports and
services that may represent potential entry points or
misconfigurations.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Target:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> 2026-01-27</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Port 22 (SSH):</strong> State: Open</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Observation: While scanning ‘127.0.0.1‘ (localhost) primarily
reveals internal service configurations, its exposure and the services
running on it can be critical. If ‘127.0.0.1‘ represents a critical
system component or if there are mechanisms (e.g., port forwarding,
proxies) that make it indirectly accessible, then an open SSH port
presents a potential vector for unauthorized access, especially if
default or weak credentials are in use.</em></p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section consolidates risks identified from the security control
review (questionnaire), technical scan results, and pre-existing known

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and enhance the overall
cybersecurity posture of Oasis Wellness, the following actionable
recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
Email:</strong> Mandate and enforce MFA for all organizational email
accounts. This is a critical step to significantly reduce the risk of
email account compromise, which is a common initial vector for
cyberattacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive
Data Systems:</strong> Extend MFA requirements to all systems that
store, process, or transmit sensitive organizational data. This adds a
crucial layer of security to protect the most valuable assets.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a comprehensive AUP outlining the appropriate and
inappropriate use of company IT resources, data, and internet access.
Ensure all employees acknowledge, understand, and adhere to this policy
annually.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Annual Security Awareness Training:</strong>
Implement a mandatory, engaging, and up-to-date annual cybersecurity
awareness training program for all employees. Training should cover
current threats (e.g., phishing), secure computing practices, data
handling best practices, and AUP compliance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Review and Secure Localhost Exposure and SSH
Service:</strong> Conduct an immediate investigation into the ‘Localhost
Exposed‘ risk and the open SSH service on . If the service is not
required, disable it. If required, ensure it is configured with strong
security measures, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Disabling root login directly via SSH.</p></li>
<li><p>Enforcing key-based authentication over password-based
authentication.</p></li>
<li><p>Restricting access to specific IP addresses or user
groups.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensuring the SSH server and client software are regularly patched
and up-to-date.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Regular Vulnerability Assessments and Penetration
Tests:</strong> Implement a schedule for regular internal and external
vulnerability scanning and penetration testing. This proactive approach
helps to continuously identify and address security weaknesses across
the IT infrastructure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Test an Incident Response Plan:</strong>
Create a formal incident response plan that outlines procedures for
detecting, responding to, containing, eradicating, recovering from, and
learning from cybersecurity incidents. Regularly test this plan through
tabletop exercises to ensure effectiveness.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Oasis Wellness demonstrates some foundational security practices,
such as MFA for computer logins and initial employee security training.
However, significant gaps exist, particularly concerning MFA adoption
for critical systems (email, sensitive data), formal policy enforcement
(AUP), and ongoing employee training. The technical scan, combined with
pre-existing risks, highlights specific configuration weaknesses that
require immediate attention. Addressing these areas through the provided
recommendations will substantially strengthen the organization’s
defenses against current and emerging cyber threats, fostering a more
robust and resilient cybersecurity posture.</p>
