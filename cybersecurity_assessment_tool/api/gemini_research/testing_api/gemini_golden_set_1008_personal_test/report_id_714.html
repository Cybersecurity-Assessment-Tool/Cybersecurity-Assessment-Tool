<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive assessment of the current
cybersecurity posture for Iron River Finance, based on recent network
scan data, organizational security questionnaire responses, and
pre-existing known risks. The organization demonstrates commendable
adherence to Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across critical systems,
which is a significant strength. However, the assessment identified
critical gaps in foundational security controls, specifically the
absence of an employee acceptable use policy and a lack of consistent
annual security awareness training for all employees. The recent network
scan on <code>192.168.0.5</code> revealed no open ports, indicating a
robust perimeter for this specific asset from an external perspective.
Despite this, a pre-existing organizational risk concerning an
unencrypted web server was noted, highlighting an area requiring
validation and potential remediation. Addressing the identified policy
and training deficiencies is crucial for enhancing the overall security
resilience of Iron River Finance.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>A recent network scan was conducted on the target system
<code>192.168.0.5</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> 2026-01-27</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Target IP:</strong> <code>192.168.0.5</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Findings:</strong> The scan of target
<code>192.168.0.5</code> revealed that all probed ports were found in a
<em>closed</em> state. Specifically, port 80, often associated with
unencrypted web services, was identified as closed. This indicates a
strong security posture for this specific host regarding direct network
accessibility, as no immediately exposed services were detected by this
scan.</p></li>

<p>This section consolidates the identified security gaps, technical
findings, and pre-existing organizational risks.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="identified-gaps-from-questionnaire">Identified Gaps from
Questionnaire</h2>
<p>Based on the security control review, the following critical gaps
were identified:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong>
(ID 4) The absence of an AUP leaves the organization vulnerable to
employee misuse of company resources, legal liabilities, and unclear
expectations regarding acceptable online behavior. This is a
foundational policy for good cybersecurity governance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inadequate Annual Security Awareness Training:</strong>
(ID 6) While new employees receive training, the lack of annual security
awareness training for all employees increases the risk of successful
phishing attacks, social engineering, and other human-factor
vulnerabilities. Continuous education is vital to maintain vigilance
against evolving threats.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="technical-vulnerabilities">Technical
Vulnerabilities</h2>
<p>The network scan of <code>192.168.0.5</code> did not reveal any open
ports or immediately exploitable services. This is a positive finding,
suggesting a well-hardened network perimeter for the scanned target.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="pre-existing-known-risks">Pre-existing Known
Risks</h2>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To strengthen the overall cybersecurity posture of Iron River
Finance, the following recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement a Comprehensive Acceptable Use
Policy (AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create a clear, concise, and comprehensive AUP that outlines
acceptable and unacceptable use of company information systems,
networks, and data.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all employees read, understand, and formally acknowledge
the AUP, ideally on an annual basis or upon any significant
updates.</p></li>
<li><p>Integrate AUP review and acknowledgment into the new employee
onboarding process.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Mandatory Annual Security Awareness Training
for All Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement a mandatory annual security awareness training program
for all employees, not just new hires.</p></li>
<li><p>The training should cover current threats such as phishing,
social engineering, ransomware, password hygiene, secure data handling
practices, and incident reporting procedures.</p></li>
<li><p>Track employee completion rates and conduct periodic assessments
(e.g., simulated phishing campaigns) to measure the effectiveness of the
training.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Validate and Remediate "Unencrypted Web Server"
Risk:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Investigate the "Unencrypted Web Server" risk to identify the
specific asset(s) it refers to.</p></li>
<li><p>If any web server is found to be operating on port 80 without
encryption:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the service is not essential, close port 80 and disable the
service.</p></li>
<li><p>If the service is essential, migrate it to HTTPS (port 443) using
valid SSL/TLS certificates and enforce HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport
Security). Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If the risk referred to <code>192.168.0.5</code> and port 80 is
indeed closed, update the organizational risk register to reflect the
remediation status.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Regular Vulnerability Scanning and Penetration
Testing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Conduct regular internal and external vulnerability scans to
identify new exposures, misconfigurations, or unpatched
systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Periodically engage in professional penetration testing to
simulate real-world attacks and uncover complex vulnerabilities that
automated scans might miss.</p></li>
</ul></li>
