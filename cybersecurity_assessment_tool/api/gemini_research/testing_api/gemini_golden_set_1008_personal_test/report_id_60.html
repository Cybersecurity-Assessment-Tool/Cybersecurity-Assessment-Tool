<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides an assessment of <strong>Binary Star</strong>’s
cybersecurity posture based primarily on self-reported organizational
data and a security control questionnaire. Due to malformed or
incomplete input data, comprehensive network scan results and
pre-existing risk information were unavailable for this assessment.</p>
<p>The primary findings highlight critical gaps in Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) enforcement for sensitive data systems and a lack
of dedicated security awareness training for new employees. While
<strong>Binary Star</strong> shows strengths in general MFA adoption and
annual security awareness training, these specific deficiencies present
significant risks. The absence of technical scan data and pre-existing
risk registers also represents an unknown exposure that warrants
immediate attention. Addressing these identified areas and obtaining
comprehensive technical data is crucial for improving the overall
security posture and reducing the attack surface.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and enhance <strong>Binary
Star</strong>’s cybersecurity posture, the following recommendations are
provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong>
Immediately deploy and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all
systems and applications that contain or provide access to sensitive
data. This measure adds a crucial layer of security, significantly
reducing the risk of unauthorized access even if primary credentials are
stolen.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mandatory Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong> Establish a mandatory and comprehensive security
awareness training program for all new hires. This training should be
completed before new employees gain access to company systems and data,
covering topics such as phishing, social engineering, password hygiene,
data handling policies, and incident reporting procedures.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Comprehensive Technical Vulnerability
Scans:</strong> Perform regular (e.g., quarterly) external and internal
vulnerability scans, followed by professional penetration testing, to
identify and remediate technical weaknesses in network infrastructure,
applications, and systems. Implement a patching and vulnerability
management program to ensure discovered vulnerabilities are addressed
promptly.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Maintain a Centralized Risk
Register:</strong> Establish a formal process for identifying,
assessing, and documenting cybersecurity risks. Develop and maintain a
comprehensive risk register that includes all identified
vulnerabilities, potential threats, their potential impact, likelihood,
and current mitigation strategies. This will provide a clear overview of
the organization’s risk landscape.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h1>
<p>This report is based on the data provided at the time of assessment.
Cybersecurity is an evolving field, and continuous monitoring,
adaptation, and improvement of security controls are essential. The
absence of specific data inputs (due to malformed JSON) may limit the
scope and completeness of this assessment. This report should not be
considered an exhaustive list of all possible vulnerabilities or
risks.</p>
