<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This cybersecurity posture assessment for <strong>True North
Travel</strong> highlights key areas of strength and weakness based on
current data. While a recent network scan on an internal host did not
reveal actively open vulnerable services, a detailed review of
organizational security practices identified significant policy and
training deficiencies. Specifically, the absence of Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for computer logins, lack of an Acceptable Use
Policy (AUP), and insufficient security awareness training for employees
pose substantial human-factor and procedural risks. A previously
documented risk regarding an unencrypted web server on Port 80 was found
to be mitigated based on the current scan, but it underscores the
importance of continuous monitoring. Addressing the identified policy
and training gaps, alongside a robust MFA rollout, is critical for
strengthening the organization’s defense against common cyber threats
and improving overall cyber hygiene.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on a specified target to identify open
ports, active services, and potential technical vulnerabilities.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong> (Note: This is a private IP
address. The scan appears to have been conducted on an internal network
segment or a specific host, not the organization’s public-facing
external IP address ).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> [Scan Date] (Not provided in input
data)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Used:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The scan completed successfully.</p></li>
<li><p>No open ports were detected on the scanned target .</p></li>
<li><p>Specifically, Port 80 (HTTP) was found to be
<code>closed</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>No active services, products, or versions were identified as
running or exposed externally on this specific target during this
scan.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The scan on did not reveal any
immediate technical vulnerabilities through open ports or exposed
services. This suggests a relatively secure posture for this specific
internal host at the time of the scan. Further scans on other internal
segments and the organization’s external IP address () are recommended
for a comprehensive external and internal vulnerability
assessment.</p></li>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actionable recommendations are provided to address the
identified risks and significantly enhance the overall cybersecurity
posture of <strong>True North Travel</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Logins (Addressing
RA-001):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Deploy and rigorously enforce
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all user logins to company
computers, internal network access, and critical internal
systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> This fundamental control drastically
reduces the risk of unauthorized access, even if user passwords are
stolen or weak.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)
(Addressing RA-002):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Create a clear, comprehensive, and
legally reviewed AUP that outlines employee responsibilities for using
company IT resources, data handling, internet usage, and communication.
Distribute it to all employees and obtain signed acknowledgments
annually.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Establishes clear behavioral
guidelines, reduces misuse of company resources, minimizes accidental
data leaks, and strengthens legal defensibility in case of policy
violations.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Comprehensive Security Awareness Training
Programs (Addressing RA-003, RA-004):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action (New Hires):</strong> Implement mandatory security
awareness training as an integral part of the onboarding process for all
new employees, focusing on initial threat vectors like phishing and
social engineering.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action (Annual &amp; Ongoing):</strong> Conduct
mandatory, regular (at least annual) security awareness training for all
employees. This training should cover the latest threat landscapes,
phishing detection, data protection best practices, incident reporting
procedures, and organizational policies. Consider quarterly refreshers
or simulated phishing campaigns.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Transforms employees into an active
defense layer by equipping them with the knowledge and skills to
recognize and avoid common cyber threats, thereby significantly reducing
human-factor risks.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Verify and Continuously Monitor Web Server Status
(Addressing RA-005):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Conduct an inventory of all existing and
historical web servers. For any potentially active web servers
(especially on the external IP ), confirm they are either properly shut
down or, if active, are configured exclusively with HTTPS (SSL/TLS
encryption) and adhere to modern security hardening standards.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Prevents the exposure of sensitive data
over unencrypted channels, ensures compliance with privacy regulations,
and aligns web services with current security best practices. Implement
automated external port scanning to ensure no services are inadvertently
exposed.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Regular Vulnerability Management and
Monitoring:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Establish a schedule for regular
internal and external vulnerability scans, penetration testing, and
security audits across the entire IT infrastructure, including the
external IP address .</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Provides ongoing, proactive visibility
into the security posture, identifies new weaknesses as they emerge, and
ensures the effectiveness of implemented security controls against
evolving threats.</p></li>
</ul></li>
