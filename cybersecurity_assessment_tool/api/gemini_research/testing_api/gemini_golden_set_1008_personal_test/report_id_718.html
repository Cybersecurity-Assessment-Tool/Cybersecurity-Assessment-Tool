<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This cybersecurity posture assessment was conducted for <strong>Echo
Chamber Arts</strong> to evaluate its current security controls and
identify potential risks. The assessment leveraged data from a detailed
security questionnaire, an external network scan, and a review of
pre-existing organizational risks.</p>
<p><strong>Strengths Identified:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is implemented for accessing
email.</p></li>
<li><p>MFA is required for accessing sensitive data systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Annual security awareness training is provided to all
employees.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Findings and Critical Gaps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>No MFA for Computer Logins:</strong> A critical control
gap exists as MFA is not required for logging into computers,
significantly increasing the risk of unauthorized access through
compromised credentials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> The
organization lacks a formal AUP, which is essential for defining
employee responsibilities and expected behavior regarding company assets
and data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of New Employee Security Awareness
Training:</strong> New hires do not receive security awareness training,
leaving them potentially vulnerable to common threats from the start of
their employment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Network Scan Results:</strong> The external network scan
targeting <code>[Target IP]</code> did not identify any open ports,
which is a positive indicator for external perimeter security, though it
does not provide insight into internal network posture.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Pre-existing Risks Identified:</strong> No active
vulnerabilities or risks were reported through the provided
data.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Addressing these critical gaps is paramount for bolstering the
organization’s cybersecurity defenses and mitigating potential
threats.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was conducted against the target IP address
<code>[Target IP]</code>. The scan was performed on <code>N/A</code> as
no specific scan date was provided due to the empty scan results.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="summary-of-findings">Summary of Findings</h2>
<p>The provided network scan data was empty, indicating that no open
ports or services were identified on the target host
<code>[Target IP]</code> based on this specific scan. This suggests a
potentially secure external network perimeter. However, it is crucial to
note that an empty scan result does not provide information about
internal network security, potential vulnerabilities on accessible
services (if any were present but not detected), or host-based security
configurations. Further, a more comprehensive scan with authentication
or deeper probes might reveal additional details.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To enhance the cybersecurity posture of Echo Chamber Arts, the
following recommendations are proposed, prioritized by severity and
impact:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer
Logins:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediately deploy and enforce MFA for
all user logins to company computers, laptops, and internal
systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Significantly reduces the risk of
unauthorized access, even if primary credentials are stolen, by
requiring a second verification factor.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Create a comprehensive Acceptable Use
Policy that clearly defines employee responsibilities, permitted and
prohibited activities on company IT assets, and security
guidelines.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Establishes clear expectations for
employee behavior, reduces the likelihood of policy violations leading
to security incidents, and provides a basis for disciplinary action if
policies are breached. Ensure all employees acknowledge and sign the
AUP.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Integrate mandatory cybersecurity
awareness training into the onboarding process for all new hires. This
training should cover topics such as phishing, password hygiene, social
engineering, data handling, and reporting security incidents.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Ensures that all employees, from their
first day, have a foundational understanding of cybersecurity best
practices and organizational security policies, thus reducing
human-factor vulnerabilities.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Internal Network Assessment:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Although the external scan was clear,
consider conducting an internal vulnerability assessment and penetration
test to identify weaknesses within the internal network and
systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Provides a complete picture of the
security posture, covering potential insider threats or compromised
internal systems that external scans cannot detect.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>These recommendations, when implemented, will significantly
strengthen Echo Chamber Arts’s defenses against common cyber threats and
improve its overall security resilience.</p>
