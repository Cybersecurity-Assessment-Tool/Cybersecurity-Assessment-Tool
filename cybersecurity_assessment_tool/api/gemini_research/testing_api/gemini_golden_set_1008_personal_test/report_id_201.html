<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a cybersecurity posture assessment for Orchid
Isle, based on a security questionnaire, a network scan, and a review of
existing risk data. The organization demonstrates good practices in some
areas, such as requiring Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer
logins and sensitive data access, and providing initial security
awareness training.</p>
<p>However, critical gaps have been identified:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Lack of MFA for email access, leaving a primary communication
vector vulnerable to compromise.</p></li>
<li><p>Absence of a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), which
is foundational for defining expected employee conduct regarding IT
resources.</p></li>
<li><p>Insufficient annual security awareness training for all
employees, diminishing the effectiveness of the "human firewall" against
evolving threats.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Most critically, the network scan revealed an open port
<code>8080</code> on target <code>10.5.5.5</code> exposing a service
with the alarming title "TOP SECRET DB". This finding directly
contradicts an existing internal risk record which incorrectly deems
this port "secured" with a CVSS score of <code>0.0</code>. This severe
discrepancy highlights a critical failure in risk assessment processes,
asset inventory, or vulnerability management, leading to a false sense
of security and posing an urgent, high-priority risk of potential data
breach or unauthorized access. Immediate investigation and remediation
are paramount.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-questionnaire-gaps">Analysis of
Questionnaire Gaps:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA for Email Access:</strong> The lack of MFA for email
accounts is a critical vulnerability. Email is a primary vector for
phishing, account takeover, and Business Email Compromise (BEC), making
accounts without MFA highly susceptible to unauthorized access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> The
absence of an AUP leaves employees without clear guidelines for
acceptable use of company IT resources, increasing risks of misuse,
non-compliance, and security incidents.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Annual Security Awareness Training:</strong> While new
employees receive training, the lack of annual refresher training means
employees may not be up-to-date on evolving threats and best practices,
degrading overall security posture over time.</p></li>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="technical-analysis">Technical Analysis:</h2>
<p>The discovery of port <code>8080</code> being open and exposing a
service titled "TOP SECRET DB" is an extremely critical finding. This
suggests that a potentially highly sensitive system or database is
openly accessible on the network. Without further investigation, the
exact nature of this "database" and the criticality of its contents
remain unknown, but the naming alone indicates a severe potential
information disclosure risk and a clear target for malicious actors.
This finding requires immediate and urgent attention.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following recommendations are provided to address the identified
risks and improve Orchid Isle’s cybersecurity posture:</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="immediate-actions-critical-risks">Immediate
Actions (Critical Risks)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Urgent Investigation of Port <code>8080</code> "TOP
SECRET DB":</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Immediately identify the system hosting the "TOP SECRET DB"
service on .</p></li>
<li><p>Determine the purpose, contents, and criticality of the data
exposed.</p></li>
<li><p>Assess whether this exposure is intentional, authorized, and
adequately secured. If not, immediately restrict external and internal
unauthorized access to the port/service and take steps to properly
secure the service.</p></li>
<li><p>If it is a test or legacy system, ensure it is properly
decommissioned, isolated, or secured.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Review and Rectify Risk Assessment
Processes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Conduct an urgent audit of all existing risk records,
particularly those relating to network services and open ports, to
identify other potential discrepancies.</p></li>
<li><p>Investigate why the internal record for Port <code>8080</code>
was marked as "Secured" with a CVSS of <code>0.0</code> despite the
active "TOP SECRET DB" service. This indicates a severe flaw in current
validation procedures.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement robust procedures for validating risk assessments
against real-world network data and regularly update asset inventories
and vulnerability statuses.</p></li>
<li><p>Establish a clear escalation path for discrepancies found between
internal risk records and active scan results.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="strategic-actions-high-risks">Strategic
Actions (High Risks)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email:</strong> Immediately enable and
enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts across
the organization. Prioritize user education and support during the
rollout.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a comprehensive AUP that clearly outlines
employee responsibilities and acceptable conduct when using company
resources. Distribute it to all employees, obtain signed
acknowledgements, and integrate it into onboarding processes and
periodic reviews.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Annual Security Awareness Training
Program:</strong> Implement a mandatory, recurring (at least annual)
security awareness training program for all employees. The training
should cover current threats, phishing recognition, secure browsing,
data handling, and incident reporting procedures. Track completion rates
and evaluate effectiveness.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>By addressing these critical and high-priority recommendations,
Orchid Isle can significantly enhance its overall cybersecurity posture
and reduce its attack surface.</p>
