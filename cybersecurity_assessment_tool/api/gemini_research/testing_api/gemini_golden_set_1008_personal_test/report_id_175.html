<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details a cybersecurity posture assessment for Open Door,
based on a security questionnaire, an external network scan, and a
review of existing vulnerabilities. The analysis reveals several
critical security gaps, predominantly in the areas of Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) implementation and new employee security awareness
training. An external scan identified an open SSH port (22), though
detailed service version information was not available in the provided
scan data. No pre-existing documented vulnerabilities were found.
Immediate recommendations prioritize the implementation of robust MFA
across critical services, enhancement of employee training programs, and
a thorough investigation and hardening of the identified open network
service. Adhering to these recommendations will significantly bolster
the organization’s defense against common cyber threats.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed to identify open ports and
services accessible from the internet.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not provided in scan
metadata.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address (IPv6):</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Method:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Open Port 22/TCP:</strong> This port was identified as
"open". While Nmap detected the port, the provided scan data did not
include detailed service information (e.g., specific service name,
product, or version running on this port). Port 22 is commonly used for
the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol, which allows secure remote
access.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: The absence of service version information limits the
ability to identify specific software vulnerabilities directly from this
scan data. Further investigation is recommended.</em></p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the security questionnaire, technical scan
results, and current risk data, the following key risks have been
identified:</p>

<th style="text-align: left;"><strong>Severity</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of MFA for Email Access</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Without Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA),
email accounts are highly susceptible to credential stuffing, phishing,
and brute-force attacks. Compromised email accounts can lead to
unauthorized access to sensitive communications, data, and potentially
other integrated systems.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Critical</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of MFA for Computer Login</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The absence of MFA for computer logins
represents a significant vulnerability, as compromised user credentials
could grant attackers direct access to internal systems, network
resources, and sensitive data without an additional layer of
verification.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Critical</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Inadequate New Employee Security
Training</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">New employees, lacking immediate and
mandatory security awareness training, may inadvertently become an
initial point of compromise due. They may be unaware of critical
organizational security policies, common phishing tactics, or secure
data handling procedures.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">High</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Open SSH Port (22) without Service
Details</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">An open SSH port, while legitimate for
remote access, can be a target for attackers attempting brute-force
logins or exploiting vulnerabilities in an unpatched or misconfigured
SSH server. The lack of service version details in the scan prevents an
immediate assessment of specific software risks.</td>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and enhance Open Door’s
cybersecurity posture, the following actionable recommendations are
provided:</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="critical-recommendations">Critical
Recommendations</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for All Core
Services:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediately deploy and enforce MFA for
all email accounts across the organization.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Implement MFA for all user logins to
computers, laptops, and internal network resources.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rationale:</strong> MFA significantly enhances security
by requiring a second form of verification, drastically reducing the
risk of account compromise even if passwords are stolen or
guessed.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="high-priority-recommendations">High-Priority
Recommendations</h2>
<ol start="2">
<li><p><strong>Enhance Security Awareness Training Program:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop and implement mandatory security
awareness training for all new employees as part of their onboarding
process. This training should cover common threats, organizational
policies, and reporting procedures.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Reinforce existing annual training with
more frequent, targeted modules focusing on current threats such as
sophisticated phishing attacks, social engineering, and
ransomware.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rationale:</strong> A well-informed and
security-conscious workforce is the first line of defense against many
cyber threats and human-error related incidents.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="medium-priority-recommendations">Medium-Priority
Recommendations</h2>
<ol start="3">
<li><p><strong>Secure and Monitor Open SSH Port (22):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Conduct a detailed vulnerability
assessment and service identification for the service running on port
22. Determine the exact service, product, and version.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Ensure the SSH service is running the
latest stable version and is configured securely. This includes
disabling root login, exclusively using strong key-based authentication
(disabling password authentication), implementing rate limiting on login
attempts, and restricting access via firewall rules to only necessary
source IP addresses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Implement continuous logging and
monitoring for unusual activity or failed login attempts on port
22.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rationale:</strong> An exposed and unhardened SSH service
can serve as a direct entry point into the network for malicious actors.
Proactive security measures are essential to protect against brute-force
attacks and exploitation of known vulnerabilities.</p></li>
