<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of Blue Marble, based
on a review of organizational security controls, a recent network scan,
and existing risk data. The assessment identified a mixed security
posture, with some commendable practices alongside significant critical
gaps.</p>
<p>Positively, Blue Marble conducts regular security awareness training
for all employees and mandates Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
computer logins. However, critical deficiencies were noted in the
absence of MFA for email access and sensitive data systems, as well as a
lack of a formal employee acceptable use policy.</p>
<p>The recent network scan of the target revealed no open ports, which
is a positive finding. This finding also contradicts a previously
reported existing risk concerning an "Unencrypted Web Server" on Port
80, suggesting potential remediation or a scope difference that warrants
further investigation.</p>
<p>Overall, immediate attention should be directed towards implementing
MFA broadly, establishing an AUP, and validating the current state of
pre-existing risks to strengthen the organization’s defense against
common attack vectors.</p>

<strong>Security Control Question</strong> &amp; <strong>Status</strong>
&amp; <strong>Analyst Commentary</strong><br />
Do you require MFA to access email? &amp; &amp; <strong>Critical
Gap:</strong> Lack of MFA for email significantly increases the risk of
account compromise through phishing or credential stuffing
attacks.<br />
Do you require MFA to log into computers? &amp; &amp; <strong>Good
Practice:</strong> Implementing MFA for computer logins enhances
endpoint security.<br />
Do you require MFA to access sensitive data systems? &amp; &amp;
<strong>Critical Gap:</strong> Sensitive data systems without MFA are
highly vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary credentials are
breached.<br />
Does your organization have an employee acceptable use policy? &amp;
&amp; <strong>High Risk:</strong> Absence of a formal Acceptable Use
Policy (AUP) can lead to misuse of company resources, increased insider
threat risk, and potential non-compliance issues.<br />
Does your organization do security awareness training for new employees?
&amp; &amp; <strong>Good Practice:</strong> Initial security awareness
training is crucial for establishing a baseline of understanding.<br />
Does your organization do security awareness training for all employees
at least once per year? &amp; &amp; <strong>Good Practice:</strong>
Regular, recurring security awareness training helps maintain employee
vigilance against evolving threats.<br />

&amp; Questionnaire<br />
<strong>Absence of Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)</strong> &amp; Without a
formal AUP, employees may be unaware of proper conduct regarding IT

<strong>Unencrypted Web Server</strong> &amp; Organization’s previously
reported risk of an unencrypted web server (Severity: Moderate, CVSS:
5.0). <em>Note: The latest network scan of indicates Port 80 is
currently <code>closed</code>. This suggests the risk may be remediated
or the affected host is outside the current scan’s scope. Further
investigation and validation are recommended to reconcile this

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the identified risks, the following actionable
recommendations are provided to enhance Blue Marble’s cybersecurity
posture.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="general-recommendations">General
Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA Across All Critical Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mandate Multi-Factor Authentication for all email accounts to
significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access.</p></li>
<li><p>Extend MFA requirements to all sensitive data systems and
applications to protect critical information assets.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create a comprehensive AUP outlining employee responsibilities
and appropriate use of all company IT resources (e.g., internet, email,
hardware, software).</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all employees receive training on the AUP and formally
acknowledge their understanding and agreement.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Validate Existing Risks and Scan Scope:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Conduct an internal review to verify the current status of the
"Unencrypted Web Server" risk. Confirm if Port 80 is indeed closed
across all relevant external interfaces, or if there are other
hosts/services where this risk might still be present.</p></li>
<li><p>If any public-facing web services exist and utilize HTTP (Port
80) without redirection to HTTPS, implement SSL/TLS encryption
immediately.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Continuous Monitoring:</strong> Implement continuous
monitoring solutions to detect and alert on any changes to network
configurations, newly exposed services, or deviations from security
baselines.</p></li>
