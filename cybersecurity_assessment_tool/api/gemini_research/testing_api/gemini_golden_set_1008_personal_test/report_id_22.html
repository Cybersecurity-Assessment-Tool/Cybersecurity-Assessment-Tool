<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings from a cybersecurity posture
assessment conducted for Bluebird Bio. The assessment involved a review
of organizational security controls through a questionnaire and an
external network scan.</p>
<p>Overall, Bluebird Bio demonstrates a foundational understanding of
critical security practices, particularly in requiring Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems. However,
several key areas require immediate attention to strengthen the
organization’s security posture. Critical gaps were identified
concerning the absence of MFA for computer logins, a lack of an Employee
Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), and insufficient annual security awareness
training for all employees. The external network scan did not reveal any
open ports, which is a positive indicator for external attack surface
management.</p>
<p>Addressing the identified gaps, especially those related to MFA and
clear employee policies, is paramount to mitigating significant risks
such as unauthorized access, data misuse, and human-factor
vulnerabilities. This report outlines specific recommendations to
address these findings and enhance the overall security resilience of
Bluebird Bio.</p>

<td style="text-align: left;">The organization does not require
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This
significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to endpoints if
credentials are compromised, leading to potential data breaches, malware
infections, or lateral movement within the network.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;">Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP)</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The organization lacks a formal Employee
Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). Without an AUP, employees may be unaware of
their responsibilities regarding the use of company resources, data, and
systems, increasing the likelihood of misuse, accidental data exposure,

<td style="text-align: left;">While new employees receive security
awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual security
awareness training for all employees. This gap means employees may not
be kept up-to-date with evolving threats, best practices, and policy

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following recommendations are provided to address the identified
risks and enhance Bluebird Bio’s overall cybersecurity posture. These
are prioritized based on the severity of the associated risks.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer
Logins (High Priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Evaluate and deploy an MFA solution for
all computer login processes across the organization. This could involve
hardware tokens, smartphone apps, or biometric authentication integrated
with your identity provider.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Significantly reduces the risk of
unauthorized access to workstations and servers even if primary
credentials are stolen or compromised.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP) (Medium Priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Draft a comprehensive AUP that clearly
outlines employee responsibilities regarding the use of company assets,
data, internet, email, and software.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Distribute the AUP to all employees,
obtain signed acknowledgements, and integrate it into new employee
onboarding processes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Provides clear guidelines for
employees, reduces accidental misuse of resources, and establishes a
foundation for disciplinary actions in case of policy
violations.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Annual Security Awareness Training for All
Employees (Medium Priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Implement a recurring (at least annual)
security awareness training program for all employees, not just new
hires.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Training should cover current threat
landscapes (e.g., phishing, ransomware), organizational policies, and
best practices for data protection and incident reporting.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Keeps employees informed about evolving
threats, reinforces security best practices, and reduces the likelihood
of human-factor security incidents.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Bluebird Bio has a solid foundation in some aspects of cybersecurity,
such as protecting sensitive data systems and email with MFA, and
maintaining a clean external attack surface. However, critical
vulnerabilities exist in the areas of endpoint login security, formal
employee policy, and ongoing security education. By diligently
implementing the recommended actions, Bluebird Bio can significantly
enhance its security posture, reduce its overall risk profile, and
better protect its valuable assets from cyber threats. Continued
vigilance and a proactive approach to cybersecurity are essential for
maintaining a strong defense against an ever-evolving threat
landscape.</p>
