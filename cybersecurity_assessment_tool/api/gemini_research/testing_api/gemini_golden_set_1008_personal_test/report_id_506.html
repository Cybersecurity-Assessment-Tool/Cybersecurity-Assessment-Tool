<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report presents a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for <strong>New Era</strong>. The analysis incorporates organizational
self-reported security controls, findings from a targeted network scan,
and pre-existing identified risks.</p>
<p><strong>New Era</strong> demonstrates a strong commitment to
fundamental security practices, particularly evident in its consistent
implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across critical
access points and a robust security awareness training program for
employees. These proactive measures significantly bolster defenses
against common attack vectors.</p>
<p>However, the assessment uncovered critical vulnerabilities within the
network infrastructure. Specifically, an outdated FTP service
(<code>vsftpd 2.3.4</code>) allowing anonymous access was identified.
This configuration presents an severe and immediate risk of unauthorized
data access, leakage, or potential system compromise. Furthermore, a
pre-existing risk concerning workstations running end-of-life Windows 7
operating systems contributes a medium-level threat due to unpatched
vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Immediate and decisive action is imperative to remediate the FTP
service vulnerabilities. Strategic planning should also prioritize the
upgrade of outdated operating systems to ensure a secure, compliant, and
resilient IT environment.</p>

<p>The consistent "Yes" responses across all questionnaire items
indicate a strong commitment from <strong>New Era</strong> to implement
foundational security controls. This proactive stance significantly

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was executed to identify active services and potential
vulnerabilities on the specified target.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="scan-details">Scan Details</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>10.0.0.15</code></p></li>

</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="identified-open-ports-and-services">Identified Open Ports and
Services</h2>
<p>The scan revealed the following open port and its associated
service:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 21 (FTP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Service Name:</strong> <code>ftp</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Product:</strong> <code>vsftpd</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Version:</strong> <code>2.3.4</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Script Output:</strong> Anonymous FTP login
allowed</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="technical-analysis-and-findings">Technical
Analysis and Findings</h2>
<p>The discovery of an FTP server running <code>vsftpd 2.3.4</code> on
port 21 is a <strong>critical security finding</strong>. This version of
<code>vsftpd</code> was released in 2011 and is known to contain
multiple severe vulnerabilities, most notably the CVE-2011-2523
backdoor, which permits arbitrary command execution. Operating an
unsupported and unpatched service of this age exposes the system to a
high likelihood of compromise by attackers leveraging well-known
exploits.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the server is configured to allow <strong>anonymous FTP
login</strong>. This configuration permits any user to connect to the
FTP server without providing credentials, thereby granting unauthorized
access to the server’s file system. This poses an immediate and severe
risk of data exfiltration, unauthorized file uploads (potentially
including malware), or other malicious activities that could lead to
system integrity violations or complete compromise.</p>

<p>This section synthesizes all identified risks, combining insights
from the security control review, technical scan results, and
pre-existing organizational risks. Risks are prioritized based on their

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actionable recommendations are provided to address the
identified risks and enhance <strong>New Era</strong>’s cybersecurity
posture. Recommendations are prioritized based on their severity.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="critical-recommendations">Critical
Recommendations</h2>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="disable-anonymous-ftp-access-immediately">1.
Disable Anonymous FTP Access Immediately</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Reconfigure the <code>vsftpd</code>
server to disallow anonymous logins. If FTP access is genuinely required
for specific use cases, ensure all users are authenticated with strong,
unique credentials. Consider implementing IP-based access restrictions
if possible.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Anonymous FTP access is a direct and
high-risk pathway for unauthorized individuals to interact with the
server’s file system, potentially leading to immediate data breaches,
malware deployment, or system compromise.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="upgrade-or-replace-outdated-ftp-service">2.
Upgrade or Replace Outdated FTP Service</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Immediate:</strong> If FTP is indispensable, upgrade
<code>vsftpd</code> to the latest stable and supported version. This
will address known vulnerabilities and improve overall
security.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Preferred:</strong> Decommission the FTP service entirely
if its functionality is not essential.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Alternative:</strong> Replace FTP with a more secure file
transfer protocol such as SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) or SCP
(Secure Copy Protocol). These protocols encrypt data in transit and
provide stronger authentication mechanisms, drastically reducing the
risk of eavesdropping and unauthorized access.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Rationale:</strong> <code>vsftpd 2.3.4</code> is an
end-of-life product with documented critical vulnerabilities. Continued
operation poses a significant and avoidable security liability.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="medium-recommendations">Medium
Recommendations</h2>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="upgrade-workstation-operating-systems">1.
Upgrade Workstation Operating Systems</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop and execute a phased plan to
upgrade all workstations currently running Windows 7 to a currently
supported operating system, such as Windows 10 or Windows 11. Ensure
that hardware compatibility and application requirements are assessed
during this transition.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Windows 7 has reached its end-of-life
status, meaning Microsoft no longer provides security updates, patches,
or technical support. Systems running Windows 7 are increasingly
vulnerable to new threats and exploits, posing a significant risk to the
integrity and confidentiality of data within the organizational
network.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p><strong>New Era</strong> has laid a commendable foundation in its
cybersecurity posture, especially concerning its robust multi-factor
authentication implementations and commitment to regular security
awareness training. This demonstrates a proactive and responsible
approach to security governance.</p>
<p>However, the assessment has identified critical immediate risks,
particularly the highly vulnerable and anonymously accessible FTP
service, along with the ongoing medium-level risk associated with
outdated Windows 7 workstations. Addressing these specific technical
vulnerabilities with urgency will significantly strengthen the
organization’s defenses against prevalent cyber threats. Continuous
vigilance, regular security assessments, and adherence to patch
management best practices are recommended to maintain and further
enhance <strong>New Era</strong>’s secure operational environment.</p>
