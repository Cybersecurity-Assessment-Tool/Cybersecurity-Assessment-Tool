<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides an assessment of the cybersecurity posture for
<strong>Aventine Research</strong>, primarily based on an organizational
security questionnaire. It is important to note that a full and
comprehensive technical analysis was constrained due to issues with the
provided network scan data (Input 1) and existing risk registry data
(Input 3).</p>
<p>The assessment reveals critical security gaps, notably the absence of
multi-factor authentication (MFA) for computer logins and the lack of
annual security awareness training for all employees. These findings
represent significant risks to the organization’s security posture.
Recommendations are provided to address these identified deficiencies
and improve overall resilience against cyber threats. A complete
assessment would benefit from all required data inputs being valid and
comprehensive.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-questionnaire-findings">Analysis
of Questionnaire Findings</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins:</strong> The absence of
multi-factor authentication for computer logins is a critical
vulnerability. Relying solely on passwords significantly increases the
risk of unauthorized access through credential compromise (e.g., via
phishing, malware, or brute-force attacks).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training:</strong>
The lack of mandatory annual security awareness training for all
employees means that staff may not be regularly updated on evolving
cyber threats, new phishing techniques, or organizational security
policies. This increases the susceptibility to human-factor incidents,
such as successful social engineering attacks.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>Analysis of technical network scan data was planned; however, the
provided ‘Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON‘ was malformed and did not contain
valid information regarding the target . Consequently, this report
cannot provide any specific technical findings related to open ports,
services, product versions, or potential vulnerabilities discovered via
network scanning. A comprehensive security assessment necessitates
complete and valid technical scan data.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the available information, particularly the findings from
the security control questionnaire, the following risks have been
identified. It is important to emphasize that a comprehensive risk
assessment typically integrates technical vulnerabilities (from network
scans) and existing organizational risk registers. Due to issues with
the provided data, these additional critical elements could not be
incorporated into this assessment.</p>

<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of MFA for Computer Logins</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Computers can be accessed using only a
single authentication factor (e.g., password). This significantly
elevates the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen
through phishing, malware, or brute-force attacks, potentially leading
to system compromise or data breach.</td>

<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Insufficient Security Awareness
Training</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Without consistent, annual security
awareness training for all employees, the organization’s human element
remains a significant attack vector. Employees may lack up-to-date
knowledge on current cyber threats, secure operational procedures, and
how to identify and report suspicious activities, increasing the
likelihood of successful social engineering or malware attacks.</td>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and strengthen the overall
cybersecurity posture of <strong>Aventine Research</strong>, the
following actionable recommendations are provided:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer
Logins:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Roll out and enforce multi-factor
authentication for all user logins to company computers, laptops, and
other endpoints. This should ideally be enforced at the operating system
login level or via a centralized identity provider.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Dramatically reduces the risk of
unauthorized access by ensuring that even if a password is compromised,
an attacker still needs a second factor (e.g., a physical token, a
one-time code from an app) to gain entry.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> Critical.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Mandatory Annual Security Awareness Training
for All Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop and implement a mandatory,
comprehensive annual security awareness training program for all
employees. The training should cover current threat landscapes, common
attack vectors (e.g., advanced phishing techniques, ransomware), secure
browsing habits, password management, proper data handling, and the
organization’s security policies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Transforms employees into an active
defense layer by equipping them with the knowledge and skills to
identify and respond to cyber threats, thereby reducing the likelihood
of successful human-factor attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> High.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Ensure Comprehensive and Valid Data for Future
Assessments:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> For any future security assessments,
establish processes to ensure that all requested data inputs (e.g.,
complete and valid network scan results, up-to-date vulnerability
registers, detailed system configurations) are provided in an accurate,
complete, and machine-readable format.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Enables the cybersecurity analyst to
perform a more thorough, accurate, and holistic assessment, leading to
the identification of a broader range of risks and the development of
more robust and targeted mitigation strategies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> Medium.</p></li>
