<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the current cybersecurity posture of White Label,
based on a security questionnaire, an attempted network scan, and an
attempted review of existing vulnerabilities. Due to corrupted or
unavailable data for the network scan and pre-existing vulnerabilities,
this assessment primarily focuses on organizational security controls
and policies as gathered from the provided questionnaire.</p>
<p>Key findings indicate that while White Label has implemented
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across critical access points (email,
computer logins, sensitive data systems), there are significant gaps in
foundational security practices, specifically regarding employee
security awareness and policy enforcement. The absence of an acceptable
use policy and security awareness training programs introduces
substantial human-factor risks that could be exploited.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>This section outlines key public-facing and self-reported information
about White Label.</p>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A self-assessment questionnaire was used to evaluate White Label’s
adherence to common cybersecurity best practices. The responses
highlight areas of strength and significant areas requiring immediate
attention.</p>

<h2 id="missing-risk-data">Missing Risk Data</h2>
<p>The provided data regarding pre-existing vulnerabilities was
corrupted or unavailable for analysis. Therefore, no existing
organizational risks could be incorporated into this assessment. A
comprehensive vulnerability management program, including regular
scanning and patching, is crucial for identifying and mitigating known
risks.</p>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified gaps and enhance the overall cybersecurity
posture of White Label, the following recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement a Comprehensive Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop, publish, and enforce an AUP that clearly outlines
permissible and prohibited use of organizational IT assets, networks,
and data.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all employees read and acknowledge the AUP, ideally on an
annual basis or upon significant policy changes.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Mandatory New Employee Security Awareness
Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and implement a mandatory security awareness training
program for all new hires.</p></li>
<li><p>This training should cover topics such as phishing, social
engineering, password hygiene, data handling, and reporting suspicious
activities.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Annual Security Awareness Training for All
Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement a recurring (at least annual) security awareness
training program for all employees.</p></li>
<li><p>Training content should be updated regularly to reflect current
threat landscapes and organizational policies.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider simulated phishing exercises to gauge employee
susceptibility and reinforce training.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct a Full Network Scan and Vulnerability
Assessment:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Due to the unavailability of technical scan data, a complete
external and internal network scan, along with a vulnerability
assessment, is strongly recommended.</p></li>
<li><p>This will identify open ports, running services, potential
misconfigurations, and known vulnerabilities on internet-facing assets
and internal systems.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement a Vulnerability Management
Program:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Establish a process for regularly identifying, assessing,
triaging, and remediating vulnerabilities across all IT assets.</p></li>
<li><p>This should include routine patch management, configuration
reviews, and security updates for all software and hardware.</p></li>
</ul></li>
