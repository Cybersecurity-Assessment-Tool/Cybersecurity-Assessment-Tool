<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of <strong>Titanium
Core</strong>, based on a recent network scan, organizational security
questionnaire responses, and an existing risk register. The analysis
reveals a mixed security posture with notable strengths in internal
access controls (MFA for computers and sensitive data) and employee
security awareness training. However, critical gaps exist in fundamental
areas such as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and the
formalization of an Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). A network scan
of the target indicated that Port 80, often associated with unencrypted
web services, was closed. This finding is critical as it potentially
mitigates a previously identified risk, though further validation is
recommended to confirm its current status. Immediate recommendations are
provided to address the identified vulnerabilities and enhance the
overall security stance.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="key-observations-from-questionnaire">Key
Observations from Questionnaire</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA for Email:</strong> The absence of mandatory MFA for
email access is a significant vulnerability. Email accounts are
frequently targeted by adversaries and can serve as a primary vector for
credential theft and subsequent lateral movement or data
exfiltration.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Employee Acceptable Use Policy:</strong> The lack of an
established Acceptable Use Policy can lead to ambiguity regarding
employee responsibilities and permissible use of organizational IT
resources, increasing risks of misuse and non-compliance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Positive Controls:</strong> The organization has positive
controls in place for MFA on computers and sensitive data systems, and a
commendable commitment to regular security awareness training. These are
strong foundational elements that should be maintained and potentially
expanded.</p></li>

</ul>
<p>No other open ports or active services were detected during this
scan. Details regarding service names, products, or versions were not
available in the provided scan data. The finding that Port 80 is closed
is positive, as it indicates the absence of an active, unencrypted HTTP
web server on this specific target.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To enhance the cybersecurity posture of <strong>Titanium
Core</strong>, the following actionable recommendations are
provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
Email Access:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediately implement and enforce MFA
for all employee and administrative email accounts across the
organization.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Significantly reduces the risk of email
account compromise, credential stuffing attacks, and unauthorized access
to linked services. This is a critical control for modern
cybersecurity.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Create a comprehensive AUP outlining the
proper and permissible use of organizational IT assets, data, and
networks. Ensure all employees are trained on the AUP, and obtain formal
acknowledgment of understanding and compliance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Establishes clear guidelines for
employee behavior, reduces misuse of resources, improves compliance with
legal and regulatory requirements, and provides a clear basis for
addressing policy violations.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Review and Validate Pre-existing Risk: Unencrypted Web
Server:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Investigate the discrepancy between the
pre-existing risk statement ("Port 80 is open") and the current network
scan results ("Port 80: Closed" on ). Confirm whether the risk has been
fully mitigated, applies to a different host/service not covered by this
scan, or if the risk register entry is outdated. Update the risk
register accordingly.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Ensures the accuracy and relevance of
the risk register, allowing for proper prioritization of resources on
currently active and significant threats. If the risk is still active on
other assets, appropriate remediation (e.g., implementing HTTPS/SSL
certificates) can be pursued.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Continue and Expand Security Awareness
Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Leverage the existing security awareness
training program to specifically educate employees on the importance of
MFA (especially for email) and the new AUP (once implemented). Include
updated training modules on identifying advanced phishing attempts and
social engineering tactics.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Reinforces secure behaviors, raises
overall security consciousness, and empowers employees to become an
effective first line of defense against cyber threats.</p></li>
</ul></li>
