<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture assessment for
<strong>Verve &amp; Vigor</strong>. The analysis is based on a network
scan, organizational security questionnaire responses, and a review of
existing internal risks. Key findings indicate significant
vulnerabilities related to outdated software, critical misconfigurations
(anonymous FTP access), and fundamental gaps in security controls such
as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and comprehensive
security awareness training. Addressing these issues is crucial to
enhancing the organization’s resilience against cyber threats and
reducing its attack surface.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-security-control-gaps">Analysis
of Security Control Gaps</h2>
<p>The following critical gaps were identified based on the
questionnaire responses:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Email (ID 1):</strong> Not requiring
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access significantly
increases the risk of account compromise. Credential stuffing, phishing,
and brute-force attacks become far more effective without this essential
layer of security, potentially leading to broader network intrusion or
sensitive data exfiltration.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inadequate Security Awareness Training (ID 5,
6):</strong> The absence of security awareness training for new hires
and annual training for all employees leaves the organization highly
vulnerable to social engineering attacks. Employees are often the first
line of defense; without proper and regular training, they can
inadvertently become an unwitting point of entry for attackers,
facilitating malware infections or credential theft.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan targeting the host was conducted. The specific scan
date was not explicitly provided in the metadata.</p>
<h2 id="host">Host </h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Status:</strong> The host was detected as
<strong>Up</strong> during the scan.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports and Services:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 21 (FTP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>State:</strong> Open</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Service Name:</strong> <code>ftp</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Product:</strong> <code>vsftpd</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Version:</strong> <code>2.3.4</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Script Findings (ftp-anon):</strong> The server is
configured to allow <code>Anonymous FTP login</code>. This means
unauthorized users can connect to the FTP server without providing valid
credentials.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of
Technical Findings</h2>
<p>The network scan revealed the following critical technical
vulnerabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Anonymous FTP Access (Port 21):</strong> The FTP server
on is misconfigured to allow anonymous logins. This grave
misconfiguration can enable unauthorized users to browse, read, write,
or delete files, depending on the server’s directory permissions. It
poses a severe risk of data leakage, unauthorized file uploads (e.g.,
malware or illicit content), or even full system compromise if sensitive
files are accessible.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Outdated FTP Server Software (vsftpd 2.3.4):</strong>
vsftpd version 2.3.4 was released in 2011 and is considered critically
end-of-life (EOL). This specific version is notoriously known to contain
critical vulnerabilities, including a backdoor vulnerability
(CVE-2011-2523) that could allow remote code execution. Running such
severely outdated software significantly elevates the risk of system
compromise and could provide an easy entry point for attackers.</p></li>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and significantly improve the
overall cybersecurity posture of Verve &amp; Vigor, the following
actionable recommendations are provided, categorized by priority.</p>
<h2 id="immediate-actions-critical-risks">Immediate Actions (Critical
Risks)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Disable Anonymous FTP:</strong> Immediately reconfigure
the FTP server on (and any other affected servers) to disable anonymous
login. Verify that only authorized users with strong credentials can
access the FTP service, and apply the principle of least privilege. If
FTP is not a business-critical service, consider disabling it entirely
or replacing it with a more secure protocol.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Update/Replace Outdated FTP Software:</strong> Prioritize
upgrading <code>vsftpd</code> to the latest stable, supported version,
or replace it with a more secure, actively maintained file transfer
solution (e.g., SFTP, SCP, or a commercial managed file transfer
service). Ensure all necessary security patches are applied immediately,
given the critical vulnerabilities in
<code>vsftpd 2.3.4</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="high-priority-actions">High Priority Actions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email:</strong> Deploy and enforce
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts across the
organization. This will add a crucial layer of security, significantly
reducing the risk of credential-based attacks, even if passwords are
compromised.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Comprehensive Security Awareness
Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and implement a mandatory security awareness training
program for all new employees during their onboarding process. This
training should cover essential topics such as phishing identification,
social engineering tactics, password hygiene, and incident reporting
procedures.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct annual, mandatory security awareness training for all
existing employees to refresh their knowledge and introduce new
threats.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade Outdated Operating Systems:</strong> Prioritize
the migration and upgrade of all workstations running Windows 7 to a
currently supported operating system (e.g., Windows 10 or 11). Operating
systems that are end-of-life no longer receive security updates, leaving
them highly vulnerable to new exploits. If immediate upgrades are not
feasible, isolate these systems from the main network and implement
strong compensating controls (e.g., restricted network access, advanced
endpoint protection).</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The cybersecurity posture assessment for Verve &amp; Vigor has
revealed several significant weaknesses, particularly concerning an
outdated and misconfigured FTP server, critical gaps in security
awareness training, and a lack of MFA for email access. These findings
present tangible risks that could lead to data breaches, system
compromises, and operational disruption. Proactive and timely
implementation of the provided recommendations will substantially
strengthen Verve &amp; Vigor’s defense against common cyber threats,
enhance its overall security posture, and protect its valuable assets.
Continued vigilance and regular security reviews are essential for
maintaining a strong defensive posture in the evolving threat
landscape.</p>
