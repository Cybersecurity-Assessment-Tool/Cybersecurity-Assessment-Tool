<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>The assessment of Wildfire Communications reveals a mixed
cybersecurity posture. While the organization has implemented
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins and
provides security awareness training to new employees, significant
vulnerabilities and control gaps have been identified. Specifically, the
lack of MFA for sensitive data systems, the absence of an Employee
Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), and the failure to conduct annual security
awareness training across all employees represent critical weaknesses. A
pre-existing high-severity risk, "Localhost Exposed" (CVSS 10.0),
further highlights a potential attack surface that needs urgent
investigation and remediation, even if the provided network scan data
was minimal. Addressing these areas is crucial for strengthening the
organization’s defense against cyber threats and achieving a more robust
security posture.</p>

<p>A network scan was performed targeting <code>127.0.0.1</code>. The
scan date was not specified in the provided metadata. The scan results
are summarized below.</p>

<p>The scan was specifically against the loopback address,
<code>127.0.0.1</code>. While this port (22, typically SSH) is open on
localhost, the significance of this finding in a broader context would
depend on the purpose and configuration of this local service,
especially when correlated with the "Localhost Exposed" pre-existing
risk.</p>

review, technical scan, and pre-existing vulnerabilities into a
comprehensive risk assessment.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="identified-gaps-from-questionnaire">Identified Gaps from
Questionnaire</h2>
<p>Based on the security control questionnaire, the following
high-priority gaps were identified:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Access:</strong> Without
MFA, sensitive data systems are vulnerable to credential stuffing,
phishing, and other password-based attacks, significantly increasing the
risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> A missing AUP means employees may not have clear
guidelines regarding the acceptable use of company assets and data. This
can lead to increased risks from insider threats, accidental data
exposure, and non-compliance with security best practices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Annual Security Awareness Training for All
Employees:</strong> While new employees receive training, the lack of
recurring annual training leaves the workforce susceptible to evolving
cyber threats, social engineering attacks, and outdated security
practices, diminishing the overall human firewall.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="pre-existing-and-technical-risks">Pre-existing and Technical
Risks</h2>

</div>
<p>The "Localhost Exposed" risk, with a CVSS score of 10.0, is of
paramount concern. While the network scan confirmed port 22 (SSH) open
on <code>127.0.0.1</code>, the criticality of this risk suggests a
deeper underlying issue beyond a standard local SSH service, potentially
implying misconfiguration, unnecessary exposure, or a critical
vulnerability within the service itself that was not detailed in the
provided scan data.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To enhance the cybersecurity posture of Wildfire Communications, the
following recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong>
Immediately deploy and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication for all
systems that process or store sensitive organizational data. This
significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised
credentials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a comprehensive AUP outlining the acceptable use
of company IT resources, data, and internet access. Ensure all employees
are trained on its contents and acknowledge their understanding and
compliance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Annual Security Awareness Training:</strong>
Establish and implement a mandatory annual security awareness training
program for all employees. This training should cover current threat
landscapes, social engineering techniques, secure data handling
practices, and phishing recognition.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Investigate and Remediate "Localhost Exposed"
Vulnerability:</strong> Urgently investigate the "Localhost Exposed"
vulnerability. This includes determining the exact nature of the
exposure, the service running on port 22 of <code>127.0.0.1</code>, its
necessity, and any associated vulnerabilities. Implement appropriate
remediation, which may include disabling unnecessary services,
restricting access, or applying security patches.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Comprehensive Vulnerability Scans:</strong>
Perform detailed vulnerability scans on all external and internal-facing
assets (including the external IP <code>205.215.139.65</code>) to
identify all open ports, running services, and associated
vulnerabilities, including version information. This will provide a more
complete picture of the attack surface.</p></li>
