<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture assessment for Fable
&amp; Lore, derived from a security questionnaire and a limited network
scan. While the technical scan of the specified internal host revealed
no open ports, indicating a potentially hardened system, significant
organizational risks were identified through the security questionnaire.
The absence of an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and critical gaps in
security awareness training for both new and existing employees
represent high-priority issues that could severely impact the
organization’s resilience against common cyber threats. Addressing these
policy and training deficiencies is crucial for elevating the overall
security posture and mitigating human-factor vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>A review of the organization’s security controls, based on responses

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on the target
<code>192.168.1.100</code>. It is important to note that this IP address
appears to be internal to the organization’s network, and the scope of
this scan was limited to this single host. No scan date was provided in
the input data.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="nmap-scan-findings">Nmap Scan Findings</h2>
<p>The Nmap scan reported the host <code>192.168.1.100</code> as up, but
found <strong>no open ports</strong> or services on the default scan
range. This is generally a positive finding for the scanned host,
indicating a potentially well-hardened internal system or one with
strict firewall rules.</p>
<p>However, without a broader scan of the organization’s external
perimeter () and other critical internal assets, a comprehensive
technical posture cannot be fully ascertained. The lack of detailed
service information (products, versions) is due to the absence of any
identified open ports.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the security questionnaire and the limited
technical scan, the following risks have been identified. No
pre-existing vulnerabilities were provided in the input data.</p>

<td style="text-align: left;">Cybersecurity threats constantly evolve.

it susceptible to emerging attack vectors and reducing overall
vigilance.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;">The scan was limited to a single internal

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To enhance Fable &amp; Lore’s cybersecurity posture and address the
identified risks, the following recommendations are provided:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a clear, comprehensive AUP that explicitly
outlines employee responsibilities, permitted/prohibited activities, and
expectations when using company IT assets. Ensure all employees read,
understand, and formally acknowledge the policy. Regular reviews and
updates are also recommended.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Mandatory New Employee Security
Training:</strong> Implement a robust and mandatory security awareness
training program for all new hires as part of their onboarding process.
This training should cover fundamental topics such as identifying
phishing attempts, safe browsing practices, password hygiene, data
handling best practices, and incident reporting procedures.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Annual Security Awareness Training for All
Employees:</strong> Conduct mandatory, organization-wide security
awareness training at least once per year. This training should be
updated regularly to reflect the current threat landscape, emerging
attack vectors, and reinforce critical security best practices. Consider
simulated phishing campaigns to test and improve employee
vigilance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Expand Network Scan Scope:</strong> Perform a
comprehensive network scan that includes the organization’s external
perimeter () and all critical internal assets. This broader scan will
provide a more complete picture of potential vulnerabilities, open
ports, and misconfigurations across the entire infrastructure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Scan Date Tracking:</strong> Ensure all future
technical scans include a clear scan date in their metadata for better
tracking, historical analysis, and auditability of security
assessments.</p></li>
