<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides an assessment of the current cybersecurity
posture for Crestview Analytics, based on a security questionnaire, a
network scan, and a review of existing risks.</p>
<p>The analysis reveals that Crestview Analytics has implemented several
key security controls, including Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
email and computer logins, and an annual security awareness training
program for all employees. However, critical gaps have been identified:
MFA is not uniformly applied to sensitive data systems, and new
employees do not receive initial security awareness training.</p>
<p>A targeted network scan identified an open SSH service (Port 22) on
one of the client’s systems. While the provided scan data did not
include specific service versions or vulnerabilities, an open port
represents an expanded attack surface. No pre-existing vulnerabilities
were provided for review.</p>
<p>The recommendations outlined in this report are designed to address
these identified gaps and findings, aiming to strengthen Crestview
Analytics’ overall cybersecurity defenses and reduce its exposure to
potential threats.</p>

<p>A network scan was performed to identify open ports and services on a

<p>The following open port was identified on the target system:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 22/TCP:</strong> This port is commonly associated
with the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol. The scan indicated the port is
<em>open</em>. No specific service name, product, or version information
was available in the provided scan data for this port.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The presence of an open SSH port suggests that remote access is
configured for the system. Without specific version information, it is
difficult to ascertain the patch level or potential vulnerabilities of
the running service.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To enhance the cybersecurity posture of Crestview Analytics, the
following actionable recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Mandate and enforce Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for all applications, databases, and systems that
store, process, or transmit sensitive organizational data. Prioritize
systems based on data classification and criticality.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> This will drastically reduce the risk
of unauthorized access, even in scenarios where primary credentials
(usernames and passwords) are compromised, thereby protecting sensitive
information.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish New Employee Security Awareness
Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop and implement a comprehensive,
mandatory security awareness training program for all new hires. This
training should be completed before new employees are granted access to
any organizational IT systems or data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Ensures that all employees, from their
first day, are equipped with the knowledge to identify and respond to
common cybersecurity threats, comply with organizational policies, and
minimize human-factor risks such as phishing or social
engineering.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Review and Secure Open Port 22 (SSH):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action 1 (Necessity Review):</strong> Determine if the
SSH service on is strictly necessary for current business operations. If
it is not, disable or remove the service immediately to eliminate the
attack surface.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action 2 (Hardening):</strong> If SSH is essential,
implement stringent security hardening measures:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Disable password authentication; enforce key-based
authentication.</p></li>
<li><p>Restrict SSH access to a whitelist of specific, authorized source
IP addresses/networks.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement rate-limiting on SSH connection attempts to mitigate
brute-force attacks.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure the SSH server software is running the latest stable and
patched version to protect against known vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p>Configure strong encryption algorithms and disable weak
ones.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Action 3 (Vulnerability Scan):</strong> Conduct a deeper,
authenticated vulnerability scan against the SSH service to identify any
specific vulnerabilities based on its version and
configuration.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Minimizes the risk of unauthorized
remote access, reduces the attack surface, and protects against
exploitation of known SSH vulnerabilities.</p></li>
</ul></li>
