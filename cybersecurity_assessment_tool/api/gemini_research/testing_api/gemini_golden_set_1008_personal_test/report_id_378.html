<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment for Willow Creek Health. The assessment combined an external
network scan, a review of organizational security controls through a
questionnaire, and an analysis of pre-existing identified risks.</p>
<p>Overall, the organization exhibits critical gaps in foundational
security controls, particularly concerning Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) and Security Awareness Training (SAT). While the recent external
network scan did not identify any open ports on the specified target,
suggesting a minimal external attack surface for that specific host, the
absence of MFA and SAT creates significant internal vulnerabilities that
could lead to credential compromise and successful social engineering
attacks. A pre-existing risk concerning an "Unencrypted Web Server" on
Port 80 was noted, though the current scan indicated Port 80 as closed,
warranting further verification. Addressing the identified control
deficiencies is paramount to improving the organization’s security
posture.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-questionnaire-findings">Analysis
of Questionnaire Findings</h2>
<p>The questionnaire responses highlight several critical security
control deficiencies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins and Sensitive Data
Systems:</strong> While MFA is used for email, its absence for computer
logins and access to sensitive data systems represents a significant
vulnerability. Credential compromise (e.g., via phishing) could grant
attackers direct access to internal systems and critical data without a
second factor.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Insufficient Security Awareness Training (SAT):</strong>
The lack of SAT for new employees and annual refresher training for all
employees leaves the organization highly susceptible to social
engineering attacks, phishing, and human error, which are leading causes
of data breaches.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed on the specified target IP
address using Nmap.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target Scanned:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Used:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> 2026-01-26</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="findings">Findings</h2>
<p>The scan indicated that the target was "up" but no open ports were
identified. Specifically, port 80, which was referenced in an existing
vulnerability report, was found to be <code>closed</code> during this
assessment. This suggests that either the "Unencrypted Web Server" issue
has been remediated, or the original risk pertained to a different
system, or the information was outdated. No services, products, or
versions could be enumerated due to the absence of open ports.</p>

the questionnaire, the findings from the technical scan, and
pre-existing vulnerabilities into a comprehensive risk overview.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To significantly improve Willow Creek Health’s cybersecurity posture,
the following recommendations are provided:</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="multi-factor-authentication-mfa">Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for All Systems:</strong> Mandate MFA for
all user logins to internal computers, network resources, and especially
all sensitive data systems. This is a critical control against
credential theft and unauthorized access.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="security-awareness-training-sat">Security
Awareness Training (SAT)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Comprehensive New Employee SAT:</strong> Develop and
implement mandatory security awareness training for all new employees
during their onboarding process.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Annual All-Employee SAT:</strong> Establish and enforce
an annual (or more frequent) security awareness training program for all
employees to keep security top-of-mind and address evolving threats.
Training should cover topics such as phishing, social engineering,
password hygiene, and incident reporting.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="policy-and-procedure">Policy and
Procedure</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Review and Enforce AUP:</strong> Regularly review and
update the employee acceptable use policy (AUP) to reflect current best
practices and organizational requirements. Ensure the AUP is
communicated effectively and consistently enforced.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="technical-controls-risk-management">Technical
Controls &amp; Risk Management</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Verify Existing Risks:</strong> Investigate the
"Unencrypted Web Server" risk further. Determine if it was remediated,
if it applies to a different asset, or if the original information was
inaccurate. Update the risk register accordingly.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Vulnerability Scanning:</strong> Implement a
program for regular external and internal vulnerability scanning. This
includes regular scans of all externally facing IP addresses and
internal networks to identify and remediate potential vulnerabilities
before they can be exploited.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Patch Management:</strong> Ensure a robust patch
management process is in place to keep all operating systems,
applications, and network devices up-to-date with the latest security
patches.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These recommendations, when implemented, will significantly reduce
the organization’s attack surface and overall risk profile.</p>
