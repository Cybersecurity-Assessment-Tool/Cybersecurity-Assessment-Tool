<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of Blackwood Industries
based on a review of organizational security controls, a basic network
scan, and an assessment of currently reported risks. The network scan
against <code>192.168.1.100</code> found no open ports, which is a
positive indicator for external exposure. However, several critical gaps
were identified through the security questionnaire, representing the
primary risks to the organization. These include the absence of
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins, a lack of a
formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), and the absence of
dedicated security awareness training for new employees. These
deficiencies represent considerable vulnerabilities that could lead to
unauthorized access, data breaches, and non-compliance. Urgent
recommendations are provided to address these deficiencies and
significantly enhance Blackwood Industries’ overall security
posture.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A basic network scan was performed targeting
<code>192.168.1.100</code> to identify open ports and associated
services.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>192.168.1.100</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> 2026-01-26<br />
(Note: The specific scan_date was not provided in the input metadata;
current date is used for report generation.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> The target host was found to be
<code>up</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports:</strong> No open ports were identified during
this scan. All scanned extraports were reported as <code>closed</code>.
This finding suggests that the system may be well-hardened or protected
by a firewall, limiting its direct exposure. Further comprehensive
scanning and internal assessments would be required to fully ascertain
the system’s network exposure and identify any less common or internally
exposed services.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of security control responses from the
questionnaire and the technical scan results, the following key risks
have been identified. No pre-existing vulnerabilities were provided for
this assessment, meaning the current risk profile is primarily driven by
policy and human factor gaps.</p>

<td style="text-align: left;">Authentication</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Employees can log into computers using
only a single factor (e.g., password). This significantly increases the

<td style="text-align: left;">Without an AUP, employees lack clear,
formalized guidelines on the acceptable use of organizational IT
resources, data, and communication channels. This gap can lead to misuse
of assets, data breaches due to negligence, non-compliance with
regulations, and legal exposure.</td>

New Employees</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">High</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Human Factor</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">New employees are onboarded without
mandatory security awareness training, making them particularly
vulnerable to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting)
and increasing the likelihood of unintentional security lapses or the
introduction of vulnerabilities through unaware actions.</td>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actionable recommendations are provided to mitigate the
identified risks and significantly enhance Blackwood Industries’ overall
cybersecurity posture:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for All
Computer Logins:</strong> Mandate and enforce Multi-Factor
Authentication for all user authentications to corporate endpoints,
servers, and internal applications. This critical control adds a
substantial layer of security against credential compromise, making it
significantly harder for unauthorized individuals to gain access even if
they obtain a user’s password.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement a Formal Employee Acceptable Use
Policy (AUP):</strong> Create a comprehensive and clearly articulated
Employee Acceptable Use Policy. This policy should define acceptable use
of company IT assets (hardware, software, networks), proper data
handling procedures, guidelines for internet and email usage, and
prohibited activities. The AUP must be distributed to all employees,
with mandatory acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, to
establish clear expectations and reduce organizational risk.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mandate Security Awareness Training for New
Hires:</strong> Integrate a mandatory, comprehensive security awareness
training program as a critical component of the onboarding process for
all new employees. This training should cover common cybersecurity
threats such as phishing, social engineering tactics, secure password
practices, data protection protocols, and reporting suspicious
activities. Early and consistent training will equip new hires with the
knowledge to identify and avoid common threats, reducing the human
factor risk.</p></li>
