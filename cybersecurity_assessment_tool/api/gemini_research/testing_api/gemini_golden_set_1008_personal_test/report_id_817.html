<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the current cybersecurity posture of Titanium
Core, based on a network scan, organizational security questionnaire,
and existing risk data. The assessment reveals several critical gaps in
security controls and a moderate technical vulnerability. Specifically,
the organization lacks Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer
logins and sensitive data systems, does not have an Acceptable Use
Policy (AUP), and has no structured security awareness training
programs. Furthermore, the identified web server is running an outdated
version of Nginx. These findings indicate a weak overall security
posture that could significantly increase the risk of unauthorized
access, data breaches, and other cyber incidents. Immediate attention to
the outlined recommendations is strongly advised to enhance the
organization’s resilience against modern cyber threats.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed to identify open ports, services, and

<h2 id="identified-open-ports-and-services">Identified Open Ports and

<p>The scan revealed the following open port and associated service
details:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port:</strong> <code>443/tcp</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>State:</strong> Open</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Service Name:</strong> HTTPS</p></li>

</ul>
<h3 id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of Technical
Findings</h3>
<p>The Nginx web server running version <code>1.18.0</code> is
considered outdated. Nginx 1.18.0 was released in 2020 and is part of
the ’old stable’ branch which eventually reached end-of-life for active
feature development and often for security patching depending on the
distribution. Running outdated software can expose the organization to
known vulnerabilities for which patches exist but have not been applied.
Modern stable versions like Nginx 1.24.x or 1.26.x offer improved
security features and critical vulnerability fixes.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and improve Titanium Core’s overall
cybersecurity posture, the following recommendations are provided:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for All
Computer Logins:</strong> Deploy and enforce MFA for all employee and
administrative access to organizational computers and networks. This
significantly raises the bar for attackers even if they obtain user
credentials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive
Data Systems:</strong> Ensure that all systems containing or processing
sensitive data require MFA for access. This critical control protects
against unauthorized access to valuable information assets.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a comprehensive AUP that clearly outlines
employee responsibilities regarding the use of company IT resources,
data handling, and internet usage. Ensure all employees read,
understand, and sign the policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Mandatory Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong> Integrate a robust security awareness training
program into the onboarding process for all new hires. This should cover
common threats, organizational policies, and best practices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Annual Security Awareness Training for All
Employees:</strong> Implement mandatory annual security awareness
training for all existing employees. This regular refresh helps
reinforce security principles and educates staff on the latest threats
and compliance requirements.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade Nginx Web Server Software:</strong> Plan and
execute an upgrade of the Nginx web server to a currently supported and
stable version (e.g., 1.24.x or 1.26.x). Ensure thorough testing is
performed before deployment to production environments to prevent
service disruption. Regularly patch all software components.</p></li>
