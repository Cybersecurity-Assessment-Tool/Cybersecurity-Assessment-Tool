<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This document presents a comprehensive cybersecurity posture
assessment, synthesizing data from a network scan, organizational
security questionnaire, and existing risk registers. The objective is to
provide Iron Oak Furniture with a clear understanding of its current
security standing, identify potential vulnerabilities, and offer
actionable recommendations for improvement.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following information was provided by Iron Oak Furniture:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Organization Name:</strong> Iron Oak Furniture</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Email Domain:</strong>
<code>IronOakFurniture.org</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Website Domain:</strong> <a

<li><p><strong>External IP Address:</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A review of Iron Oak Furniture’s security controls was conducted
based on responses to a targeted questionnaire. The findings are
summarized below:</p>

</div>
<h2 id="questionnaire-analysis">Questionnaire Analysis</h2>
<p>The questionnaire results indicate a strong commitment to
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), which significantly enhances
protection against unauthorized access across email, computers, and
sensitive data systems. The regular security awareness training for both
new and existing employees is also a commendable practice that
strengthens the human firewall.</p>
<p>However, a critical gap was identified: the absence of an employee
acceptable use policy. This policy is fundamental for setting clear
expectations regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources,
data, and internet access, thereby mitigating various insider risks and
enhancing compliance.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed targeting an internal host within the
Iron Oak Furniture environment.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target Host:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Status:</strong> Host is up.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports Detected:</strong> None. The scan indicated
that no open ports were found on the target host, and extra ports were
reported as closed.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="technical-analysis">Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>The network scan results for are positive, indicating a secure
posture for this specific host with no exposed services or open ports
detected. This minimizes the attack surface from a network perspective
for this particular device. It is important to note that this scan was
limited to a single internal IP address and may not reflect the security
posture of the entire network or other systems.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the organizational data and questionnaire,
the following risks have been identified:</p>

<td style="text-align: left;">Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP)</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The organization currently lacks a formal
Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) for employees. Without clear guidelines on
the appropriate use of company IT assets, data, and internet resources,
there is an increased risk of misuse, data breaches, compliance
violations, and legal liabilities.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">High</td>

</div>
<p>No pre-existing vulnerabilities were provided in the current risks
register. The network scan for did not reveal any technical
vulnerabilities (such as open ports or outdated services) that would
constitute a risk at this time.</p>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To enhance Iron Oak Furniture’s cybersecurity posture, the following
recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Draft, formalize, and implement a
comprehensive AUP that clearly outlines employee responsibilities
regarding the use of company systems, internet, email, data, and other
IT resources.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Details:</strong> The policy should cover topics such as
prohibited activities, privacy expectations, intellectual property, data
handling, software installation, and reporting security
incidents.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> This will mitigate insider threats,
reduce data leakage risks, ensure compliance with relevant regulations,
and provide a basis for disciplinary action in case of misuse.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Regular Policy Reviews and Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Integrate the new AUP into new employee
onboarding processes and regular security awareness training sessions
for all employees.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Details:</strong> Ensure employees understand the policy
and acknowledge their agreement to abide by it. Review the AUP annually
or as business needs and regulations change.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Ensures that the policy remains
relevant and that all employees are continuously aware of their
responsibilities.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Expand Network Scanning Scope (Optional but
Recommended):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> While the scan of yielded positive
results, consider expanding future network scans to cover a broader
range of internal and external IP addresses, critical servers, and
network devices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Details:</strong> This will provide a more comprehensive
view of the organization’s entire attack surface.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Proactively identifies potential
vulnerabilities across the whole infrastructure before they can be
exploited.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Iron Oak Furniture demonstrates a commendable stance on crucial
security controls like Multi-Factor Authentication and regular security
awareness training. Addressing the absence of an Employee Acceptable Use
Policy is the most immediate and impactful step to further solidify the
organization’s cybersecurity defenses. By implementing the recommended
policy, Iron Oak Furniture can significantly reduce operational and
compliance risks, fostering a more secure and responsible work
environment.</p>
