<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings from a cybersecurity posture
assessment for <strong>Radiant Life</strong>. The assessment was
conducted by analyzing organizational security questionnaire responses,
attempting to review network scan data, and pre-existing risk
information.</p>
<p>Key findings indicate critical gaps in multi-factor authentication
(MFA) implementation for computer logins and sensitive data systems, as
well as a lack of regular annual security awareness training for all
employees. Unfortunately, the provided network scan data (Input 1) and
existing vulnerabilities data (Input 3) were malformed and could not be
processed, preventing a comprehensive technical security analysis and a
review of documented risks. As a result, this report primarily focuses
on identified policy and control deficiencies. Recommendations are
provided to address these critical areas and enhance the overall
security posture.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and improve the overall security
posture of <strong>Radiant Life</strong>, the following recommendations
are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Logins:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Deploy and enforce Multi-Factor
Authentication for all employee computer logins, particularly for
endpoints connecting to the internal network.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Significantly reduces the risk of
unauthorized access even if primary credentials are compromised,
aligning with modern security best practices.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Extend MFA requirements to all systems
and applications that host or process sensitive organizational or
customer data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Provides an additional layer of
security for critical assets, protecting against data breaches and
enhancing compliance.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Annual Security Awareness Training
Program:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop and implement a mandatory annual
security awareness training program for all employees, not just new
hires.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Keeps employees informed about current
threats (e.g., phishing, social engineering, ransomware), reinforcing
secure behaviors and turning them into an effective first line of
defense.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct a Full Network Security Scan:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Perform a comprehensive network scan to
identify open ports, running services, and potential vulnerabilities on
and other critical assets.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Provides a crucial technical baseline
for understanding external exposure and identifying configuration
weaknesses.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Document and Review Existing Risks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Ensure that an up-to-date and accurate
register of existing vulnerabilities and risks is maintained and
regularly reviewed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Facilitates proactive risk management
and informed decision-making regarding resource allocation for security
improvements.</p></li>
