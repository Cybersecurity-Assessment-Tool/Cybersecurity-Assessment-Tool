<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for <strong>Harbor Light Foundation</strong>, based on a recent network
scan, organizational security questionnaire responses, and a review of
existing risks.</p>
<p>The assessment reveals a mixed security posture with several critical
gaps identified. While basic security awareness and Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins are in place, the
lack of MFA for sensitive data systems and the absence of an employee
acceptable use policy represent significant vulnerabilities.
Furthermore, the network scan identified an outdated Nginx web server
version (1.18.0) that poses a high risk due to potential unpatched
vulnerabilities. Immediate action is recommended to address these
findings to strengthen the organization’s overall security posture.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-security-control-gaps">Analysis
of Security Control Gaps</h2>
<p>The following critical security control gaps were identified based on
best practices:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> The
absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for sensitive data systems
significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access. If an attacker
obtains legitimate user credentials, they could gain access to critical
and sensitive information without an additional layer of security. This
is a critical vulnerability for data confidentiality.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> Without
a formal AUP, employees may lack clear guidelines regarding the proper
and secure use of organizational IT resources. This gap can lead to
accidental or intentional misuse of systems, data breaches, and
potential compliance violations due to unmanaged employee
behavior.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on the target IP address on 2025-11-22
at 10:00:00Z. The scan revealed the following open ports and
services:</p>

</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="technical-analysis">Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>The primary technical finding is the presence of an Nginx web server
running version 1.18.0 on port 443. Nginx 1.18.0 was released in April
2020 and is now considered significantly outdated. Current stable
versions are in the 1.26.x series (as of late 2024). Running an outdated
web server exposes the organization to numerous known vulnerabilities
that have since been patched in newer versions. This significantly
increases the attack surface for potential exploits, including but not
limited to denial-of-service attacks, information disclosure, and remote
code execution, depending on specific vulnerabilities affecting this
version.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the comprehensive analysis of the security questionnaire
responses and the technical scan results, the following risks have been
identified. No pre-existing risks were provided in the input data.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and significantly improve the
overall cybersecurity posture of Harbor Light Foundation, the following
actionable recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade Nginx Web Server:</strong> Immediately plan and
execute an upgrade of the Nginx web server on to the latest stable
version (e.g., 1.26.x). Ensure a thorough testing process in a staging
environment is performed before deploying the upgrade to production to
prevent service disruption.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong>
Mandate and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication for all sensitive data
systems. This critical control adds a robust layer of security,
significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access even if primary
credentials are stolen or guessed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy
that clearly outlines expectations for secure and appropriate technology
usage. Distribute the AUP to all employees, obtain their formal
acknowledgment, and integrate it into new employee onboarding and annual
reviews.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Security Audits and Patch Management:</strong>
Establish a routine schedule for security audits, vulnerability
scanning, and proactive patch management for all software, operating
systems, and network devices. This ensures ongoing identification and
remediation of vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Review SSL Certificate Management:</strong> While not a
direct vulnerability, the SSL certificate for
<code>commonName=www.acme-corp.com</code> is being used on
<code>192.168.10.5</code>. Verify that this is the intended certificate
for the hosted content and that its ownership and validity are properly
managed and regularly renewed to prevent expired certificate errors or
trust issues.</p></li>
