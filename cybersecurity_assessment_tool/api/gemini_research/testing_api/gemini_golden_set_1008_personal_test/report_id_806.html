<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for <strong>Arcane Security</strong>, incorporating data from a network
scan, organizational security questionnaire, and pre-existing risk
register. The analysis reveals critical vulnerabilities, notably the
absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access, the
operation of a severely outdated and vulnerable FTP service
(<code>vsftpd</code> 2.3.4) with anonymous login enabled, and the
continued use of end-of-life Windows 7 operating systems. These issues
collectively present significant risks to data confidentiality,
integrity, and system availability. Immediate and decisive action is
required to remediate these critical findings and enhance the
organization’s overall security resilience.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-security-controls">Analysis of
Security Controls</h2>
<p>While the organization demonstrates commendable practices in
implementing MFA for sensitive data systems and computer logins,
alongside robust security awareness training and acceptable use
policies, a significant deficiency exists. The absence of Multi-Factor
Authentication for email access (SC-001) represents a critical
vulnerability. Email is a primary vector for phishing, business email
compromise, and credential theft, making its protection with MFA
paramount to preventing unauthorized access and subsequent broader
system compromises.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A targeted network scan was conducted, focusing on the internal host
. The scan identified the following open ports and services:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> 2026-01-27</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports and Services:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 21 (FTP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Service Name:</strong> <code>ftp</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Product:</strong> <code>vsftpd</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Version:</strong> <code>2.3.4</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Script Output:</strong>
<code>Anonymous FTP login allowed</code></p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="technical-analysis">Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>The identification of an open FTP service running <code>vsftpd</code>
version 2.3.4 is a <strong>critical security finding</strong>. This
version, released in 2011, is notoriously outdated and contains a severe
backdoor vulnerability (CVE-2011-2523) that allows for arbitrary command
execution. This vulnerability enables a remote attacker to gain full
control over the affected system. Compounding this, the server
explicitly permits anonymous FTP logins, which can lead to unauthorized
access, data exposure, arbitrary file uploads, and further exploitation,
even without leveraging the specific backdoor. This configuration poses
an immediate and severe threat to the confidentiality, integrity, and
availability of the server and potentially the wider network.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and significantly enhance the
cybersecurity posture of <strong>Arcane Security</strong>, the following
actionable recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email
Access:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediately deploy and enforce MFA for
all user accounts accessing organizational email.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rationale:</strong> MFA is a fundamental security control
that provides a strong defense against credential theft and unauthorized
access, even if passwords are compromised.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Decommission or Secure the FTP Service at :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Given the critical vulnerabilities and
anonymous access, the FTP service should be immediately decommissioned
if it is not absolutely essential. If an FTP-like service is required,
replace it with a secure alternative (e.g., SFTP, FTPS) running a
current, supported version, with strong authentication, disabled
anonymous access, and strict access controls.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rationale:</strong> The current FTP setup is an open and
severe vulnerability that could lead to complete system compromise and
data loss.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade End-of-Life Operating Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop and execute a comprehensive plan
to upgrade all Windows 7 machines to a currently supported operating
system (e.g., Windows 10 or 11) within a defined timeframe.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Running unsupported operating systems
means systems are permanently vulnerable to newly discovered exploits
and cannot be patched, creating a significant attack surface.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Enhance and Tailor Security Awareness
Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> While security awareness training
exists, ensure it specifically covers the importance of MFA, advanced
phishing identification techniques, and procedures for reporting
suspicious activities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rationale:</strong> User education is a critical defense
layer, helping to prevent human error from becoming a security
incident.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Continuous Vulnerability Management and
Patching:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Establish a robust, continuous
vulnerability scanning and patch management program across all assets.
This includes regular scans, timely application of security patches, and
verification of remediation efforts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Proactive identification and
remediation of vulnerabilities are essential to maintaining a strong
security posture against evolving threats.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The cybersecurity assessment for <strong>Arcane Security</strong>
reveals several critical weaknesses that demand immediate attention. By
prioritizing the implementation of MFA for email, securing or
decommissioning the vulnerable FTP service, and upgrading end-of-life
operating systems, the organization can substantially mitigate its
current risk exposure. Adherence to these recommendations will
significantly bolster the organization’s defenses, protect sensitive
data, and strengthen its overall resilience against cyber threats.</p>
