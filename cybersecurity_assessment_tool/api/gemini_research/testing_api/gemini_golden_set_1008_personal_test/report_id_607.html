<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for <strong>Neon Pulse Entertainment</strong>. The analysis combines
insights from their self-reported security controls, a network scan of a
specified target, and a review of existing organizational risks. The
assessment reveals several critical vulnerabilities: a notable absence
of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, and
a complete lack of employee security awareness training. These findings
suggest a significant exposure to common cyber threats, including
phishing, credential theft, and social engineering. While the network
scan detected only one open port (SSH), its presence without specified
hardening measures contributes to the overall risk. Urgent
implementation of MFA, mandatory security awareness programs, and
diligent SSH hardening are recommended to bolster the organization’s
defenses against current and evolving threats.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-questionnaire-findings">Analysis
of Questionnaire Findings</h2>
<p>The questionnaire responses indicate significant vulnerabilities in
the organization’s foundational security practices:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Email and Computer Access:</strong> The
absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for both email access and
computer logins represents a critical weakness. This exposes the
organization to severe risks from credential theft, phishing, and
brute-force attacks, as a single compromised password could grant
unauthorized access to critical systems and data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of Security Awareness Training:</strong> The lack
of security awareness training for both new and existing employees is a
major concern. Human error and social engineering are leading causes of
cybersecurity incidents. Without regular training, employees are more
susceptible to phishing, malware, and other social engineering tactics,
potentially compromising the entire organization.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Positive Controls:</strong> It is positive that MFA is
required for sensitive data systems and that an acceptable use policy is
in place. These are good baseline controls, but their effectiveness is
diminished by the significant gaps identified elsewhere.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on the target .</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Target:</strong> (IPv6)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not provided in source data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Used:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> Up</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports Identified:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 22:</strong> State: Open. (Typically associated with
SSH - Secure Shell Protocol). No service name, product, or version
information was provided in the scan data for this port.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-technical-scan-findings">Analysis
of Technical Scan Findings</h2>
<p>The network scan identified only one open port, Port 22, commonly
used for SSH (Secure Shell). While SSH is a legitimate protocol for
remote access and management, its exposure carries inherent risks if not
properly secured. Without information on the specific SSH server
version, configuration, or allowed authentication methods, it’s
impossible to determine the precise level of vulnerability. However, any
open port is a potential attack surface. Risks include brute-force
attacks, credential stuffing, and exploitation of software
vulnerabilities if the SSH server is outdated or misconfigured.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of organizational data and technical scan
results, the following key risks have been identified. No pre-existing
vulnerabilities were provided in the input data.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and significantly improve
<strong>Neon Pulse Entertainment</strong>’s cybersecurity posture, the
following recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Universally:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Mandate MFA for Email:</strong> Immediately implement and
enforce MFA for all organizational email accounts. This is a critical
first step to protect against phishing and credential stuffing
attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Logins:</strong> Deploy MFA
solutions for all employee computer logins, particularly for
administrative and privileged user accounts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Review MFA Coverage:</strong> Periodically review and
extend MFA requirements to other sensitive internal systems and cloud
services not currently protected.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Comprehensive Security Awareness Training
Programs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Onboarding Training:</strong> Develop and implement
mandatory cybersecurity awareness training for all new employees as part
of their onboarding process.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Annual Refresher Training:</strong> Conduct regular (at
least annual) security awareness training for all employees. Topics
should include phishing detection, social engineering tactics, password
hygiene, data handling best practices, and incident reporting
procedures.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Simulated Phishing Campaigns:</strong> Consider running
simulated phishing campaigns to test employee vigilance and provide
targeted training.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Harden SSH Configuration on :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Key-Based Authentication:</strong> Disable password
authentication for SSH and enforce the use of strong SSH keys.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Disable Root Login:</strong> Configure the SSH server to
disallow direct root login.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Least Privilege Access:</strong> Limit SSH access to
specific, trusted IP addresses or networks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Update Software:</strong> Ensure the SSH server software
is kept up-to-date with the latest security patches.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>MFA for SSH (Optional but Recommended):</strong> Explore
options to integrate MFA into the SSH login process for an added layer
of security.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Port Change (Optional):</strong> Consider changing the
default SSH port (22) to a non-standard port to reduce automated
scanning attempts, although this does not provide true security by
obscurity.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Regular Vulnerability Scanning and Penetration
Testing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement a schedule for regular internal and external
vulnerability scanning to proactively identify and address security
weaknesses.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider engaging a third party for periodic penetration testing
to simulate real-world attacks and uncover deeper
vulnerabilities.</p></li>
