<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This document presents a comprehensive cybersecurity posture
assessment for <strong>Brimstone Manufacturing</strong>. The objective
of this assessment is to identify current security strengths,
weaknesses, and potential risks by analyzing data from three distinct
sources: organizational security questionnaire responses, a technical
network scan, and an inventory of existing vulnerabilities. The findings
and recommendations herein are designed to provide a clear roadmap for
improving the overall security landscape of the organization.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following information was gathered from the client regarding
their organizational details:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Organization Name:</strong> Brimstone
Manufacturing</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Email Domain:</strong>
<code>BrimstoneManufacturing.net</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Website Domain:</strong>
<code>www.BrimstoneManufacturing.net</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>External IP Address:</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A security questionnaire was completed by Brimstone Manufacturing to
assess the implementation of various security controls. The responses
indicate several areas where security practices could be
strengthened.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-questionnaire-findings">Analysis of Questionnaire
Findings</h2>
<p>The review of security controls reveals critical gaps, particularly
concerning the deployment of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and the
establishment of foundational security policies and training. The
absence of MFA for email and sensitive data systems significantly
increases the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised
credentials. Furthermore, the lack of an acceptable use policy (AUP) and
annual security awareness training creates a substantial human factor
risk, potentially leading to policy violations and susceptibility to
social engineering attacks.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed to identify active hosts and open ports.
The scan metadata is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not explicitly provided in the scan
metadata.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Used:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="summary-of-findings">Summary of Findings</h2>
<p>The scan identified one active host:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Host:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Status:</strong> Up</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 22:</strong> Open (Commonly used for SSH - Secure
Shell)</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of Technical
Findings</h2>
<p>The scan reveals an active IPv6 host with port 22 (SSH) open. While
SSH is a common and generally secure protocol when configured correctly,
the absence of detailed service, product, and version information during
the scan limits the ability to assess specific vulnerabilities related
to potentially outdated software or weak configurations. An open SSH
port, without proper hardening and monitoring, can be an entry point for
brute-force attacks or credential stuffing.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the questionnaire and technical scan, the
following risks have been identified. No pre-existing vulnerabilities
were provided in the input data.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and enhance Brimstone Manufacturing’s
cybersecurity posture, the following recommendations are provided:</p>
<h2 id="immediate-actions-high-priority">Immediate Actions (High
Priority)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Systems:</strong> Mandate
Multi-Factor Authentication for all email accounts. This should be a top
priority to protect against credential theft and unauthorized
access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> Extend
MFA requirements to all systems that store or process sensitive
organizational data. This will add a critical layer of security to
high-value assets.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="short-term-actions-medium-priority">Short-Term Actions (Medium
Priority)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a comprehensive AUP that outlines acceptable and
unacceptable use of company IT resources. Ensure all employees read and
acknowledge this policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Annual Security Awareness Training:</strong>
Implement a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all
employees. This training should cover current threats, phishing
recognition, strong password practices, and the importance of reporting
suspicious activities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Harden and Monitor SSH Port (22):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Restrict SSH access to only necessary IP addresses or
networks.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement strong password policies and/or key-based
authentication.</p></li>
<li><p>Disable root login via SSH.</p></li>
<li><p>Change the default SSH port (if feasible and aligns with
operational needs).</p></li>
<li><p>Implement intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) and
monitor logs for suspicious SSH activity.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct a more detailed scan or manual investigation to identify
the exact SSH server version and apply any relevant patches or
configuration hardening.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="long-term-and-continuous-improvement">Long-Term and Continuous
Improvement</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:</strong>
Schedule regular external and internal security audits and penetration
tests to continuously identify and address vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Patch Management Program:</strong> Establish a robust
patch management program to ensure all systems and software are kept
up-to-date with the latest security patches.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Incident Response Plan:</strong> Develop and regularly
test an incident response plan to ensure the organization can
effectively detect, respond to, and recover from security
incidents.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Brimstone Manufacturing has demonstrated some foundational security
controls, such as MFA for computer logins and initial security awareness
training. However, the assessment highlights critical areas requiring
immediate attention, particularly regarding comprehensive MFA
deployment, policy development, and ongoing security education. By
implementing the recommended actions, Brimstone Manufacturing can
significantly enhance its defensive capabilities, reduce its attack
surface, and build a more resilient cybersecurity posture against
evolving threats.</p>
