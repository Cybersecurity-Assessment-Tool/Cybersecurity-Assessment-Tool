<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the current cybersecurity posture of
<strong>Wildfire Communications</strong>, based on a recent network
scan, organizational self-assessment data, and a list of pre-existing
risks.</p>
<p>The technical scan identified no open ports on the target ,
indicating a generally secure external surface based on the scope of the
scan. However, a review of organizational security controls revealed
critical gaps, particularly concerning Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
implementation for computer logins and sensitive data access, and a lack
of security awareness training for new employees. Furthermore, a
pre-existing risk regarding "Unencrypted Web Servers" was identified,
highlighting potential areas for improvement even if the scanned target
did not exhibit this specific vulnerability.</p>
<p>Immediate recommendations focus on addressing these critical gaps by
implementing comprehensive MFA policies, enhancing employee training
programs, and thoroughly reviewing the status of all web servers to
ensure encryption.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-security-control-gaps">Analysis
of Security Control Gaps</h2>
<p>The review highlights critical areas needing immediate attention:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA for Computer Logins:</strong> Lack of MFA for
computer logins significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access
due to compromised credentials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> Absence of MFA
for sensitive data systems poses a high risk to data confidentiality and
integrity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>New Employee Security Training:</strong> Failing to
provide security awareness training for new employees leaves them
vulnerable to social engineering attacks and may lead to inadvertent
security breaches.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on the target using Nmap. The scan was
conducted on 2026-01-26.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="summary-of-findings">Summary of Findings</h2>
<p>The Nmap scan reported that the target host was found to be
<strong>up</strong>. However, no open ports were identified during the
scan. Specifically, port 80 was reported as <strong>closed</strong>.
This indicates that, within the scope of this scan, there are no
immediately exploitable services exposed on the surveyed ports.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To enhance the overall cybersecurity posture of <strong>Wildfire
Communications</strong>, the following recommendations are provided:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for All Computer Logins:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Deploy and enforce Multi-Factor
Authentication for all user accounts logging into organizational
computers and workstations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Significantly reduces the risk of
credential theft and unauthorized access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> High</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Mandate MFA for all access points to
systems containing or processing sensitive organizational data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Provides a critical layer of security
for the most valuable assets, protecting against data breaches.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> Critical</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Mandatory New Employee Security Awareness
Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop and implement a comprehensive
security awareness training program that all new employees must complete
during onboarding.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Equips new hires with the knowledge to
identify and avoid common cyber threats (e.g., phishing, malware),
reducing human error vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> High</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Verify and Mitigate Unencrypted Web Servers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Conduct a thorough inventory of all web
servers within the organization to identify any instances of unencrypted
web services (e.g., HTTP on port 80). For any identified, either close
the port or implement SSL/TLS encryption.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Protects data in transit, prevents
eavesdropping, and enhances user trust.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> Medium</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>While the recent network scan indicated no immediately open ports on
the target , the overall security posture of <strong>Wildfire
Communications</strong> can be significantly improved by addressing the
identified gaps in security controls and pre-existing risks.
Prioritizing the implementation of comprehensive MFA policies and robust
security awareness training for all employees, especially new hires,
will substantially reduce the organization’s attack surface and enhance
its resilience against cyber threats. Continuous monitoring and regular
security assessments are recommended to maintain a strong security
posture.</p>
