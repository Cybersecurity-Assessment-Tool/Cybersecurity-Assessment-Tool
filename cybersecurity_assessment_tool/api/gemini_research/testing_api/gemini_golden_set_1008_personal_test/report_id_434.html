<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p><strong>Apex Legends Group</strong> currently presents a mixed
security posture. While strong controls are in place for Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) across key systems and consistent security
awareness training, several critical vulnerabilities and significant
organizational gaps have been identified. An internal FTP server running
an outdated service allows anonymous access, posing an immediate
high-risk technical threat. Furthermore, the absence of an employee
acceptable use policy represents a significant governance gap, and the
continued use of End-of-Life operating systems (Windows 7) on
workstations introduces widespread vulnerability. Immediate and focused
action is recommended to address these critical findings and bolster the
organization’s overall security posture.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-security-controls">Analysis of
Security Controls</h2>
<p>Apex Legends Group demonstrates strong adherence to best practices
concerning Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across key systems and
consistent security awareness training for employees. This proactive
approach forms a solid foundation for identity and access management.
However, a critical gap exists with the <strong>absence of an employee
acceptable use policy</strong>. This lack of formal guidelines for
employee conduct regarding organizational IT assets and data use exposes
the organization to various risks, including misuse of company
resources, potential data breaches, compliance failures, and legal
liabilities.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed to identify open ports and services on a
target host. The following critical finding was identified:</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="host">Host: </h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Open Port:</strong> 21/tcp</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Service:</strong> FTP</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Product/Version:</strong> vsftpd 2.3.4</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Vulnerability:</strong> Anonymous FTP login
allowed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> This configuration allows unauthorized
users to connect to the FTP server without providing credentials,
potentially granting access to sensitive files, enabling unauthorized
file uploads, or serving as a staging point for further attacks.
Furthermore, the <code>vsftpd 2.3.4</code> version is significantly
outdated (released 2011) and known to have critical vulnerabilities,
including a backdoor (CVE-2011-2523), which severely exacerbates the
risk of compromise and increases the likelihood of a successful
attack.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of organizational data, technical scan results,
and pre-existing vulnerabilities, the following risks have been

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and significantly enhance the
overall cybersecurity posture of Apex Legends Group, the following
actionable recommendations are provided:</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="immediate-actions-critical-high-priority">Immediate Actions
(Critical &amp; High Priority)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>R1: Secure or Decommission FTP Server:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Disable Anonymous Access:</strong> Immediately configure
the FTP server at to disable anonymous login functionality. This is the
most critical first step.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade/Replace Service:</strong> If FTP functionality is
absolutely required, upgrade <code>vsftpd</code> to the latest stable
and secure version. Alternatively, migrate to a more secure file
transfer protocol such as SFTP or FTPS, ensuring strong authentication
(e.g., SSH keys, strong passwords) and encryption are enforced.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Network Isolation:</strong> Implement strict network
segmentation and firewall rules to restrict access to the FTP server
only from authorized internal hosts and services, if it must remain
active.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Vulnerability Scan:</strong> Conduct a comprehensive
vulnerability assessment on the server to identify and remediate any
other potential security weaknesses.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>R2: Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Policy Development:</strong> Draft a comprehensive AUP
that clearly outlines acceptable and unacceptable use of company IT
resources, data, and internet access. The policy should cover topics
such as data handling, privacy, software installation, and appropriate
online behavior.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Communication &amp; Acknowledgment:</strong> Ensure the
AUP is clearly communicated to all employees (both new and existing).
Obtain signed acknowledgments from all staff members to confirm their
understanding and agreement to abide by the policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Integration:</strong> Integrate AUP review and refresher
training into annual security awareness programs.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>R3: Upgrade Workstation Operating Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Phased Upgrade:</strong> Prioritize and execute a phased
plan to upgrade all Windows 7 workstations to a currently supported
operating system (e.g., Windows 10 or 11).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Isolation for Legacy Systems:</strong> For any systems
that cannot be immediately upgraded due to business-critical legacy
applications, implement strict network segmentation and enhanced
monitoring to isolate them from critical assets and the broader
corporate network. Restrict their internet access to only essential
services.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hardware Refresh:</strong> Develop a hardware refresh
plan to replace outdated machines that cannot support modern operating
systems.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="general-best-practices">General Best
Practices</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Policy Review:</strong> Regularly review and update all
security policies and procedures to ensure they remain current and
effective against evolving cyber threats.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Periodic Assessments:</strong> Conduct periodic internal
and external vulnerability assessments and penetration tests to
proactively identify and address security weaknesses across the IT
infrastructure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Patch Management:</strong> Maintain a robust and
automated patch management program for all operating systems,
applications, and network devices to ensure all systems are up-to-date
with the latest security fixes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Security Monitoring:</strong> Implement and continuously
monitor network traffic, system logs, and security events for suspicious
activity, intrusions, and anomalies.</p></li>
