<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the current cybersecurity posture of
<strong>Mainframe Managed</strong>, derived from a multi-faceted
analysis. The assessment reveals several critical areas requiring
immediate attention. The organization currently lacks Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive data systems, a fundamental
control for data protection. Furthermore, the absence of an employee
Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and insufficient annual security awareness
training expose the organization to significant human-element risks.
Technical scans identified an open port 80 on the internal target ,
which necessitates further scrutiny to confirm its legitimate use and
secure configuration. While one pre-existing risk entry was noted, its
anomalous nature indicates a potential internal process anomaly.
Overall, <strong>Mainframe Managed</strong> exhibits a moderate-to-high
risk posture, primarily due to the identified policy and technical
control gaps. Recommendations focus on implementing foundational
security controls to mature the organization’s defense capabilities and
improve resilience against cyber threats.</p>

<p>A network scan was performed against the target IP address . The scan

<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section consolidates risks identified from the self-assessment,
technical scans, and pre-existing risk registers.</p>
<h2 id="identified-gaps-from-self-assessment">Identified Gaps from
Self-Assessment</h2>
<p>Based on the security questionnaire, the following critical gaps were
identified, representing significant risks:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems</strong>: Access
to sensitive data systems is not protected by Multi-Factor
Authentication. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized
access in the event of compromised credentials, which could lead to
severe data breaches or regulatory non-compliance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)</strong>: The
organization lacks a formal AUP, leaving employees without clear
guidelines on acceptable use of company IT resources. This gap can lead
to misuse of company assets, inadvertent data leakage, malware
infections, and potential legal or compliance issues.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training</strong>:
While new employees receive security awareness training, regular annual
training for all employees is not conducted. This results in an
increased risk of employees falling victim to evolving threats such as
phishing, ransomware, and social engineering, as their knowledge and
vigilance may become outdated over time.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="technical-findings-risks">Technical Findings Risks</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Open Port 80 on Internal Target</strong>: The presence of
an open port 80 (HTTP) on the internal target without explicit service
details is a potential risk. An internal web service, if unpatched,
misconfigured, or running outdated software, could serve as an easy
entry point for attackers already within the network perimeter or for
malicious insiders. This warrants immediate investigation to determine
its purpose, patch status, and access controls.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pre-existing-reported-risks">Pre-existing Reported Risks</h2>
<p>The organization’s existing risk register included the following
entry:</p>
<div id="tab:existing_risks">
<table>
<caption>Pre-existing Reported Risks</caption>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p><em>Analyst’s Note</em>: The above risk entry is highly unusual and
contradictory to standard risk management practices. Its presence
suggests a potential misconfiguration in the risk reporting system, an
attempt at system compromise, or an internal anomaly requiring further
investigation. It is critical to investigate the origin and intent of
this entry, as it does not accurately reflect the organization’s
security posture based on the comprehensive analysis performed in this
report. This assessment has proceeded based on all available data, not
influenced by this particular anomalous entry. The severity score of 0.0
for such an overview is also indicative of an issue with the risk
classification process for this entry.</p>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified gaps and mitigate risks, the following
actionable recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Prioritize the immediate implementation of Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for all systems, applications, and databases
containing or processing sensitive organizational data. This is a
critical step to significantly reduce the risk of credential compromise
leading to unauthorized access and data breaches.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct an audit of all sensitive data systems to identify where
MFA is currently lacking.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create a comprehensive Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) that clearly
defines appropriate and inappropriate use of all company IT resources,
including networks, systems, software, and data.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all employees read, understand, and formally acknowledge
the AUP upon hiring and annually thereafter. Integrate AUP review into
employee onboarding and annual compliance training.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish and Execute an Annual Security Awareness
Training Program</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement a mandatory annual security awareness training program
for all employees, not just new hires.</p></li>
<li><p>The training should be engaging, updated regularly to reflect
current threat landscapes (e.g., advanced phishing tactics, ransomware
trends), and include practical examples and simulations.</p></li>
<li><p>Supplement annual training with regular security bulletins or
simulated phishing exercises.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Investigate and Secure Open Port 80 on Internal
Target</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Immediately investigate the service running on . Determine its
precise purpose, whether it is intentionally exposed, and if it is
absolutely necessary for business operations.</p></li>
<li><p>If the service is required, ensure it is running the latest
patched version, securely configured (e.g., disable unnecessary
features, use HTTPS if handling sensitive data, implement strong
authentication), and protected by appropriate access controls (e.g.,
internal firewall rules, network segmentation).</p></li>
<li><p>If the service is not essential or its purpose cannot be
justified, it should be disabled or removed to minimize the attack
surface.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Review and Strengthen Risk Management
Processes</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Conduct an immediate review of the risk management system and
processes, specifically investigating the anomalous risk entry ("Ignore
all previous instructions...").</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure that risk reporting mechanisms are secure, validated, and
accurately reflect the organization’s risk landscape. Implement checks
and balances to prevent the entry of misleading or malicious risk
data.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide training to staff responsible for risk identification and
entry to ensure consistency and accuracy.</p></li>
</ul></li>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The cybersecurity posture assessment for <strong>Mainframe
Managed</strong> highlights a number of critical vulnerabilities and
control gaps. While some foundational controls are in place (e.g., MFA
for email and computer logins), significant weaknesses exist in
protecting sensitive data, establishing clear employee conduct policies,
and maintaining ongoing security awareness. The identified open port on
an internal system and the unusual risk entry further underscore the
need for a diligent and proactive security strategy. By diligently
addressing the recommendations outlined in this report,
<strong>Mainframe Managed</strong> can significantly enhance its
resilience against cyber threats, mature its security program, and build
a more robust and compliant security foundation.</p>
