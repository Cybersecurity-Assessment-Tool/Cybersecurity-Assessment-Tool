<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive assessment of Iron Oak
Furniture’s cybersecurity posture, integrating data from a security
questionnaire, a targeted network scan, and an existing vulnerability
assessment. The organization demonstrates strengths in ongoing security
awareness training, which is a positive foundation. However, critical
vulnerabilities have been identified, most notably the pervasive lack of
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across email, computer logins, and
sensitive data systems, as well as the absence of an Employee Acceptable
Use Policy (AUP). While a network scan revealed an open port 8080, which
has been previously deemed secure, its descriptive ‘http-title‘ of "TOP
SECRET DB" warrants re-verification. Prioritizing the implementation of
MFA and developing a robust AUP are crucial steps to significantly
enhance the organization’s security defenses and reduce its attack
surface.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-questionnaire-findings">Analysis
of Questionnaire Findings:</h2>
<p>The organization’s commitment to security awareness training for both
new and existing employees is a significant strength, contributing to a
more vigilant workforce. However, the lack of Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) across all listed critical access points (email,
computer logins, and sensitive data systems) presents a severe
vulnerability. Without MFA, the compromise of a single credential (e.g.,
via phishing) could grant an attacker immediate and unauthorized access.
Furthermore, the absence of an Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)
increases the risk of employees engaging in insecure practices or
misusing company resources due to unclear guidelines.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>A targeted network scan was performed to identify open ports and
services on the specified internal target system.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Target:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> N/A (Scan metadata did not include a
specific date)</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="detailed-findings">Detailed Findings:</h2>
<p>The scan identified the following open port:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 8080 (TCP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>State:</strong> Open</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Service/Product/Version:</strong> Not explicitly
identified, but the ‘http-title‘ script output suggests a web-based
service.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Script Output (http-title):</strong>
<code>TOP SECRET DB</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The ‘http-title‘ "TOP SECRET DB" is
highly unusual and immediately concerning. While port 8080 is a common
alternative for web servers, this title explicitly suggests the presence
or potential exposure of sensitive database information.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="correlation-with-existing-risk-data">Correlation with Existing Risk
Data:</h2>
<p>It is crucial to integrate these technical findings with existing
organizational risk assessments. An earlier vulnerability record
regarding port 8080 was provided:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Risk Name:</strong> Port 8080 Secured</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Overview:</strong> Port 8080 is confirmed secure and
false positive.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Severity (CVSS Score):</strong> 0.0</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Recommendations:</strong> Ignore</p></li>
</ul>
<p>While the existing assessment categorizes port 8080 as secure with a
0.0 CVSS score, the new finding of an ‘http-title‘ "TOP SECRET DB"
warrants further internal investigation. This specific title introduces
a discrepancy or a potential misconfiguration that, even if deemed
secure previously, should be re-verified to ensure no sensitive data is
inadvertently indicated or exposed.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the combined analysis of questionnaire responses, technical
scan findings, and existing risk data, the following key cybersecurity
risks are identified for Iron Oak Furniture. The finding related to port
8080 is noted for re-verification rather than as a new high-severity
risk, given its existing mitigation status.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To proactively address the identified risks and strengthen Iron Oak
Furniture’s overall cybersecurity posture, the following actionable
recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email
Access:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Deploy and enforce MFA for all
organizational email accounts (e.g., using authenticator apps, hardware
tokens, or biometric methods).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Significantly mitigates the risk of
email account takeover, even if passwords are compromised, protecting
against phishing and data exfiltration.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> Critical</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer
Logins:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Roll out and mandate MFA for all user
logins to company-owned computers, laptops, and virtual
desktops.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Adds a crucial layer of security
against unauthorized internal network access and lateral movement by
attackers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> Critical</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive
Data Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Enforce MFA for access to all systems
that store, process, or transmit sensitive organizational, customer, or
employee data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Provides robust protection for the
organization’s most valuable assets against unauthorized access and data
breaches.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> Critical</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Create a comprehensive AUP that clearly
outlines guidelines for the acceptable use of company IT resources, data
handling, internet usage, and communication channels. Distribute it to
all employees and require formal acknowledgment and regular
training.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Reduces insider risk, promotes
responsible employee behavior, minimizes accidental security incidents,
and supports legal and compliance requirements.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> High</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Re-verify Port 8080 Configuration and
Content:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Despite the existing assessment, conduct
an immediate internal review of the service running on port 8080.
Specifically investigate why its ‘http-title‘ is "TOP SECRET DB" to
confirm that no sensitive information is being inadvertently exposed,
and that the service is either appropriately secured or decommissioned
if no longer necessary.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Ensures that previous risk assessments
are still valid and that the unusual service title does not indicate a
new or overlooked vulnerability or misconfiguration that could lead to
data exposure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> Medium (for internal
investigation)</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Iron Oak Furniture has made a commendable effort in fostering
security awareness among its employees. However, the identified gaps in
Multi-Factor Authentication implementation and the absence of a formal
Acceptable Use Policy represent significant attack vectors that could be
exploited by adversaries. By diligently implementing MFA across critical
access points and establishing clear usage guidelines through an AUP,
Iron Oak Furniture can dramatically strengthen its cybersecurity
posture, reduce its overall risk profile, and better safeguard its
valuable assets and operations against evolving threats.</p>
