<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This document presents a comprehensive cybersecurity assessment
derived from three distinct data sources: a network scan, an
organizational security questionnaire, and a register of existing risks.
The aim is to provide a holistic view of the current security landscape,
identify critical vulnerabilities and control gaps, and propose
actionable recommendations for improvement.</p>

<h1 id="security-control-review-questionnaire-analysis">Security Control
Review: Questionnaire Analysis</h1>
<p>A review of the organizational security questionnaire reveals several
critical areas where security controls are either absent or not fully
implemented. These represent significant risks and attack vectors that
could be exploited.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-questionnaire-gaps">Analysis of
Questionnaire Gaps</h2>
<p>The "No" responses in Table <a href="#tab:security_controls"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="tab:security_controls">1</a>
highlight severe deficiencies in foundational security practices:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Email and Sensitive Systems:</strong>
This is a critical vulnerability. Compromised credentials for email or
sensitive data systems, without MFA, provide attackers direct access to
sensitive information or the ability to launch further attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> Without
an AUP, employees may be unaware of their responsibilities regarding the
use of company IT resources, leading to unintentional data breaches or
policy violations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Security Awareness Training:</strong> The complete
lack of security awareness training (for new and existing employees) is
a significant risk. Employees are often the weakest link in the security
chain, vulnerable to phishing, social engineering, and other
human-factor attacks.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on the target system
<code>192.168.0.5</code>. The scan metadata indicates that the scan date
is unknown, and the target IP is <code>192.168.0.5</code>.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="detailed-scan-findings">Detailed Scan
Findings</h2>
<p>The provided scan data for <code>192.168.0.5</code> yielded minimal
information:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 80 (HTTP):</strong> State:
<code>closed</code></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The provided scan input was very limited,
indicating only one port (80) and its state (closed), with no
information on services, products, or versions. Therefore, a
comprehensive technical vulnerability assessment based solely on this
scan data is not possible. The closed state of port 80 is a positive
finding, as it indicates no direct web server exposure on this specific
port at the time of the scan.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section consolidates risks identified from the security
questionnaire and previously known vulnerabilities, correlating them
with current technical findings where applicable.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="risk-analysis">Risk Analysis</h2>
<p>The most pressing risks stem from the organizational security control
gaps. The lack of MFA for critical systems (email, sensitive data)
leaves the organization highly susceptible to credential-based attacks.
Similarly, the absence of an AUP and regular security awareness training
creates a fertile ground for insider threats (intentional or
unintentional) and successful external social engineering campaigns.</p>
<p>Regarding the "Unencrypted Web Server" risk from Input 3, the current
network scan (Input 1) indicates that Port 80 is closed. This means the
specific immediate threat of an actively exposed, unencrypted web server
is currently mitigated on the scanned target. However, the risk remains
if a web server were to be deployed in the future without proper
encryption (SSL/TLS). Therefore, it’s categorized as a "Potential"
medium risk, emphasizing the need for proactive security measures if
such services are planned.</p>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following recommendations are provided to address the identified
risks and improve the overall cybersecurity posture of <strong>Top
Tier</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="immediate-actions-high-priority">Immediate Actions (High
Priority)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email and Sensitive
Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Enable and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all
employee email accounts.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement MFA for all sensitive data systems and applications.
This significantly reduces the impact of stolen credentials.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create a clear and comprehensive AUP outlining the appropriate
use of company IT resources, data handling, and security
expectations.</p></li>
<li><p>Distribute the AUP to all employees and obtain signed
acknowledgements.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Initiate Security Awareness Training
Program:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement mandatory security awareness training for all new hires
during onboarding.</p></li>
<li><p>Establish a recurring annual security awareness training program
for all existing employees, covering topics like phishing, password
hygiene, data handling, and social engineering.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="long-term-and-continuous-improvement">Long-Term and Continuous
Improvement</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Regular Network and Vulnerability Scanning:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Conduct regular, comprehensive vulnerability scans of all
internal and external network assets to identify open ports, outdated
software, and misconfigurations.</p></li>
<li><p>Prioritize patching and remediation of identified
vulnerabilities.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Secure Web Server Deployment (Proactive):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Should the organization plan to deploy any web servers, ensure
they are configured to use HTTPS with valid SSL/TLS certificates by
default. Avoid exposing HTTP services directly to the internet.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Incident Response Plan Development:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and regularly test an Incident Response Plan (IRP) to
ensure the organization can effectively detect, respond to, and recover
from security incidents.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Data Classification and Access Controls:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Classify organizational data based on sensitivity and implement
strict access controls (Least Privilege) to ensure only authorized
personnel can access sensitive information.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>While the provided technical scan data was limited and showed no
immediate open port vulnerabilities on the specific target, the
assessment reveals critical gaps in <strong>Top Tier</strong>’s
foundational cybersecurity controls. The absence of MFA for key systems,
lack of an AUP, and insufficient security awareness training represent
significant risks that must be addressed immediately. By implementing
the recommended actions, <strong>Top Tier</strong> can significantly
enhance its resilience against common cyber threats and establish a
stronger security posture.</p>
