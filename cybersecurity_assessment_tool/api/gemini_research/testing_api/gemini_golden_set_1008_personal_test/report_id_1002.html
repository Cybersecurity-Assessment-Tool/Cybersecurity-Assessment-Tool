<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for <strong>True Grit</strong>, combining findings from a network scan,
organizational security questionnaire, and pre-existing risk data.</p>
<p>The network scan of the target IP <code>192.168.0.5</code> revealed a
positive security state with <strong>no open ports identified</strong>.
This indicates a well-secured external perimeter for the scanned asset.
However, a significant discrepancy was noted: while a pre-existing risk
highlighted an "Unencrypted Web Server" due to an open Port 80, the
recent scan indicates this port is now closed on the target, suggesting
potential mitigation or an outdated risk assessment.</p>
<p>Conversely, the organizational security questionnaire identified
critical gaps in foundational security controls. Specifically,
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is <strong>not required for email
access</strong>, posing a significant risk for account compromise.
Furthermore, there is <strong>no security awareness training for new
employees</strong>, which can lead to social engineering vulnerabilities
and policy non-compliance from the outset.</p>
<p>Overall, <strong>True Grit</strong> demonstrates strengths in its
network perimeter for the scanned asset but faces considerable internal
and procedural risks related to identity and access management and
employee training. Addressing these gaps is paramount to enhancing the
organization’s overall security posture.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-questionnaire-gaps">Analysis of
Questionnaire Gaps:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Critical Gap: MFA for Email Access (Question
1)</strong><br />
The lack of MFA for email access is a significant vulnerability. Email
is often a primary vector for phishing, business email compromise (BEC),
and serves as a reset mechanism for other accounts. Without MFA, a
compromised password can grant an attacker full access to an employee’s
inbox and potentially to other connected services.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Critical Gap: New Employee Security Awareness Training
(Question 5)</strong><br />
Failing to provide security awareness training for new employees
immediately exposes the organization to risk. New hires may be
unfamiliar with organizational policies, common attack vectors, and best
practices, making them susceptible to social engineering attacks and
unintentional security policy violations.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on the target IP address,
<code>192.168.0.5</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not provided by input data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Summary of Findings:</strong> The scan identified
<strong>no open ports</strong> on the target host
<code>192.168.0.5</code>. The only port evaluated, port 80, was found to
be <strong>closed</strong>. This indicates a well-secured external
network perimeter for this specific asset, at the time of the
scan.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Discrepancy with Pre-existing Risk Data:</strong> It is
important to note a discrepancy between the current scan results and a
pre-existing risk entry ("Unencrypted Web Server"). The pre-existing
risk states "Port 80 is open.", while the recent scan explicitly shows
port 80 as closed on <code>192.168.0.5</code>. This suggests that the
"Unencrypted Web Server" risk may have been mitigated for this target,
or the previous assessment was inaccurate for this specific IP.</p></li>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To improve the overall cybersecurity posture of <strong>True
Grit</strong>, the following recommendations are provided:</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="immediate-actions-high-priority">Immediate
Actions (High Priority)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Access (Addressing
RA1):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Enable and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication for all email
accounts across the organization. This should be a mandatory control for
all users.</p></li>
<li><p>Educate employees on the importance of MFA and how to enroll and
use it.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Mandatory Security Awareness Training for New Employees
(Addressing RA2):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and implement a comprehensive security awareness training
program for all new hires as part of their onboarding process.</p></li>
<li><p>Training should cover topics such as phishing, social
engineering, password best practices, data handling, and organizational
security policies.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="ongoing-actions-and-verification">Ongoing
Actions and Verification</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Verify Status of "Unencrypted Web Server" Risk
(Addressing RA3):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Investigate the discrepancy regarding the "Unencrypted Web
Server" risk. Confirm if port 80 was indeed closed on
<code>192.168.0.5</code> as a result of a specific mitigation
effort.</p></li>
<li><p>If the service was moved or port closed, update the internal risk
register to reflect the current status.</p></li>
<li><p>If other assets within the organization are still running
unencrypted web services on port 80, prioritize their encryption (using
SSL/TLS) or closure.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Security Awareness Training (Reinforcing
Questionnaire Strengths):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Continue the current practice of annual security awareness
training for all employees to reinforce good security habits and update
them on new threats.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Network Scans and Vulnerability
Assessments:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Conduct periodic internal and external vulnerability scans and
penetration tests to identify potential weaknesses and ensure controls
remain effective.</p></li>
</ul></li>
