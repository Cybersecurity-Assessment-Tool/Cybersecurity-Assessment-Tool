<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">1. Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of <strong>Open
Door</strong> based on a review of organizational security controls via
a questionnaire. Due to malformed input, no network scan data or
pre-existing vulnerability records were available for analysis.</p>
<p>The assessment reveals a proactive approach in several key areas,
including multi-factor authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data
systems, an acceptable use policy, and annual security awareness
training. However, critical gaps were identified concerning the lack of
MFA for computer logins and the absence of security awareness training
for new employees. These gaps present significant risks that require
immediate attention. Overall, the organization’s posture is assessed as
<strong>Moderate</strong>, with specific, actionable improvements
recommended to enhance its security maturity.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">6. Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are provided to
address identified gaps and enhance the organization’s cybersecurity
posture:</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="high-priority-recommendations">6.1. High
Priority Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for All Computer Logins:</strong>
Immediately deploy and enforce multi-factor authentication for all user
logins to company computers and endpoints. This significantly reduces
the risk of unauthorized access even if primary credentials are
compromised.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Mandatory New Employee Security Awareness
Training:</strong> Develop and implement a mandatory cybersecurity
awareness training program for all new employees as part of their
onboarding process. This training should cover essential topics such as
phishing, password hygiene, identifying suspicious emails, and
organizational security policies.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="continuous-improvement-recommendations">6.2.
Continuous Improvement Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Regular Policy Review and Update:</strong> Periodically
review and update the employee acceptable use policy to ensure it
remains relevant with evolving technologies and threats.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enhance Existing Training:</strong> Continuously update
the content of the annual security awareness training to include the
latest threat intelligence and real-world examples. Consider specialized
training modules for roles that handle sensitive data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Expand MFA Coverage:</strong> While MFA is used for email
and sensitive data, evaluate the feasibility of extending MFA to other
critical internal systems and applications to create a more robust
authentication posture across the board.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Implementing these recommendations will significantly strengthen Open
Door’s defense mechanisms against common cyber threats and improve its
overall security maturity.</p>
