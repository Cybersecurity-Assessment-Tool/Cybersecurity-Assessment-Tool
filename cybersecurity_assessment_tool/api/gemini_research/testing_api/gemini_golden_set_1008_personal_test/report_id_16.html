<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This document details the cybersecurity posture of Firebrand Media,
based on a multi-faceted analysis. The assessment combines technical
findings from a network scan with insights gathered from the
organization’s self-reported security controls and existing risk
registers. The objective is to identify strengths, weaknesses, and
provide actionable recommendations to bolster the organization’s defense
mechanisms.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are provided to
mitigate identified risks and enhance Firebrand Media’s overall
cybersecurity posture:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create a comprehensive AUP that clearly outlines expectations for
employee behavior concerning company resources, data handling, internet
usage, and device policies.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all employees read, understand, and formally acknowledge
the AUP.</p></li>
<li><p>Integrate the AUP into new employee onboarding and annual review
processes to ensure continuous awareness and compliance.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Mandatory Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement a mandatory security awareness training program for all
new hires during their onboarding process. This training should be
distinct from ongoing annual training.</p></li>
<li><p>The training should cover common threats (phishing, malware),
password best practices, data protection, reporting suspicious activity,
and the organization’s security policies (including the new
AUP).</p></li>
<li><p>Regularly update training content to reflect current threat
landscapes and provide refresher modules as needed.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Maintain Strong MFA Enforcement:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Continue and regularly review the enforcement of MFA across all
critical systems, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data
access.</p></li>
<li><p>Explore extending MFA to any other systems where sensitive data
is accessed or high-privilege operations are performed to further
minimize unauthorized access risks.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Network Monitoring and Scanning:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Although no open ports were found in this specific scan,
implement regular, scheduled network vulnerability scans and penetration
testing for all internet-facing assets and internal infrastructure. This
proactive approach helps identify new exposures as the environment
evolves.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement continuous monitoring of network traffic for anomalous
behavior that could indicate compromise attempts or internal policy
violations.</p></li>
</ul></li>
