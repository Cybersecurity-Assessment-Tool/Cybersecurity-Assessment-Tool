<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">1. Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report outlines the findings of a comprehensive cybersecurity
posture assessment conducted for <strong>Blackwood Industries</strong>.
The assessment integrated an analysis of organizational security
controls, a targeted network scan, and a review of existing risk
data.</p>
<p>A critical vulnerability was identified: an open port 8080 on
<code>10.5.5.5</code> exposing a service cryptically titled "TOP SECRET
DB". This finding directly contradicts an existing risk entry which
previously marked this port as "secured" and a "false positive".
Furthermore, significant security gaps were identified in the
organization’s Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) deployment,
specifically for email access and computer logins, along with the
absence of mandatory annual security awareness training for all
employees. These combined issues present a substantial risk of
unauthorized access, data compromise, and exploitation. Immediate action
is recommended to investigate and secure the exposed service, alongside
implementing robust MFA policies and a comprehensive training
program.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-security-controls">3.1. Analysis
of Security Controls</h2>
<p>The questionnaire responses highlight critical deficiencies in
fundamental security practices:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA Gaps:</strong> The lack of Multi-Factor
Authentication for both email access and computer logins represents a
severe vulnerability. Without MFA, compromised credentials (e.g., via
phishing) can lead directly to unauthorized access to user accounts,
internal systems, and potentially sensitive data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Annual Training Deficit:</strong> While new hires receive
security awareness training, the absence of regular annual training for
all employees means that critical security knowledge may become
outdated, new threats may not be communicated effectively, and overall
security hygiene could degrade over time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Positive Controls:</strong> It is commendable that MFA is
required for sensitive data systems, an acceptable use policy is in
place, and new employees receive initial security training. However,
these positive controls are significantly weakened by the aforementioned
gaps.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">4. Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>A targeted network scan was performed on the client’s internal
target, . The scan aimed to identify open ports and services, revealing
the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target Host:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> N/A (Scan date was not provided in
the input data.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports and Services:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 8080 (TCP):</strong> <em>Open</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Identified Service:</strong> HTTP/Web Server</p></li>
<li><p><strong>HTTP Title:</strong> "TOP SECRET DB"</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-technical-findings">4.1. Analysis
of Technical Findings</h2>
<p>The discovery of an open port 8080 advertising the title "TOP SECRET
DB" is a critical security finding. This strongly suggests that a
sensitive database or application interface is directly exposed,
potentially to internal network users or even to the internet if proper
network segmentation is lacking. Such exposure carries a high risk of
unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or exploitation by attackers.
This finding is particularly concerning as it directly contradicts an
existing risk entry that categorizes port 8080 as "secured" and a "false
positive". The live scan data indicates that a re-evaluation of this
service’s status and security configuration is urgently required.</p>

</ol>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">7. Conclusion</h1>
<p>Blackwood Industries currently faces significant cybersecurity risks
stemming from critical gaps in its foundational security controls and an
exposed sensitive service. While some positive security practices are in
place, the immediate attention to the exposed port 8080, the deployment
of comprehensive MFA, and the establishment of ongoing security
awareness training are paramount. By diligently addressing these
recommendations, Blackwood Industries can substantially strengthen its
defensive posture, reduce its attack surface, and significantly mitigate
the risk of successful cyberattacks.</p>
