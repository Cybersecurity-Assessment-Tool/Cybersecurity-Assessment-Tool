<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides an assessment of the current cybersecurity
posture based on organizational data, a targeted network scan, and
existing risk information. The analysis reveals several critical gaps in
fundamental security controls, primarily identified through the
organizational questionnaire. While the conducted network scan for
<code>192.168.0.5</code> yielded no immediately exploitable open ports,
a pre-existing risk concerning an "Unencrypted Web Server" requires
further investigation to reconcile with the scan findings. The most
pressing issues revolve around the absence of multi-factor
authentication (MFA) across critical access points, a lack of an
employee acceptable use policy, and insufficient annual security
awareness training. Addressing these foundational weaknesses is
paramount to enhancing the overall security posture and reducing the
attack surface.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="identified-critical-gaps">Identified Critical
Gaps:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> MFA
is not required for email access, computer logins, or sensitive data
systems. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access
due to compromised credentials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> The
organization lacks an Employee Acceptable Use Policy, which is crucial
for defining expected employee behavior regarding IT resource usage and
mitigating insider threats.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training:</strong>
While new employees receive training, ongoing annual training for all
employees is not conducted, leading to potential degradation of security
knowledge and best practices over time.</p></li>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="technical-analysis">Technical Analysis:</h2>
<p>The scan results for <code>192.168.0.5</code> indicate that port 80,
typically used for HTTP web traffic, is closed. No other open ports or
identifiable services were found within the scope of this specific scan
data. This is a positive finding, as it suggests that standard web
services are not directly exposed on this particular host. However, the
limited scope of this scan means other potential vulnerabilities may
exist on different ports or services that were not queried, or on other
network assets.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section correlates findings from the questionnaire, technical
scan, and pre-existing risk data to provide a comprehensive view of the
organization’s risk landscape.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="summary-of-identified-risks">Summary of
Identified Risks:</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>High Risk: Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Overview:</strong> Without MFA on email, computers, and
sensitive data systems, the organization is highly vulnerable to
phishing, credential stuffing, and brute-force attacks. A single
compromised password could grant an attacker significant
access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Severity:</strong> Critical</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>High Risk: Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Overview:</strong> Lacking an AUP can lead to
inconsistent or insecure usage of company IT resources, increasing risks
of data breaches, malware infections, and compliance violations due to
undefined employee responsibilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>High Risk: Insufficient Annual Security Awareness
Training</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive training,
the absence of annual refreshers means employees may forget best
practices, become complacent, or fail to keep up with evolving threat
landscapes, making them susceptible to social engineering and other
attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Moderate Risk: Unencrypted Web Server
(Pre-existing)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Risk Name:</strong> Unencrypted Web Server</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization has an existing
record of an "Unencrypted Web Server" where "Port 80 is open." The CVSS
score assigned is 5.0.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Severity:</strong> Moderate (CVSS: 5.0)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Note on Correlation:</strong> It is important to
highlight the discrepancy between this pre-existing risk, which states
"Port 80 is open," and the recent technical scan results (Input 1),
which show port 80 as <code>closed</code> on target
<code>192.168.0.5</code>. This could indicate:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The pre-existing risk refers to a different server not covered by
the recent scan.</p></li>
<li><p>The pre-existing risk has been remediated, and the scan reflects
the current state.</p></li>
<li><p>The scope of the pre-existing risk or the recent scan needs
clarification.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Further investigation is required to reconcile this
information.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and enhance the organization’s
cybersecurity posture, the following recommendations are provided,
categorized by priority.</p>
<h2 id="high-priority-recommendations">High Priority
Recommendations</h2>
<p>These recommendations address critical gaps that pose immediate and
significant risks to the organization.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Immediately enable and enforce MFA for all user accounts
accessing email, logging into computers, and accessing sensitive data
systems. This is the single most effective control against credential
compromise.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider phishing-resistant MFA solutions where
possible.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create a clear and comprehensive AUP outlining employee
responsibilities, permitted and prohibited activities regarding IT
assets, and consequences of non-compliance.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all employees review and acknowledge the AUP
annually.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Annual Security Awareness
Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement a mandatory annual security awareness training program
for all employees, not just new hires.</p></li>
<li><p>Training should cover current threats (e.g., phishing,
ransomware), data handling best practices, and policy
reminders.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="moderate-priority-recommendations">Moderate Priority
Recommendations</h2>
<p>These recommendations address the pre-existing risk and suggest
further investigative steps.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Investigate and Reconcile "Unencrypted Web Server"
Risk:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Conduct an investigation to clarify the "Unencrypted Web Server"
risk (CVSS 5.0).</p></li>
<li><p>Determine if this risk pertains to the scanned target
(<code>192.168.0.5</code>), another internal asset, or an external web
service.</p></li>
<li><p>If the risk is still valid, ensure that all public-facing and
internal web servers use HTTPS/TLS encryption for all traffic (Port 443)
and redirect or close Port 80 to prevent unencrypted
communication.</p></li>
<li><p>If it pertains to <code>192.168.0.5</code> and port 80 is indeed
closed, update the risk register to reflect remediation.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Expand Network Scanning Scope:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Conduct more comprehensive network scans, including a wider range
of ports, deeper service enumeration, and potentially authenticated
scans for internal assets.</p></li>
<li><p>Regular scanning helps identify newly exposed services or
misconfigurations.</p></li>
