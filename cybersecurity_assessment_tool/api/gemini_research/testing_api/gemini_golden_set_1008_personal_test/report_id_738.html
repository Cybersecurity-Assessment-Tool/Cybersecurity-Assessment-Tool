<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of <strong>Catalyst
Consulting</strong> based on an organizational questionnaire, a network
scan of target <code>192.168.0.5</code>, and a review of pre-existing
risk data.</p>
<p>Key findings indicate significant gaps in Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) implementation and security awareness training, which are critical
vulnerabilities. While the network scan did not identify any open ports
on the scanned target, suggesting a reduced external attack surface for
that specific host, the identified internal control weaknesses pose a
substantial risk to the organization’s overall security.</p>
<p>A discrepancy was noted regarding a pre-existing risk: "Unencrypted
Web Server" on Port 80, which stated the port was open. However, the
current network scan indicates Port 80 is presently closed on the
targeted host. This highlights a need for the organization to review and
update its risk register based on current assessment data. Addressing
the identified control gaps and maintaining an accurate risk posture are
paramount for enhancing Catalyst Consulting’s cybersecurity
resilience.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-security-controls">Analysis of Security
Controls</h2>
<p>The questionnaire results reveal significant vulnerabilities in
Catalyst Consulting’s security posture, primarily centered around a lack
of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and inadequate security awareness
training.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA Gaps:</strong> The absence of MFA for email, computer
logins, and sensitive data systems represents a critical vulnerability.
This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access through
compromised credentials, which remains one of the most common attack
vectors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Security Awareness Training Deficiencies:</strong> The
lack of both new employee and annual security awareness training exposes
the organization to social engineering attacks, phishing, and human
error. Employees are often the first line of defense, and without proper
training, they can inadvertently become an organization’s weakest
link.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Acceptable Use Policy:</strong> The presence of an
acceptable use policy is positive, but its effectiveness is diminished
without accompanying training and regular reinforcement.</p></li>

<h2 id="findings">Findings</h2>
<p>The Nmap scan results indicate that no open ports were identified on
the target system <code>192.168.0.5</code>. Specifically, port 80 was
found to be in a <code>closed</code> state. This suggests a relatively
strong external perimeter regarding common service ports for this
particular host, reducing its direct external attack surface. No
specific services, products, or versions could be enumerated as there
were no open ports to investigate.</p>

<h2 id="correlation-and-synthesis">Correlation and Synthesis</h2>
<p>The most significant risks stem from internal control weaknesses
identified through the questionnaire. The complete absence of MFA across
crucial access points (email, computer login, sensitive data systems)
creates an enormous vulnerability to credential-based attacks.
Similarly, the lack of consistent security awareness training leaves the
organization susceptible to human-factor exploitation. These internal
control deficiencies represent a higher immediate risk than any findings
from the external scan.</p>
<p>The technical scan, while positive in its finding of no open ports on
the scanned target, should not overshadow these critical internal
control gaps. The finding that Port 80 is closed on
<code>192.168.0.5</code> directly contradicts the pre-existing risk
"Unencrypted Web Server," which states "Port 80 is open." This
highlights a potential inaccuracy in the organization’s current risk
register or that the pre-existing risk refers to a different asset. It
is crucial for Catalyst Consulting to verify and update its risk
register based on current assessments to ensure an accurate
understanding of its risk posture.</p>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following recommendations are provided to mitigate the identified
risks and improve Catalyst Consulting’s overall cybersecurity
posture:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Priority:</strong> Implement MFA for all email
accounts, especially for administrators and executives, to prevent
unauthorized access via compromised credentials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Critical Systems:</strong> Roll out MFA for all computer
logins (local and network) and sensitive data systems access. Prioritize
systems handling Personally Identifiable Information (PII), financial
data, or intellectual property.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Comprehensive Security Awareness Training
Program:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>New Hires:</strong> Mandate security awareness training
as part of the onboarding process for all new employees, covering
foundational cybersecurity principles.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Annual Training:</strong> Implement mandatory annual
security awareness training for all employees, encompassing topics such
as phishing, social engineering, password hygiene, and data handling
best practices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Continuous Reinforcement:</strong> Conduct regular
simulated phishing exercises to test employee vigilance and reinforce
training concepts throughout the year.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Review and Update Risk Register:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Verification of Discrepancies:</strong> Thoroughly
investigate the discrepancy between the pre-existing "Unencrypted Web
Server" risk and the current scan findings. Determine if the risk refers
to a different asset, if it has been remediated, or if the current scan
did not cover the asset in question.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Process Establishment:</strong> Establish a formal
process for regularly reviewing and updating the organization’s risk
register to ensure it accurately reflects the current threat landscape,
control effectiveness, and asset status.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Enhance Internal Network Visibility (Future
Consideration):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Broader Scanning Scope:</strong> Consider extending
network scans to cover a wider range of internal assets and network
segments to identify any unmanaged or vulnerable systems that may not be
visible from a limited external scan.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Vulnerability Management Program:</strong> Implement a
continuous vulnerability management program to regularly identify,
assess, and remediate vulnerabilities across the entire IT
infrastructure.</p></li>
</ul></li>
