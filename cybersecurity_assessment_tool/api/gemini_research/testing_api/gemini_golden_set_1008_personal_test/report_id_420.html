<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report presents a cybersecurity posture assessment for
<strong>Borealis Tech</strong>. The analysis is based on self-reported
organizational data. Crucially, due to corrupt or incomplete input data,
a planned technical network scan and pre-existing vulnerability
information could not be processed or included in this assessment.</p>
<p>The available data highlights significant and critical gaps in
foundational security controls. Key areas of concern include the
widespread absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across critical
systems (email, computer logins, sensitive data access), a lack of an
employee acceptable use policy, and insufficient annual security
awareness training for all employees. These deficiencies expose
<strong>Borealis Tech</strong> to a range of high-severity risks,
including credential compromise, unauthorized access, data breaches, and
insider threats. Addressing these immediate priorities is vital for
enhancing the organization’s overall security posture.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following details were provided by <strong>Borealis Tech</strong>
regarding their organizational structure and key contact points.</p>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A review of <strong>Borealis Tech</strong>’s self-reported security
controls reveals a concerning number of foundational security practices
that are not adequately implemented. The table below summarizes the
organization’s current stance on key cybersecurity controls.</p>

<p>The prevalence of "No" responses, particularly regarding Multi-Factor
Authentication and ongoing security training, indicates critical
weaknesses in the organization’s defense mechanisms.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>The objective was to conduct a network scan to identify open ports,
running services, and potential vulnerabilities from an external
perspective. However, the provided network scan data
(<code>Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON</code>) was found to be corrupted or
incomplete and could not be successfully parsed or analyzed.</p>
<p>Therefore, this report cannot include specific technical findings
such as open ports, service versions, or directly identified
network-based vulnerabilities.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP</strong>: <code>[Target IP]</code> (Scan data
unavailable)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date</strong>: Data unavailable</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Findings</strong>: No technical scan findings are
available for analysis in this report due to corrupted input
data.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the self-reported organizational data, several high-priority
risks have been identified. It is important to emphasize that this
assessment primarily reflects control gaps from the security
questionnaire, as technical scan data and pre-existing vulnerability
lists were unavailable (due to corrupted
<code>Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON</code>).</p>

<h2 id="correlated-risks">Correlated Risks</h2>
<p>Due to the unavailability of technical scan data and pre-existing
vulnerability information, a comprehensive correlation of risks, which
would typically involve mapping technical findings to business impact
and existing threat intelligence, was not possible for this report. The
identified risks are solely derived from the self-reported control
deficiencies highlighted in the security questionnaire.</p>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the identified risks and control gaps, the following
actionable recommendations are provided to enhance <strong>Borealis
Tech</strong>’s cybersecurity posture. Immediate action on the critical
items is strongly advised.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Across All
Critical Systems (Critical Priority)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Priority</strong>: Deploy MFA for all email
accounts (e.g., via Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, or other email
providers).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Priority</strong>: Implement MFA for all
computer logins, particularly for domain-joined machines and those with
access to sensitive data. Consider solutions like Windows Hello for
Business, third-party MFA providers, or conditional access
policies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Priority</strong>: Extend MFA to all sensitive
data systems and applications, including cloud services, databases, and
critical business applications.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Rationale</em>: MFA is a cornerstone of modern identity and
access management, significantly mitigating the risk of credential theft
and unauthorized access.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement a Comprehensive Acceptable Use
Policy (AUP) (High Priority)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create a clear and comprehensive AUP that outlines employee
responsibilities, permitted uses of company IT assets (hardware,
software, network, data), and prohibited activities.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all employees formally review and acknowledge the AUP,
preferably as part of onboarding and annually thereafter, with signed
confirmations.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Rationale</em>: An AUP establishes clear expectations for
employee conduct, helps manage legal and compliance risks, and fosters a
more secure operational environment.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Enhance and Regularize Security Awareness Training for
All Employees (High Priority)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>While new employee training is commendable, implement mandatory
annual (or more frequent) security awareness training for
<strong>all</strong> employees, not just new hires.</p></li>
<li><p>Training content should be engaging and cover current threats
such as sophisticated phishing, ransomware, social engineering tactics,
strong password practices (supplemented by MFA), data handling best
practices, and clear incident reporting procedures.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct regular simulated phishing exercises to test employee
vigilance and reinforce training concepts.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Rationale</em>: Continuous training is essential to maintain
a strong "human firewall" against evolving cyber threats, reducing the
risk of human error-induced security incidents.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Address Data Inconsistencies for Future
Assessments</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ensure all data inputs for future security assessments are
complete, accurate, and in the expected format to allow for a
comprehensive and accurate analysis. This includes providing complete
network scan data and any existing vulnerability registers.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Rationale</em>: Complete and reliable data is fundamental for
conducting a holistic, effective, and actionable cybersecurity posture
assessment.</p></li>
</ul></li>

<h1 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h1>
<p>This report is based solely on the data provided by the client and
the subsequent analysis conducted. The absence of critical input data,
specifically network scan results and pre-existing vulnerability lists,
significantly limits the scope and completeness of this assessment.
While every effort has been made to identify key risks based on
available information, this report may not encompass all potential
vulnerabilities or threats to <strong>Borealis Tech</strong>. For a more
comprehensive assessment, complete and accurate data inputs are
required.</p>
