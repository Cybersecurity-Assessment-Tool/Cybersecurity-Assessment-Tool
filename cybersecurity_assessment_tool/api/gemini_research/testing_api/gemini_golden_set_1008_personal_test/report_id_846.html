<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report presents a cybersecurity posture assessment for
<strong>Open Door</strong>, integrating data from a recent network scan,
a security control questionnaire, and an inventory of pre-existing
organizational risks.</p>
<p>A notable positive finding from the technical scan is the absence of
any open ports on the scanned internal host <code>192.168.0.5</code>.
This indicates a relatively hardened network perimeter for this specific
asset from a service-level perspective.</p>
<p>However, the assessment identified critical organizational control
gaps. Key areas of concern include the lack of Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems, the absence
of a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), and, most critically,
a complete deficit in structured security awareness training programs
for both new and existing employees. These deficiencies expose the
organization to elevated risks from social engineering, insider threats,
and general human error.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a pre-existing medium-severity risk concerning an
"Unencrypted Web Server" (Port 80) was noted. While the recent scan
showed Port 80 as closed on the target <code>192.168.0.5</code>, this
pre-existing risk warrants a broader investigation across the entire IT
infrastructure to ensure consistent application of secure
configurations. Addressing the identified organizational control
weaknesses is paramount to significantly enhancing <strong>Open
Door</strong>’s overall security posture.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-control-gaps">Analysis of Control Gaps</h2>
<p>The questionnaire responses identify several critical gaps in
foundational security controls:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> The
absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for sensitive data systems is a
significant vulnerability. This increases the likelihood of unauthorized
access to critical information should primary credentials be compromised
through phishing or other attack vectors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Without a formal AUP, employees lack clear guidelines
for the appropriate use of organizational technology, data, and systems.
This can lead to increased risks of misuse, data leakage, and security
policy violations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Security Awareness Training Programs:</strong> The
complete lack of security awareness training for both new and existing
employees is a severe risk. Employees are a primary target for
cybercriminals; without regular training, they are more susceptible to
social engineering, phishing attacks, and unknowingly contributing to
security incidents.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was conducted on an internal host to identify active
services and open ports.</p>
<h2 id="scan-metadata">Scan Metadata</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scanner:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Target Host:</strong> <code>192.168.0.5</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> N/A (Scan date was not provided in
the input metadata.)</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="findings">Findings</h2>
<p>The Nmap scan of the target host <code>192.168.0.5</code> yielded the
following results:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> Up</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports:</strong> No open ports were detected on the
scanned host.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Closed Ports:</strong> Port 80 (HTTP) was explicitly
identified as closed.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="analysis-of-technical-scan">Analysis of Technical Scan</h2>
<p>The finding of no open ports on the internal target
<code>192.168.0.5</code> is a positive security indicator. It suggests
that this specific host has a minimal network attack surface, reducing
opportunities for remote exploitation of services. No outdated software
versions or dangerous configurations were identified, as no services
were found running on open ports.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and enhance the overall
cybersecurity posture of <strong>Open Door</strong>, the following
actionable recommendations are provided:</p>
<h2 id="organizational-control-enhancements">Organizational Control
Enhancements</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Prioritize and deploy Multi-Factor Authentication for all systems
and applications that store, process, or transmit sensitive
organizational data.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure strong MFA methods are used (e.g., hardware tokens,
authenticator apps) and educate users on their importance.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create a comprehensive AUP that clearly defines the acceptable
and unacceptable use of all organizational IT resources, including
networks, systems, software, and data.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all employees read, understand, and formally acknowledge
the AUP, ideally during onboarding and annually thereafter.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish a Mandatory Security Awareness Training
Program:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>For New Employees:</strong> Integrate mandatory security
awareness training as a core component of the onboarding process for all
new hires.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>For All Employees:</strong> Implement annual, mandatory
security awareness training for all existing employees. This training
should cover current threats (e.g., phishing, ransomware), best
practices, and organizational security policies. Consider conducting
quarterly mini-trainings or phishing simulation exercises to reinforce
learning.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="technical-recommendations">Technical Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Investigate Pre-existing "Unencrypted Web Server"
Risk:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>While the recent scan on <code>192.168.0.5</code> showed Port 80
as closed, thoroughly investigate the root cause and current status of
the identified "Unencrypted Web Server" risk across the entire IT
infrastructure.</p></li>
<li><p>Identify any other web servers or services within the network
that might be operating unencrypted HTTP on Port 80.</p></li>
<li><p>Remediate by either closing unnecessary services, reconfiguring
them to use HTTPS with valid SSL/TLS certificates, or ensuring they are
not publicly accessible and handle no sensitive data.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Regular Network Scanning and Vulnerability
Management:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Establish a schedule for regular internal and external network
vulnerability scans to proactively identify open ports,
misconfigurations, outdated software, and other potential
vulnerabilities across all IT assets.</p></li>
<li><p>Integrate scan results into a formal vulnerability management
program to ensure timely remediation.</p></li>
