<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for Orchid Isle, synthesizing data from a network scan, organizational
security questionnaire responses, and an existing risk register. The
analysis reveals several critical gaps and areas for improvement,
primarily concerning Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) implementation
for email access and the absence of a formal Employee Acceptable Use
Policy (AUP). The technical scan did not identify any currently open
ports, presenting a discrepancy with a previously documented risk of an
unencrypted web server. Addressing the identified organizational policy
and control deficiencies will significantly enhance the organization’s
security baseline.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-security-controls">Analysis of
Security Controls</h2>
<p>The organization demonstrates good practices in some areas, such as
requiring MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems, and
conducting regular security awareness training. However, two critical
gaps were identified:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>No MFA for Email Access:</strong> Email is a primary
vector for phishing attacks and account compromise. The lack of MFA
significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to user accounts
and subsequent lateral movement or data exfiltration.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> An AUP
defines the proper use of organizational assets and information, setting
clear expectations for employee conduct regarding cybersecurity. Its
absence can lead to inconsistent security practices and increased
insider risk.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was conducted on the target system. The primary goal
was to identify open ports and services that could expose the
organization to external threats.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Target:</strong> <code>192.168.0.5</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not Available in Provided
Data</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Used:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="detailed-findings">Detailed Findings</h2>
<p>The scan indicated that the target host was <code>up</code>. However,
for the ports scanned in the provided data, only port 80 was explicitly
mentioned and found to be <code>closed</code>. No open ports, services,
or associated product versions were identified in this specific scan
snippet.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="discrepancy-with-prior-risk-data">Discrepancy
with Prior Risk Data</h3>
<p>It is important to note a discrepancy between the current scan
results and an existing risk. The current scan indicates that Port 80 is
<code>closed</code>. This directly contradicts a prior risk entry
("Unencrypted Web Server") which stated "Port 80 is open." This suggests
that the vulnerability may have been remediated, or the current scan
data refers to a different scope or time. Further investigation is
recommended to confirm the status of the previously identified
vulnerability.</p>

</div>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are provided to
enhance Orchid Isle’s cybersecurity posture:</p>
<h2 id="implement-mfa-for-email-access">Implement MFA for Email
Access</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediately implement Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts across the
organization.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Details:</strong> This can typically be configured within
the email service provider’s security settings (e.g., Microsoft 365,
Google Workspace). Enforce MFA for all users, ideally using hardware
tokens, authenticator apps, or biometrics for stronger
protection.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Significantly reduces the risk of email
account compromise, which is a common entry point for
cyberattacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> Critical</p></li>
</ul>
<h2
id="develop-and-implement-an-employee-acceptable-use-policy-aup">Develop
and Implement an Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop, disseminate, and enforce a
comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Details:</strong> The AUP should clearly define rules for
using organizational IT assets (computers, networks, software, email)
and data. It should cover topics like password hygiene, internet
browsing, social media use, handling sensitive information, and
reporting security incidents. All employees should review and
acknowledge the AUP annually.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Establishes clear expectations for
employee conduct, reduces misuse of resources, and mitigates insider
threats.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> High</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="verify-status-of-unencrypted-web-server-risk">Verify Status of
"Unencrypted Web Server" Risk</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Confirm the current status of the
"Unencrypted Web Server" risk, specifically regarding Port 80.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Details:</strong> The current scan indicates Port 80 is
closed, contradicting a prior risk assessment. It is crucial to
determine if the vulnerability has been remediated, if the scan targeted
the correct asset, or if the risk was previously misidentified. If Port
80 is indeed closed and secured, the risk should be retired from the
register. If it’s open on a different asset, it needs to be
re-assessed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Ensures the risk register is accurate
and reflects the current security posture, preventing resources from
being allocated to non-existent issues or overlooking active
ones.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> Medium (for verification)</p></li>
