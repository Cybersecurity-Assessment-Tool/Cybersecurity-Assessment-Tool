<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for Green Sprout Organic, based on an internal network scan, a security
questionnaire, and a review of pre-existing risk data.</p>
<p>The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to fundamental
security practices by widely implementing Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) across email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, as well
as maintaining regular security awareness training. The internal network
scan of <code>192.168.1.100</code> revealed no open network ports,
indicating a minimal direct attack surface from a network
perspective.</p>
<p>However, a critical gap has been identified: the absence of an
employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). This significantly increases
operational and security risks related to employee conduct, data
handling, and system usage. Addressing this policy gap is paramount for
establishing clear expectations and mitigating insider threats or
accidental misuse. No pre-existing vulnerabilities were reported, and
the technical scan did not identify any immediate, exploitable network
services.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<h2 id="network-scan-overview">Network Scan Overview</h2>
<p>An Nmap network scan was performed on an internal host to identify
open ports and services. The metadata for the scan is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>192.168.1.100</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Used:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not provided in scan metadata
(Assumed to be 2026-01-27)</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="detailed-port-scan-findings">Detailed Port Scan Findings</h2>
<p>The Nmap scan against <code>192.168.1.100</code> indicated that no
open ports were detected. All other probed ports were reported as
<code>closed</code> (‘extraports_state: closed‘).</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> Up</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports Found:</strong> None</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Extra Ports State:</strong> Closed</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The absence of open ports on the target
host <code>192.168.1.100</code> is generally a positive finding from a
security perspective, as it minimizes the network attack surface. This
could indicate:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The host is well-hardened with a strict firewall.</p></li>
<li><p>No network services are intentionally running or exposed on this
host.</p></li>
<li><p>The host was inactive or unreachable on the network during the
scan.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>While beneficial for security, it is important to verify if this
state aligns with the intended functionality of the host. If services
were expected, further investigation into network configurations or host
status would be required.</p>

<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Lack of Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP)</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Green Sprout Organic currently lacks an
official Acceptable Use Policy for employees. This leaves the
organization vulnerable to misuse of company resources, inappropriate
data handling, and unclear expectations regarding employee conduct,
potentially leading to security incidents, data breaches, or compliance
violations stemming from internal actions.</td>

Identified (Scan)</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The internal network scan of
<code>192.168.1.100</code> did not reveal any open ports or directly
exploitable network services. This indicates a well-protected network
perimeter on this specific host or that the host is not actively
exposing services. No immediate technical vulnerabilities were found
through this scan.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>No Pre-existing Vulnerabilities
Reported</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">No existing vulnerabilities or known risks
were provided in the current risks data. This suggests either a robust
existing vulnerability management program or that prior assessments have
not identified significant issues.</td>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To enhance Green Sprout Organic’s cybersecurity posture, the
following recommendations are provided, prioritizing the most critical
findings:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement a Comprehensive Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop and formally implement an AUP
that clearly defines the acceptable and unacceptable use of company
information systems, assets, and data by employees.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Details:</strong> The AUP should cover topics such as
internet usage, email, social media, software installation, data
handling, password policies, and personal device usage (if
applicable).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Reduces legal and security risks by
setting clear boundaries for employee behavior, minimizing the
likelihood of accidental data breaches or malicious activities, and
providing a basis for disciplinary action if policies are
violated.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> High</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Verify Network Scan Scope and Target Status:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> While no open ports were found on
<code>192.168.1.100</code>, it is recommended to confirm this aligns
with the expected functionality of the host.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Details:</strong> If services were anticipated to be
running, investigate potential causes for their non-detection (e.g.,
host downtime, firewall rules, incorrect IP address, or scan
limitations).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Ensures that critical services are not
inadvertently hidden or unavailable, and that the perceived security
posture is accurate.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> Medium</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Continue Strong MFA and Security Awareness
Practices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Maintain the current robust
implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all
identified systems (email, computer logins, sensitive data systems) and
continue the established security awareness training program for all
employees (new and annual).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Details:</strong> Regularly review MFA configurations and
training content to keep pace with evolving threats and best
practices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Sustains a strong defense against
common attack vectors like phishing and credential theft, reinforcing a
security-conscious culture.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> Ongoing</p></li>
</ul></li>
