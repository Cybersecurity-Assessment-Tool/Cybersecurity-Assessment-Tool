<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for True North Travel, based on an organizational security questionnaire
and a review of provided network scan data. The analysis highlights
several critical gaps in security controls, particularly concerning
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adoption, the absence of an Employee
Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), and insufficient annual security awareness
training. While no direct technical vulnerabilities were identified from
the provided scan data (as no scans were performed), the identified
policy and control deficiencies represent significant risks to the
organization’s security. Addressing these fundamental areas is paramount
to improving the overall security posture and mitigating potential
threats.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following information was gathered from the organizational data
provided:</p>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A review of the security questionnaire responses reveals the current
state of critical security controls within True North Travel. The
findings are summarized below, with an indication of adherence to best
practices.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>No network scan data was provided for analysis, as the "scans" array
in the input was empty and the target was not specified. Therefore, no
technical vulnerabilities or open ports can be reported from a network
scan perspective at this time. It is highly recommended that regular
vulnerability scanning be performed against the organization’s
external-facing assets (e.g., <code>144.195.88.239</code>) and internal
networks. For the purpose of this report, the target IP for any
potential future scans would be <code>[Target IP]</code>.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the security control review and the absence of other
technical or pre-existing vulnerability data, the following risks have
been identified. The severity is assessed based on the potential impact
and likelihood of exploitation given current industry best
practices.</p>

<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of MFA for Email Access</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Without Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
for email access, accounts are highly susceptible to credential
stuffing, phishing, and brute-force attacks. Compromised email can lead
to business email compromise (BEC), data breaches, and further network
infiltration.</td>

<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of MFA for Computer Login</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The absence of MFA for computer logins
significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to endpoints and
internal network resources if user credentials are stolen or guessed.
This can lead to lateral movement by attackers and data
exfiltration.</td>

<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP)</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Without a formal AUP, employees may not be
aware of appropriate use of company IT resources, leading to increased
risks from shadow IT, data leakage, and compliance violations.</td>

<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Insufficient Annual Security Awareness
Training</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Failing to conduct annual security
awareness training for all employees means the workforce may not be
up-to-date on the latest threats, best practices, and organizational
policies, making them more vulnerable to social engineering and other
attacks.</td>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and enhance the overall cybersecurity
posture of True North Travel, the following recommendations are
provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for All Email
Access:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Deploy and enforce MFA for all employee email accounts without
exception. This is a foundational control against credential
theft.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer
Logins:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement MFA solutions for logging into all company computers,
especially those accessing sensitive data or internal networks. This
adds a crucial layer of security beyond just passwords.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create a clear, concise AUP that outlines the rules for using
company IT resources (computers, networks, internet, email,
software).</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all employees review and sign the AUP upon hiring and
annually thereafter.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Mandatory Annual Security Awareness Training for
All Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and implement a comprehensive security awareness training
program for all employees, conducted at least once per year.</p></li>
<li><p>Training should cover topics such as phishing, social
engineering, password hygiene, data handling, and the importance of the
AUP.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Initiate Regular Network Vulnerability
Scanning:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Conduct regular (e.g., quarterly) vulnerability scans of all
external-facing assets (including <code>144.195.88.239</code>) and
internal network segments.</p></li>
<li><p>Prioritize and remediate identified vulnerabilities based on
severity and potential impact.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>These recommendations, once implemented, will significantly
strengthen True North Travel’s security posture against common attack
vectors and establish a more resilient defense-in-depth strategy.</p>
