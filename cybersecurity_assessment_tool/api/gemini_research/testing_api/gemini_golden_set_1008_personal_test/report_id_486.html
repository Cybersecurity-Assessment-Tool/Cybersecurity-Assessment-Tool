<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of Foresight Strategies
based on an organizational questionnaire, a technical network scan, and
pre-existing risk data. The assessment highlights a strong foundation in
some areas, such as an established acceptable use policy and regular
security awareness training for all employees. However, critical gaps
were identified, notably the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
for computer logins and sensitive data system access, as well as a
missed opportunity for security awareness training for new employees.
The technical scan of an internal host (<code>192.168.0.5</code>) showed
no open ports, indicating a good internal attack surface posture for
that specific host, though one previously identified external risk
related to an unencrypted web server requires further verification.
Addressing the identified MFA and training deficiencies should be
prioritized to enhance the overall security baseline.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-controls">Analysis of Controls</h2>
<p>The review of security controls indicates both strengths and critical
weaknesses:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strengths:</strong> The organization has implemented MFA
for email access, maintains an acceptable use policy, and conducts
annual security awareness training for all employees. These are positive
steps towards a robust security posture.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Critical Gaps:</strong> The absence of MFA for computer
logins and sensitive data system access poses a significant risk, as
compromised credentials could lead to unauthorized access to critical
internal systems and data. Furthermore, neglecting security awareness
training for new employees leaves a window of vulnerability during their
onboarding period.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<h2 id="nmap-scan-details">Nmap Scan Details</h2>
<p>A network scan was performed on the internal target
<code>192.168.0.5</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Target:</strong> <code>192.168.0.5</code> (Internal
Host)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> [Date Unavailable]</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports and Services:</strong> The scan revealed no
open ports on the target host. Specifically, port 80 was found to be
<code>closed</code>. This indicates a minimal attack surface for direct
network-based attacks on this particular system.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="service-and-vulnerability-findings">Service and Vulnerability
Findings</h2>
<p>As no open ports were identified, no services were detected, and
consequently, no immediate service-related vulnerabilities could be
directly identified during this scan.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the questionnaire responses, technical scan
data, and pre-existing risk information, the following risks and gaps
have been identified:</p>

Training</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">New employees are a common target for
social engineering. Lack of initial training makes them more susceptible

<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Unencrypted Web Server</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">A prior assessment identified an
unencrypted web server on port 80. <em>The current internal scan of
<code>192.168.0.5</code> found port 80 to be closed, which might
indicate successful remediation on this specific host or that the risk
pertains to an external service not covered by this scan.</em></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Medium (CVSS 5.0)</td>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To strengthen Foresight Strategies’ cybersecurity posture, the
following recommendations are provided:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer
Logins:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Prioritize the deployment of MFA for all user accounts logging
into organizational computers and network resources.</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluate solutions such as hardware tokens, authenticator apps,
or biometrics.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive
Data Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Extend MFA requirements to all systems that store, process, or
transmit sensitive organizational or customer data.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct an inventory of sensitive data systems to identify all
systems requiring MFA enforcement.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and implement mandatory security awareness training as
part of the onboarding process for all new hires.</p></li>
<li><p>Cover topics such as phishing, password hygiene, social
engineering, and acceptable use policies.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Verify and Mitigate Unencrypted Web Server
Risk:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Investigate the previously identified "Unencrypted Web Server"
risk to determine if it applies to any external-facing systems or other
internal hosts.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all public-facing web services are secured with HTTPS/TLS.
Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS.</p></li>
<li><p>If the risk was indeed remediated on <code>192.168.0.5</code>,
document the remediation details.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Network Scans and Vulnerability
Assessments:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Conduct periodic internal and external network scans to identify
any newly opened ports, services, or misconfigurations.</p></li>
<li><p>Perform regular vulnerability assessments and penetration tests
to proactively identify and address weaknesses.</p></li>
</ul></li>
