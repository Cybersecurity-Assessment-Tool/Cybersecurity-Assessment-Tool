<h1 id="executive-overview">Executive Overview</h1>
<p>This report details the findings from a cybersecurity posture
assessment conducted for <strong>Green Sprout Organic</strong>. The
assessment involved a review of organizational security controls via a
questionnaire, a targeted network scan of an internal host
(<code>10.0.0.15</code>), and an analysis of pre-existing risk
documentation.</p>
<p>The overall security posture reveals several critical and
high-severity risks. Key findings include the presence of an severely
outdated FTP service allowing anonymous access on an internal host,
significant gaps in employee security awareness and policy enforcement,
and the continued use of an End-of-Life operating system across
workstations. Addressing these vulnerabilities and policy deficiencies
is crucial for enhancing the organization’s security resilience against
modern cyber threats.</p>

<h1 id="security-control-review-questionnaire">Security Control Review
(Questionnaire)</h1>
<p>A review of the organization’s reported security practices identified
several areas requiring immediate attention. The table below summarizes
the responses to a critical security questionnaire. A checkmark ()
indicates "Yes" (control implemented), and an x-mark () indicates "No"
(control not implemented or incomplete).</p>

<strong>Status</strong><br />
Do you require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access email?
&amp;<br />
Do you require MFA to log into computers? &amp;<br />
Do you require MFA to access sensitive data systems? &amp;<br />

&amp;<br />
Does your organization do security awareness training for all employees
at least once per year? &amp;<br />
</p>
</div>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-security-control-gaps">Analysis
of Security Control Gaps</h2>
<p>The questionnaire results highlight critical deficiencies in security
policy and employee training:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> Without a
formal AUP, employees may not have clear guidelines regarding the
appropriate use of organizational IT resources, increasing risks related
to data handling, internet usage, and device management.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Insufficient Security Awareness Training:</strong> The
absence of security awareness training for both new and existing
employees significantly elevates the risk of successful social
engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) and general security
missteps. Employees are the first line of defense; untrained personnel
represent a major vulnerability.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on the internal host
<code>10.0.0.15</code>. The scan identified the following open port and
associated services:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Host:</strong> <code>10.0.0.15</code> (Status:
Up)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Port:</strong> 21/tcp</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Service:</strong> ftp</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Product:</strong> vsftpd</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Version:</strong> 2.3.4</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Script Findings:</strong></p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of
Technical Findings</h2>
<p>The findings related to the FTP service pose immediate and severe
security risks:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Outdated FTP Service:</strong> is an extremely old
version of vsftpd (released in 2011) and is known to contain critical
vulnerabilities, including a backdoor vulnerability (CVE-2011-2523).
Running such an outdated and unpatched service dramatically increases
the likelihood of system compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Anonymous FTP Access:</strong> The ability for anonymous
users to log into the FTP service is a critical security
misconfiguration. This allows unauthorized access to files, potentially
leading to data exposure, unauthorized data upload (e.g., malware
distribution points), or system compromise.</p></li>

<code>10.0.0.15</code> is severely outdated (released 2011) and contains
known critical vulnerabilities. &amp; High<br />
Lack of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) &amp; The organization
lacks a formal AUP, leading to unclear expectations for employee
behavior regarding IT resource usage, increasing legal and security
risks. &amp; High<br />
Insufficient Security Awareness Training (New Employees) &amp; New
employees do not receive mandatory security awareness training, leaving
them susceptible to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) and poor
security practices. &amp; High<br />
Insufficient Security Awareness Training (Annual) &amp; The organization
does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees,
leading to a decay in security knowledge and increased susceptibility to
evolving threats. &amp; High<br />
