<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for <strong>Green Sprout Organic</strong>. The assessment involved a
review of organizational security controls through a questionnaire, a
technical network scan, and an analysis of pre-existing organizational
risks. Key findings indicate critical vulnerabilities related to an
outdated and misconfigured FTP service, a significant gap in
multi-factor authentication (MFA) implementation for computer logins,
and the presence of outdated operating systems (Windows 7) within the
environment. Addressing these issues is crucial for enhancing the
organization’s security against modern cyber threats and reducing the
attack surface.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-security-controls">Analysis of Security
Controls</h2>
<p>The organization demonstrates commendable practices in several areas,
including regular security awareness training, establishing an
acceptable use policy, and implementing MFA for email and sensitive data
systems. However, a significant vulnerability is identified in the lack
of multi-factor authentication for computer logins. This absence
substantially increases the risk of unauthorized access to internal
systems should user credentials be compromised through phishing,
malware, or other means.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>

</div>
<h3 id="detailed-analysis-of-ftp-service-port-21">Detailed Analysis of
FTP Service (Port 21)</h3>
<p>The Nmap scan identified an FTP service running <code>vsftpd</code>
version <code>2.3.4</code> on TCP port 21. Further investigation
revealed severe security deficiencies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Outdated Version:</strong> vsftpd 2.3.4 was released in
2011 and is considered End-of-Life (EOL). This version is notoriously
vulnerable, specifically to a critical backdoor (CVE-2011-2523) that
allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands with root
privileges. This represents an immediate and critical compromise
risk.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Anonymous FTP Login Allowed:</strong> The service is
configured to permit anonymous FTP logins. This misconfiguration can
lead to unauthorized access, potentially allowing attackers to read,
write, or execute files on the server, depending on the permissions
granted to anonymous users. This significantly increases the attack
surface.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This combination of an outdated, critically vulnerable software
version and an insecure configuration constitutes a critical security
flaw, posing an extreme risk of system compromise.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section consolidates all identified risks, combining gaps from
the security questionnaire, critical findings from the technical scan,
and pre-existing organizational vulnerabilities.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the comprehensive assessment, the following actionable
recommendations are provided to significantly strengthen the
cybersecurity posture of <strong>Green Sprout Organic</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="high-priority-recommendations">High-Priority
Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Remediate Outdated and Vulnerable FTP
Service:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Action:</strong> Disable anonymous FTP login on
the server identified at <code>10.0.0.15</code> (and any other similarly
configured hosts) immediately.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Short-Term:</strong> Evaluate the necessity of an FTP
service. If absolutely required, migrate from FTP to a secure file
transfer protocol such as SFTP or FTPS. If FTP must remain, upgrade
vsftpd to a currently supported and patched version or deploy a secure
alternative FTP server.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Long-Term:</strong> Implement a robust patch management
program for all network services and conduct regular vulnerability scans
and penetration tests to identify and remediate similar exposures
proactively. Review all publicly accessible services to ensure they are
strictly necessary, securely configured, and regularly updated.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Logins:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Action:</strong> Prioritize the implementation
of multi-factor authentication for all administrative accounts logging
into computers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Short-Term:</strong> Roll out MFA for all user accounts
accessing company computers and systems. Integrate MFA solutions with
existing identity management infrastructure (e.g., Active Directory)
where feasible.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Long-Term:</strong> Establish a comprehensive Identity
and Access Management (IAM) framework that mandates strong
authentication, least privilege access, and regular access reviews
across all critical systems and data stores.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="medium-priority-recommendations">Medium-Priority
Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Address Outdated Windows Operating Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Action:</strong> Initiate a phased upgrade
project to migrate all Windows 7 machines to a currently supported
operating system, such as Windows 10 or Windows 11.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Short-Term:</strong> For any Windows 7 machines that
cannot be immediately upgraded, implement stringent network segmentation
to isolate them from critical network segments. Deploy advanced endpoint
detection and response (EDR) solutions to monitor and protect these
legacy systems as much as possible.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Long-Term:</strong> Implement a proactive operating
system lifecycle management strategy to ensure that all endpoints run
supported software. Establish a consistent patch management schedule and
ensure hardware is refreshed to support modern operating systems and
security features.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p><strong>Green Sprout Organic</strong> has demonstrated a foundational
commitment to cybersecurity through security awareness training and
acceptable use policies. However, the identified critical
vulnerabilities concerning the outdated and misconfigured FTP service,
the absence of MFA for computer logins, and the continued use of
End-of-Life operating systems present significant and immediate risks to
the organization’s security posture. By prioritizing and diligently
implementing the recommendations detailed in this report, <strong>Green
Sprout Organic</strong> can substantially enhance its resilience against
cyber threats, reduce its overall attack surface, and protect its
valuable assets more effectively.</p>
