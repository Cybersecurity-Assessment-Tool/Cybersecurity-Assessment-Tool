<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive assessment of ’s cybersecurity
posture, drawing insights from a detailed security questionnaire, a
targeted network scan, and an analysis of pre-existing risk data.</p>
<p>The organization demonstrates positive security practices in several
key areas, including the mandatory use of Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) for email access and sensitive data systems, the presence of an
employee acceptable use policy, and initial security awareness training
for new hires. These controls form a foundational layer of defense.</p>
<p>However, critical gaps have been identified that require immediate
attention. Notably, the absence of mandatory MFA for logging into
computers poses a significant risk of unauthorized access through
compromised credentials. Furthermore, the lack of regular, annual
security awareness training for all employees leaves the workforce
susceptible to evolving social engineering tactics and general human
error over time.</p>
<p>The network scan of target revealed no open ports, which is a
positive indicator for minimizing the external network attack surface
for that specific host. No pre-existing vulnerabilities were provided
for analysis.</p>
<p>Addressing the identified risks, particularly the implementation of
MFA for computer logins and a robust program for continuous employee
security education, is paramount for significantly enhancing ’s overall
cybersecurity resilience.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following organizational details were provided for this

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A security questionnaire was completed to assess various aspects of
the organization’s security controls and policies. The findings are
summarized below:</p>

Do you require MFA to access email? &amp; Yes &amp;<br />
Do you require MFA to log into computers? &amp; No &amp;<br />
Do you require MFA to access sensitive data systems? &amp; Yes
&amp;<br />

&amp; Yes &amp;<br />
Does your organization do security awareness training for all employees
at least once per year? &amp; No &amp;<br />

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was conducted on the target host .</p>
<p>The scan reported that no open ports were detected on this host. This
indicates a minimal network attack surface for from the perspective of
the scan. Consequently, no services, product versions, or potential
vulnerabilities directly attributable to open network ports were
identified during this assessment.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the security questionnaire and technical
scan, the following risks have been identified:</p>

C<span>0.1</span></span> <strong>Risk ID</strong> &amp; <strong>Risk
Name</strong> &amp; <strong>Overview</strong> &amp;
<strong>Severity</strong><br />
R-001 &amp; Inadequate Multi-Factor Authentication for Computer Logins
&amp; The organization does not require MFA for logging into computers.
This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access through
compromised credentials (e.g., phishing, brute-force attacks),
potentially leading to data breaches or system compromise. &amp;
High<br />
R-002 &amp; Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training &amp; While
new employees receive initial training, the absence of mandatory annual
security awareness training for all employees leaves the workforce
vulnerable to evolving threats. Employees may become complacent or
unaware of new attack vectors (e.g., advanced phishing, ransomware
tactics), increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security
incidents. &amp; Medium<br />

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="pre-existing-vulnerabilities">Pre-existing
Vulnerabilities</h2>
<p>No pre-existing vulnerabilities were provided in the input data for
this assessment.</p>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and enhance ’s overall cybersecurity
posture, the following recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
Computer Logins:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Make MFA mandatory for all employee computer logins, in addition
to email and sensitive data systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluate and deploy an MFA solution that integrates seamlessly
with existing identity management systems (e.g., Active Directory, cloud
identity providers).</p></li>
<li><p>Provide clear instructions and support to employees during the
rollout phase to ensure high adoption rates and minimal
disruption.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish and Enforce Annual Security Awareness
Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and implement a comprehensive program for mandatory
annual security awareness training for all employees, not just new
hires.</p></li>
<li><p>The training content should be updated regularly to cover current
cybersecurity threats, attack techniques (e.g., advanced phishing,
social engineering, ransomware), and organizational security
policies.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider incorporating interactive modules, simulated phishing
exercises, and regular refreshers to reinforce learning.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Network Security Review and Audits:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>While the current scan for showed no open ports, it is good
practice to regularly review and audit network configurations, firewall
rules, and perimeter defenses.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure that only strictly necessary ports and services are
exposed, and unnecessary services are disabled or properly
secured.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to
monitor network traffic for suspicious activity.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>These recommendations, if implemented diligently, will significantly
strengthen ’s defenses against common attack vectors and foster a more
robust security culture.</p>
