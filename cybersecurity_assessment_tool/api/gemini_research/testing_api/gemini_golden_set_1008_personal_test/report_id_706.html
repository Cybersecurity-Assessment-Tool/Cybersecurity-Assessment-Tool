<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This cybersecurity posture assessment for <strong>Tidal Wave
Sports</strong> reveals a foundational commitment to security,
particularly in implementing MFA for sensitive systems and computers,
and establishing an acceptable use policy. Initial security awareness
training for new employees is a positive step. However, two significant
vulnerabilities were identified through the organizational
questionnaire: the absence of MFA for email access and the lack of
annual, recurring security awareness training for all staff. Both areas
represent high-priority risks that could lead to unauthorized access,
phishing attacks, and a general weakening of the human firewall. The
absence of network scan data means no external attack surface analysis
could be performed, and no pre-existing vulnerabilities were reported.
Recommendations focus on addressing the identified control gaps to
bolster the organization’s defenses against common cyber threats.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and enhance the overall cybersecurity
posture of <strong>Tidal Wave Sports</strong>, the following
recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Access:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediately enable and enforce
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all organizational email accounts.
This should include all users, including administrative and privileged
accounts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Email is a primary vector for
cyberattacks (e.g., phishing, BEC). MFA significantly reduces the risk
of account compromise even if passwords are stolen or weak.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> Critical</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Annual Security Awareness Training for All
Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop and implement a mandatory annual
(or more frequent) security awareness training program for all
employees, not just new hires. This training should cover current
threats such as phishing, social engineering, ransomware, and proper
data handling.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rationale:</strong> The threat landscape is constantly
evolving. Regular training ensures that all employees are up-to-date on
best practices and emerging threats, strengthening the human
firewall.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> High</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Regular External Network Scans:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Engage in regular external vulnerability
scanning and penetration testing of your public-facing IP addresses and
infrastructure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Without scan data, the external
attack surface remains unknown. Regular scans can identify open ports,
vulnerable services, and misconfigurations that attackers could
exploit.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> Medium (for future planning)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Maintain a Vulnerability Management Program:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Implement a formal vulnerability
management program to identify, assess, prioritize, and remediate
security vulnerabilities across all systems and applications. This
includes keeping track of discovered vulnerabilities, even if initially
none were provided.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Proactive vulnerability management is
crucial for maintaining a strong security posture and reducing the
likelihood of successful attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> Medium (for future planning)</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h1>
<p>This report is based solely on the data provided at the time of
analysis. The absence of specific technical scan data and pre-existing
vulnerability information limits the scope of this assessment. A
complete cybersecurity posture assessment would require comprehensive
technical scans, internal audits, and further discussions with relevant
stakeholders.</p>
