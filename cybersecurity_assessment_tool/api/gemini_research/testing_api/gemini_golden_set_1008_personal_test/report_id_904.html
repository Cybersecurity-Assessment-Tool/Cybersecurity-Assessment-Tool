<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of Golden Gate Gaming,
based on an analysis of provided organizational data, a targeted network
scan, and an assessment of current risks. While the scanned internal
host <code>192.168.1.100</code> demonstrates strong network-level
hardening with no open ports identified, significant foundational
security gaps exist. Key areas of concern include the lack of
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer login, and the
absence of dedicated security awareness training for new employees.
These deficiencies expose the organization to elevated risks of
unauthorized access and successful social engineering attacks.
Recommendations provided aim to address these critical findings and
enhance the overall security posture.</p>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A review of the organization’s self-assessed security controls was
conducted through a questionnaire. The findings are summarized

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on the internal host
<code>192.168.1.100</code>. The scan, conducted on 2026-01-27, indicated
that the target host was responsive ("up").</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="nmap-scan-summary">Nmap Scan Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target Host:</strong> <code>192.168.1.100</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> Up</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports and Services:</strong> No open ports or active
services were identified during this scan. The "extraports_state" was
reported as "closed," indicating that common ports were scanned and
found to be unresponsive.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This finding is positive as it suggests a well-hardened system at the
network layer or an effective host-based firewall configuration,
reducing the attack surface from network-based probes. However, it is
important to note that this specific scan focused on a single internal
IP, and a broader assessment might be required for a complete picture of
the network’s exposure.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and enhance the overall
cybersecurity posture of Golden Gate Gaming, the following
recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
Email:</strong> Mandate MFA for all email accounts across the
organization. This is a critical control to prevent unauthorized access
even if passwords are stolen, significantly reducing the risk of
phishing and BEC attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer
Login:</strong> Deploy MFA solutions for all workstation and server
logins. This adds a crucial layer of security, protecting against
compromised credentials and preventing unauthorized access to internal
systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Mandatory Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong> Integrate comprehensive security awareness training
into the onboarding process for all new hires. This ensures employees
are aware of common threats, organizational policies, and best practices
from day one, fostering a security-conscious culture.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Broader Internal Network Scan:</strong> Perform
more extensive internal network scans across different subnets and
critical assets to identify potential vulnerabilities, open ports, or
misconfigurations not covered by this focused scan. This will provide a
more comprehensive view of the internal network’s security
posture.</p></li>
