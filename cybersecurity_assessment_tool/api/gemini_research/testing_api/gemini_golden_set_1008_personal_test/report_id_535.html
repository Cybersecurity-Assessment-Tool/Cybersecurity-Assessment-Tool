<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for <strong>Cinder &amp; Ash</strong>, based on an analysis of network
scan data, organizational security questionnaire responses, and reported
pre-existing risks. The current security posture is assessed as
<strong>Fair</strong>, exhibiting critical gaps primarily in
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) implementation and potential exposure
from an open network service.</p>
<p>Key findings include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Significant MFA Gaps:</strong> Multi-Factor
Authentication is not required for computer logins or access to
sensitive data systems, leaving the organization vulnerable to
credential-based attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Network Service:</strong> An SSH service (port 22)
is identified as open on the target system. While not inherently a
vulnerability, its exposure without detailed service information or
hardening practices presents a potential attack vector.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Positive Security Practices:</strong> The organization
demonstrates good practices in security awareness training and
acceptable use policy implementation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Reported Pre-existing Risks:</strong> No pre-existing
vulnerabilities or risks were reported in the provided data.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Immediate recommendations focus on implementing robust MFA across
critical access points, hardening exposed network services, and
conducting further technical assessments to identify specific service
versions and potential exploits.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-questionnaire-findings">Analysis of Questionnaire
Findings</h2>
<p>The questionnaire responses indicate a mixed security posture
regarding internal controls. While the organization maintains strong
security awareness training programs and an acceptable use policy,
significant gaps exist in the implementation of Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA):</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA for Computer Logins:</strong> The lack of MFA for
logging into computers is a critical vulnerability. This significantly
increases the risk of unauthorized access if user credentials are stolen
or guessed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> Similarly, the
absence of MFA for accessing sensitive data systems exposes critical
information to potential compromise should credentials for these systems
be breached.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These MFA deficiencies represent high-priority risks that require
immediate attention.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>This section details the findings from the network scan performed
against the client’s infrastructure.</p>
<h2 id="nmap-scan-findings">Nmap Scan Findings</h2>
<p>A network scan was conducted on the target IPv6 address .</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> N/A (not provided in
metadata)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Status:</strong> Host is reported as ’up’.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="open-ports">Open Ports</h3>
<p>The following open port was identified:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 22/tcp:</strong> State: open. This port is commonly
associated with the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol. No specific service
name, product, or version information was obtained during this
scan.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="technical-analysis">Technical Analysis</h3>
<p>The presence of an open SSH port (22/tcp) indicates that the target
system is likely configured to allow remote administrative access.
Without specific service version information, it is impossible to
determine if the SSH server is running an outdated or vulnerable
version. However, any internet-facing SSH service is a common target for
brute-force attacks, dictionary attacks, and exploitation attempts if
misconfigured or running vulnerable software.</p>
<p>Key considerations for this finding:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Exposure:</strong> The service is directly accessible,
posing a potential entry point for attackers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Detail:</strong> The absence of service version
information prevents assessment of known vulnerabilities (CVEs) directly
linked to the software. Further investigation is required.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Security Best Practices:</strong> SSH services should be
rigorously hardened, including using strong, complex passwords (or
preferably SSH keys), disabling root login, restricting access to known
source IPs, and ensuring the software is regularly patched and
updated.</p></li>

technical scans into a consolidated view of identified risks and their
associated severities.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Cinder &amp; Ash currently faces identifiable cybersecurity risks,
particularly concerning the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for
critical access points and the exposure of an SSH service. While the
organization exhibits strengths in security awareness, addressing the
identified high-priority gaps is crucial for enhancing its overall
resilience against modern cyber threats. Implementing the recommended
actions will significantly strengthen the organization’s security
posture and reduce its attack surface.</p>
