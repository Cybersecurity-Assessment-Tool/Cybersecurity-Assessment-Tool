<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive assessment of the cybersecurity
posture for <strong>Golden Gate Gaming</strong>. The analysis is derived
from organizational data, responses to a security control questionnaire,
and technical network scan results.</p>
<p>The assessment highlights several areas of strength, notably the
requirement for Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access email and
consistent security awareness training for employees. However, critical
security gaps were identified that warrant immediate attention. These
include the absence of MFA for computer logins and access to sensitive
data systems, as well as the lack of a formal Employee Acceptable Use
Policy (AUP). The network scan of the target did not identify any open
ports, which is a positive indicator for external exposure, but
comprehensive and regular scanning remains crucial. Addressing the
identified high and critical risks is paramount to bolster
<strong>Golden Gate Gaming</strong>’s overall security resilience and
reduce its attack surface.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed using Nmap on the specified target. The
objective was to identify open ports, active services, and potential
vulnerabilities.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Target:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not available in input data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> Up (The target host was responsive
to network requests during the scan.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports and Services:</strong> No open ports were
identified on the target system within the scope of this scan. All
probed ports were reported as closed, indicating that no network
services were overtly exposed or detected on standard ports.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: The absence of identified open ports is generally a
positive indicator for network hardening. However, this finding should
be considered within the context of the scan’s scope (e.g., specific
port ranges, firewall rules, internal vs. external perspective). It does
not definitively rule out vulnerabilities in applications running on the
system, services operating on non-standard ports, or potential internal
network exposures. Regular, comprehensive scanning and internal security
assessments are crucial for a complete picture.</em></p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the organizational data, security
questionnaire responses, and technical scan results, the following risks
have been identified. No pre-existing vulnerabilities were provided in

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To effectively mitigate the identified risks and strengthen the
overall cybersecurity posture of <strong>Golden Gate Gaming</strong>,
the following actionable recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Logins:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mandate the use of Multi-Factor Authentication for all user
logins to company computers, workstations, and network devices.</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluate and deploy appropriate MFA solutions, such as hardware
tokens, biometric authentication, or mobile authenticator applications,
integrated with existing login processes.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication for all access points to
systems, applications, and databases that store, process, or transmit
sensitive organizational or customer data.</p></li>
<li><p>Prioritize implementation for systems based on data
classification, criticality, and potential impact of
compromise.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) that
clearly defines expectations for appropriate use of all company IT
resources, including internet, email, software, and data
handling.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all employees read, understand, and formally acknowledge
the AUP. Integrate AUP review and training into new employee onboarding
and annual security awareness training.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Regular, Comprehensive Network
Scans:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>While the initial scan indicated no open ports, it is crucial to
conduct periodic, more in-depth network vulnerability scans (both
external and internal) using various tools.</p></li>
<li><p>Expand scanning efforts to cover a broader range of ports,
protocols, and include authenticated scans where feasible, to identify
potential misconfigurations, shadow IT, and vulnerable
services.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Review Network Architecture and Firewall
Rules:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Perform a comprehensive review of the current network
architecture, including network segmentation, firewall rules, and
intrusion detection/prevention systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure that only absolutely necessary ports are open and services
exposed, strictly adhering to the principle of least privilege and
defense-in-depth strategies.</p></li>
</ul></li>
