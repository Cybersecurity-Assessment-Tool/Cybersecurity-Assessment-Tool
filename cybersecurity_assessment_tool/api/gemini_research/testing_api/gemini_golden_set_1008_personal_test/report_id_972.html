<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">1. Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report summarizes a cybersecurity posture assessment for
<strong>Skyward Bound</strong>. Based on the provided organizational
data, several critical gaps in security controls related to multi-factor
authentication (MFA) and recurring security awareness training have been
identified. Unfortunately, comprehensive technical scan data and
pre-existing risk information were unavailable for analysis due to
malformed input. This significantly limits a complete technical risk
analysis. However, the identified control deficiencies represent
significant, immediate risks to the organization’s security posture that
require urgent attention. Key recommendations include the immediate
implementation of MFA across critical systems and the establishment of a
robust, recurring security awareness training program.</p>

Analysis of Questionnaire Findings</h2>
<p>The review highlights critical deficiencies in foundational security
practices. The lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email
access and computer logins significantly increases the risk of
unauthorized access and account compromise, as stolen or guessed
credentials would be sufficient for entry. While MFA is used for
sensitive data systems, the broader omission creates vulnerable entry
points. Furthermore, the absence of annual security awareness training
for all employees means the workforce may not be adequately prepared to
identify and resist evolving social engineering threats, phishing
attempts, and other common attack vectors.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">4. Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>No network scan data was available for analysis due to the provided
‘Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON‘ being malformed or incomplete, specifically
marked as ‘[BROKEN]‘.</p>
<p>Therefore, no technical vulnerabilities related to open ports,
running services, or specific software versions could be identified or
assessed in this report. It is strongly recommended to conduct a
comprehensive network vulnerability scan against
<code>[Target IP]</code> as soon as possible to identify potential
exposure points and misconfigurations that could be exploited by
attackers.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment">5. Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This risk assessment focuses primarily on the identified gaps from
the security control questionnaire, as technical scan data and
pre-existing risk data were unavailable for comprehensive analysis. The
‘Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON‘ was also indicated as ‘[BROKEN]‘.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">6. Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are provided to
improve Skyward Bound’s cybersecurity posture:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Access</strong>: Immediately
deploy and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication for all employee email
accounts. This significantly reduces the risk of account compromise even
if passwords are stolen.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Logins</strong>: Extend MFA
requirements to all computer login processes, particularly for
domain-joined machines and critical servers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Annual Security Awareness Training</strong>:
Develop and implement a mandatory, annual security awareness training
program for all employees. This training should cover common threats
such as phishing, social engineering, malware, and safe browsing
practices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Comprehensive Network Scan</strong>: Arrange for
a complete and professional network vulnerability scan of all external
and internal assets. This will identify open ports, vulnerable services,
and outdated software versions that were unable to be assessed in this
report.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Review and Document Pre-existing Risks</strong>: Conduct
a thorough review of any internal risk registers or vulnerability
management systems to identify and prioritize pre-existing risks not
covered in this report.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop Incident Response Plan</strong>: Ensure an
up-to-date and tested incident response plan is in place to effectively
manage and mitigate the impact of any security incidents.</p></li>
