<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">1. Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for Crestview Analytics, synthesizing data from a network scan,
responses to a security questionnaire, and an existing risk register.
The analysis reveals a generally positive stance on security awareness
and policy enforcement, with several key controls in place. However, two
critical areas require immediate attention: the absence of Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for computer logins, which represents a significant
vulnerability to credential-based attacks, and the discovery of an
openly accessible service on port <code>8080</code> identifying as a
"TOP SECRET DB." This latter finding directly contradicts an existing
entry in the organization’s risk register, which marked this port as
secured, indicating a potential critical oversight or outdated
assessment. Addressing these findings is paramount to strengthening the
overall security posture.</p>

Analysis of Questionnaire Findings</h2>
<p>Crestview Analytics demonstrates a strong commitment to several
foundational security practices, including the use of MFA for email and
sensitive data systems, an acceptable use policy, and comprehensive
security awareness training.</p>
<p>However, a significant gap identified is the lack of Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. This omission dramatically
increases the risk of unauthorized access to internal systems should an
employee’s credentials be compromised. Implementing MFA for all computer
logins is a critical security enhancement.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">4. Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="network-scan-overview">4.1. Network Scan
Overview</h2>
<p>A network scan was conducted on the client’s internal IP address,
<code>10.5.5.5</code>. The scan aimed to identify open ports and
services that could pose potential security risks.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="detailed-findings">4.2. Detailed
Findings</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP:</strong> <code>10.5.5.5</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not explicitly available in scan
metadata.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Port:</strong> <code>8080</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Service/Script Output:</strong>
<code>http-title: TOP SECRET DB</code></p></li>
</ul>
<p>The network scan identified an open port <code>8080</code> on the
target system. This port is hosting a service that, according to its
HTTP title, is named "TOP SECRET DB." The presence of such a title
strongly suggests that highly sensitive information may be exposed or
accessible via this service. This finding is of critical concern.</p>
<p>Notably, this finding appears to directly contradict an entry in
Crestview Analytics’ existing risk register, which describes "Port 8080
Secured" with a severity of 0.0, indicating it was previously assessed
as a false positive or secured asset. The current scan data suggests
this assessment is outdated or inaccurate, requiring immediate
re-evaluation.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment">5. Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the security questionnaire and the technical
scan results, the following key risks have been identified:</p>

Existing Risk Register Correlation</h2>
<p>The existing risk register contained an entry for "Port 8080 Secured"
with a severity of 0.0, indicating it was deemed a false positive or
adequately secured. The current network scan’s discovery of an active
service with the HTTP title "TOP SECRET DB" on this very port highlights
a critical discrepancy. This suggests either a recent change in the
service configuration, a misconfigured asset that was overlooked, or an
inaccurate initial risk assessment. The implication is that the
organization’s understanding of this specific asset’s security posture
is flawed, potentially leaving sensitive data exposed.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">6. Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and enhance Crestview Analytics’
cybersecurity posture, the following recommendations are provided:</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="immediate-actions">6.1. Immediate
Actions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Logins (High
Priority):</strong> Mandate and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication for
all computer logins across the organization. This is a fundamental
security control that significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Investigation of Port 8080 (Critical
Priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Immediately investigate the service running on port
<code>8080</code> on <code>10.5.5.5</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Determine the true nature of the data/application it hosts and
its sensitivity level.</p></li>
<li><p>Assess whether this service should be network-accessible,
particularly from external networks (if applicable).</p></li>
<li><p>If the service is not intended for public exposure, restrict
network access immediately (e.g., firewall rules, internal-only
access).</p></li>
<li><p>If the data is truly "TOP SECRET," ensure it resides on
adequately protected systems with robust access controls, encryption,
and monitoring.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="long-term-strategies">6.2. Long-Term
Strategies</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Review and Update Risk Management Process:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Conduct a comprehensive review of the organization’s risk
assessment and management procedures to ensure that existing risks are
regularly re-validated against current infrastructure states.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement a formal process for periodic re-scans and
re-assessments of critical assets.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure that any "false positive" designations are rigorously
documented and verified.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Vulnerability Scans and Penetration
Testing:</strong> Conduct frequent, authenticated vulnerability scans
and periodic penetration tests against both internal and external assets
to proactively identify and address security weaknesses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Asset Inventory and Management:</strong> Maintain an
up-to-date and accurate inventory of all network assets, including
services and their configurations, to prevent unknown or unmanaged
exposures.</p></li>
