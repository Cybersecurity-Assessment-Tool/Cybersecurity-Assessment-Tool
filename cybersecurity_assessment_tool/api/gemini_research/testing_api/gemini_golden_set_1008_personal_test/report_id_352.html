<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of <strong>Titanium
Core</strong> based on a review of organizational data, security
questionnaire responses, and an external network scan. The assessment
identified several critical gaps in foundational security controls,
particularly concerning Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) implementation
and comprehensive security awareness training. While the external
network scan revealed no immediate exploitable open ports on the target,
the policy and procedural weaknesses present significant internal risks
that could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or operational
disruption. Immediate recommendations focus on implementing robust MFA
across key systems, developing essential security policies, and
establishing recurring security training programs.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A questionnaire was used to assess the current implementation of key

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was conducted on the target IP address . The
scan aimed to identify externally accessible services and potential
vulnerabilities.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="summary-of-findings">Summary of
Findings:</h2>
<p>The Nmap scan indicated that the target host is <strong>up</strong>
and reported all extra ports as <strong>closed</strong>. No open ports
or services were identified during this scan. This is a positive
finding, suggesting a well-hardened external perimeter from a basic
port-scanning perspective for the scanned target.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the security questionnaire and technical
scan, the following risks and gaps have been identified. Severity levels
are assigned based on potential impact and likelihood of
exploitation.</p>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of MFA for Email Access</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Without Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
for email, accounts are highly susceptible to credential stuffing,
phishing, and brute-force attacks. Compromised email can lead to
business email compromise (BEC), data loss, and unauthorized access to
other linked systems.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">High</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of MFA for Computer Logins</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Without MFA for computer logins, internal
systems are vulnerable to credential theft via malware, phishing, or
physical access. This significantly increases the risk of lateral
movement and privilege escalation within the network if a single set of
credentials is compromised.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">High</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Absence of Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP)</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">A lack of a formal AUP means employees may
not be aware of their responsibilities regarding company IT resources,
data handling, and internet usage. This can lead to increased legal
liabilities, data breaches, and non-compliance with industry regulations
due to employee misuse or negligence.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Medium</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Inadequate Annual Security Awareness
Training</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">While new employees receive training, the
absence of annual refresher training for all employees leads to
knowledge decay regarding evolving threats, best practices, and
organizational policies. This increases the human element risk, making
the organization more susceptible to phishing, social engineering, and
malware attacks over time.</td>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To enhance the cybersecurity posture of <strong>Titanium
Core</strong>, the following actionable recommendations are
provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email
Access:</strong> Immediately deploy and enforce MFA for all email
accounts. This critical control significantly reduces the risk of email
account compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer
Logins:</strong> Enforce MFA for all user logins to company computers
and endpoints. This adds a crucial layer of security against
unauthorized access, even if primary credentials are stolen.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a comprehensive AUP that clearly outlines
employee responsibilities and expectations regarding the use of company
IT resources, data, and internet access. Ensure all employees
acknowledge and understand this policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Annual Security Awareness Training for All
Employees:</strong> Supplement new employee training with mandatory
annual security awareness training for all staff. This ensures
continuous education on current threats, organizational policies, and
best practices, reinforcing a strong security culture.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regularly Review and Update Security Policies:</strong>
Periodically review all security policies and procedures (including the
AUP and training programs) to ensure they remain current with evolving
threats and technological changes.</p></li>
