<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the current cybersecurity posture of
<strong>Solid State</strong>, based on provided organizational data and
a security questionnaire review. The analysis reveals several critical
areas requiring immediate attention, primarily concerning multi-factor
authentication (MFA) implementation for sensitive systems and a
significant lack of regular security awareness training. Due to the
unavailability of external network scan data and pre-existing
vulnerability information, this assessment is based on self-reported
controls and highlights the critical need for comprehensive technical
scanning and vulnerability management. Immediate recommendations are
provided to address identified gaps and improve the overall security
stance.</p>

Results</h1>
<p>This section would typically detail findings from external network
scans, including open ports, services, and identified
vulnerabilities.</p>
<p><em>No external network scan data was provided for analysis.
Therefore, a comprehensive technical assessment of external exposure
could not be performed. It is strongly recommended to conduct regular
external vulnerability scanning to gain visibility into the external
attack surface.</em></p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment">4. Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This assessment correlates identified gaps from the security control
review with general cybersecurity best practices. Due to the lack of
external scan data and pre-existing vulnerability information, risks are
primarily derived from the questionnaire responses.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">5. Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the findings, the following recommendations are provided to
enhance Solid State’s cybersecurity posture:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong>
Immediately deploy and enforce multi-factor authentication for all
systems that store or process sensitive data. This is paramount to
protecting critical assets from unauthorized access due to compromised
credentials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Initiate Security Awareness Training for New
Hires:</strong> Develop and implement a mandatory security awareness
training program for all new employees during their onboarding process.
This should cover common threats, organizational policies, and best
practices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Annual Security Awareness Training:</strong>
Conduct mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees.
This training should be updated regularly to cover current threats,
phishing tactics, data handling best practices, and incident reporting
procedures.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct External Network Vulnerability Scans:</strong>
Perform regular (at least quarterly) external network vulnerability
scans against all external-facing IP addresses and domains. A
professional third-party assessment is recommended initially. Promptly
address all identified vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement a Comprehensive Vulnerability Management
Program:</strong> Establish a systematic program to regularly identify,
assess, prioritize, and remediate vulnerabilities across all IT assets,
including both internal and external systems, applications, and network
devices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Review and Update Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong>
While an AUP is in place, it should be regularly reviewed and updated
(e.g., annually) to reflect current technologies, emerging threats, and
organizational requirements. Ensure all employees acknowledge and
understand the policy.</p></li>
