<p>This report details the findings from a cybersecurity assessment
conducted for Skyward Bound. The assessment involved a review of
organizational security controls via a questionnaire and a network scan
of an internal host.</p>
<p>The primary findings indicate significant gaps in foundational
security practices, particularly concerning Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA), the absence of an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), and insufficient
security awareness training. While the technical scan of the target host
(<code>192.168.1.100</code>) did not reveal any open ports or
immediately exploitable services, the absence of active threats from
this specific scan does not negate the high-risk posture introduced by
the policy and control deficiencies.</p>
<p>These identified gaps pose substantial risks to the organization,
including unauthorized access, data breaches, and non-compliance with
industry best practices. Immediate action is recommended to address
these critical vulnerabilities to enhance the overall security
posture.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on the internal host . The scan aimed to
identify open ports, running services, and potential
vulnerabilities.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="scan-overview">Scan Overview</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Type:</strong> Nmap Port Scan</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="findings">Findings</h2>
<p>The Nmap scan reported that no open ports were found for the target
host . All scanned ports were reported as closed or filtered. This
finding suggests a potentially limited attack surface from a network
perspective on this specific host. However, it is crucial to understand
that this does not indicate overall security and must be complemented by
robust internal controls, user training, and policy enforcement. No
specific service vulnerabilities or outdated software versions were
identified through this scan.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the security control review, the following
high-priority risks have been identified. While the technical scan did
not reveal any network-level vulnerabilities, the policy and training
gaps represent significant security exposures. No pre-existing
vulnerabilities were provided in the input data.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and improve the overall
cybersecurity posture of Skyward Bound, the following recommendations
are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediately deploy and enforce MFA for
all critical systems, including email accounts, user logins to computers
and networks, and access to all sensitive data systems and
applications.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Significantly reduces the risk of
unauthorized access even if credentials are stolen, forming a crucial
layer of defense.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Create a comprehensive AUP that clearly
outlines employee responsibilities regarding the use of company IT
resources, data handling, and internet usage. Ensure all employees
review and acknowledge the policy annually.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Establishes clear guidelines, reduces
misuse of resources, enhances data protection, and improves
compliance.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Regular Security Awareness Training
Programs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Implement mandatory annual security
awareness training for all employees, supplementing the initial
onboarding training. This program should be dynamic, covering current
threats (e.g., phishing, ransomware), secure browsing habits, data
protection best practices, and the importance of reporting suspicious
activities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Enhances employee vigilance, reduces
human error, and strengthens the ’human firewall’ against social
engineering tactics.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Regular Internal Vulnerability Scans and
Penetration Tests:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> While this specific scan found no open
ports, it represents a limited snapshot. Implement a schedule for
regular, comprehensive internal vulnerability scans and penetration
tests across the entire network infrastructure to proactively identify
and address technical weaknesses in systems, applications, and
configurations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Proactively identifies and remediates
technical vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by malicious
actors.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Review and Strengthen Internal Security
Policies:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Review all existing security policies
(or create them if absent) to ensure they cover critical areas such as
incident response, data backup and recovery, access control, password
policies, and vendor management.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Creates a structured and comprehensive
security framework, ensuring consistent application of security best
practices throughout the organization.</p></li>
