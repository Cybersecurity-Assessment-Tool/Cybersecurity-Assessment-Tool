<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides an assessment of the current cybersecurity
posture for <strong>True North Travel</strong>, derived from network
scan data, organizational security questionnaire responses, and a review
of existing risk documentation. The assessment highlights a mixed
security posture, with several commendable practices in place,
particularly regarding multi-factor authentication (MFA) for email and
computer logins, and robust security awareness training programs for
employees.</p>
<p>However, critical vulnerabilities and significant security control
gaps have been identified. Notably, sensitive data systems are not
protected by MFA, leaving a critical exposure point for unauthorized
access should credentials be compromised. More alarmingly, a network
scan revealed an open port (8080) hosting a service explicitly titled
“TOP SECRET DB”. This finding directly contradicts existing risk
documentation that categorizes this very port as “confirmed secure and
false positive” with a CVSS score of 0.0. This severe discrepancy points
to a fundamental flaw in the current risk assessment and vulnerability
management process and represents an immediate and critical data
exposure risk.</p>
<p>Immediate recommendations include implementing MFA for all sensitive
data systems, urgently investigating and securing the service on port
8080, and a comprehensive re-evaluation of the organization’s risk
assessment and vulnerability management procedures to prevent future
oversights.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-security-control-gaps">Analysis of Security Control
Gaps</h2>
<p>The most significant gap identified from the questionnaire is the
lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for sensitive data systems.
While MFA is commendable for email and computer logins, its absence on
systems containing sensitive data significantly increases the risk of
unauthorized access, even if user credentials are compromised. This
represents a critical vulnerability that should be addressed immediately
to protect sensitive information.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was conducted against the target IP address
<code>10.5.5.5</code>. The scan aimed to identify open ports and
services, providing an external view of the network’s exposed attack
surface.</p>

<h3 id="critical-discrepancy-port-8080">Critical Discrepancy: Port
8080</h3>
<p>The scan revealed that port <code>8080</code> is open and hosting a
service with the HTTP title “TOP SECRET DB”. This finding is in direct
contradiction with the existing risk documentation
(Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON), which states the following regarding this
specific port:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Risk Name:</strong> “Port 8080 Secured”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Overview:</strong> “Port 8080 is confirmed secure and
false positive.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Severity (CVSS):</strong> 0.0</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The presence of a service openly broadcasting “TOP SECRET DB” on a
port previously deemed secure and a false positive represents an
extremely critical and unmanaged data exposure. This indicates a severe
failure in the organization’s vulnerability management and risk
assessment processes, posing an immediate threat of sensitive data
leakage.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of organizational data, security controls, and
technical scan results, the following key risks have been identified or
re-evaluated.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and strengthen the overall
cybersecurity posture, the following recommendations are provided:</p>
<h2 id="immediate-actions">Immediate Actions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong>
Immediately deploy and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication for all
systems that process or store sensitive organizational data. This should
be prioritized to drastically reduce the risk of unauthorized access via
compromised credentials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Urgent Investigation and Remediation of Port
8080:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Immediately investigate the service running on port at .</p></li>
<li><p>Identify the exact nature of the “TOP SECRET DB” service and the
type of data it exposes.</p></li>
<li><p>Take immediate steps to secure or shut down this service to
prevent unauthorized data access. If the service is legitimate and
required, implement robust authentication, authorization, and encryption
controls, and ensure it is not publicly accessible unless absolutely
necessary and properly secured (e.g., behind a firewall or
VPN).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Re-evaluate Risk Assessment Process:</strong> Conduct an
immediate audit and re-evaluation of the existing risk assessment and
vulnerability management processes. This review should aim to understand
how port was incorrectly categorized as secure and include reviewing
documentation, scan methodologies, and remediation verification steps to
prevent similar oversights.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="long-term-strategic-recommendations">Long-Term Strategic
Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Comprehensive Vulnerability Management Program:</strong>
Implement a robust and regular vulnerability scanning and management
program that includes authenticated scans, patch management, and
continuous monitoring of critical assets.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Penetration Testing:</strong> Schedule regular
penetration tests by independent third parties to simulate real-world
attacks and uncover vulnerabilities that automated scans might
miss.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Security Policy Review and Update:</strong> Periodically
review and update all security policies, including the acceptable use
policy, data handling policies, and incident response plans, to ensure
they remain relevant, comprehensive, and effective.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enhanced Security Awareness Training:</strong> While
current training is good, consider implementing advanced modules
focusing on specific threats (e.g., social engineering, secure data
handling best practices) and reinforce the importance of reporting
suspicious activities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Asset Inventory and Classification:</strong> Maintain an
accurate and up-to-date inventory of all IT assets, categorizing them by
criticality and data sensitivity, to ensure appropriate security
controls are applied consistently.</p></li>
