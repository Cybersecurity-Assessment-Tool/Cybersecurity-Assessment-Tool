<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings from a cybersecurity posture
assessment for Borealis Tech, incorporating organizational self-reported
data, external network scan results, and a review of existing risk
documentation. The assessment highlights critical security gaps,
particularly concerning Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) implementation
and the exposure of potentially sensitive information on an internal
network port. A significant discrepancy was identified where an internal
scan revealed an open port 8080 hosting a service titled "TOP SECRET
DB," directly contradicting a previous internal assessment that marked
this port as "Secured" and a false positive. Immediate action is
required to address these vulnerabilities and fortify the organization’s
security controls.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-questionnaire-gaps">Analysis of
Questionnaire Gaps</h2>
<p>The questionnaire responses reveal critical gaps in Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) implementation:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA for Email (Q1):</strong> The absence of MFA for email
access is a severe vulnerability. Email accounts are frequent targets
for phishing and account compromise, and without MFA, a single
compromised password can grant attackers access to sensitive
communications and pivot points within the organization.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>MFA for Computer Logins (Q2):</strong> Similarly, not
requiring MFA for computer logins significantly increases the risk of
unauthorized access to workstations and internal network resources. If
an attacker gains valid credentials, they can potentially move laterally
within the network without further authentication challenges.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>While MFA is used for sensitive data systems (Q3), the lack of it for
email and computer logins creates significant entry points for
attackers. Positive responses for AUP and security awareness training
(Q4, Q5, Q6) are commendable, but their effectiveness is reduced if
fundamental authentication controls are missing.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An internal network scan was performed targeting
<code>10.5.5.5</code>. The scan date was not explicitly provided in the
input metadata, but the findings are based on the latest available scan
data.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>10.5.5.5</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> 2026-01-27</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="detailed-findings">Detailed Findings</h2>
<p>The Nmap scan revealed the following critical information:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Open Port:</strong> <code>8080</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Service Details:</strong> A service running on port 8080
was identified, which, through an ‘http-title‘ script, exposed the title
<code>"TOP SECRET DB"</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This finding is highly concerning. The presence of an open port
displaying a title explicitly stating "TOP SECRET DB" strongly indicates
exposure of sensitive data or a critical internal system. While the scan
did not identify specific product versions, the title itself is
sufficient to warrant immediate investigation and remediation.</p>

</div>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="risk-correlation-and-discrepancy-analysis">Risk Correlation and
Discrepancy Analysis</h2>
<p>The most alarming finding is the direct contradiction between the
recent network scan and the organization’s existing risk documentation.
Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON indicated that "Port 8080 is confirmed secure
and false positive" with a severity of 0.0. However, the Nmap scan
(Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON) clearly shows port 8080 open on
<code>10.5.5.5</code> with the HTTP title "TOP SECRET DB".</p>
<p>This discrepancy suggests:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The prior assessment was erroneous or based on outdated
information.</p></li>
<li><p>The system configuration changed, exposing sensitive data,
without a corresponding update to the risk register.</p></li>
<li><p>The "TOP SECRET DB" title itself indicates critical information
is being exposed, regardless of previous assessments.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This contradiction elevates the risk associated with port 8080 to
Critical and also raises concerns about the reliability of the existing
risk management processes.</p>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and strengthen Borealis Tech’s
cybersecurity posture, the following recommendations are provided:</p>
<h2 id="immediate-actions-critical-risks">Immediate Actions (Critical
Risks)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Investigate and Secure Port 8080
(<code>10.5.5.5</code>):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Immediately investigate the service running on port
<code>8080</code> on host <code>10.5.5.5</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Determine the nature of the "TOP SECRET DB" and the type of data
it contains.</p></li>
<li><p>If the service is not intended to be publicly accessible, apply
immediate firewall rules to block access.</p></li>
<li><p>If the service is internal, ensure it is properly authenticated
and authorized, and that sensitive information is not exposed in service
banners or titles.</p></li>
<li><p>Change the service title to remove any indication of sensitive
content.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Re-evaluate Risk Management Process:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Conduct an urgent review of the process by which risks,
especially those marked as "false positives" or "secured," are validated
and updated.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure future risk assessments are correlated with up-to-date
technical scans and vulnerability reports.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="high-priority-recommendations-high-risks">High Priority
Recommendations (High Risks)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Access:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mandate Multi-Factor Authentication for all employee email
accounts. This should be a top priority to protect against phishing and
credential stuffing attacks.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide clear instructions and support for employees during the
rollout.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Logins:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Deploy and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication for all computer
logins, especially for devices accessing sensitive internal networks or
data.</p></li>
<li><p>Explore solutions like smart cards, FIDO2 keys, or biometric
authentication integrated with directory services.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="general-security-enhancements">General Security
Enhancements</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Regular Vulnerability Scanning:</strong> Implement a
regular schedule for internal and external vulnerability scanning to
proactively identify and address security weaknesses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Security Awareness Training Reinforcement:</strong> While
security awareness training is conducted, reinforce the importance of
identifying and reporting suspicious activity, especially in light of
potential open ports or exposed sensitive titles.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Incident Response Plan:</strong> Ensure a well-defined
and tested incident response plan is in place to handle potential
security breaches, especially those involving sensitive data
exposure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Asset Inventory and Management:</strong> Maintain an
accurate and up-to-date inventory of all network assets, including their
purpose, location, and owners. This will help in understanding the
context of services like the one on port 8080.</p></li>
