<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This document presents a comprehensive cybersecurity posture
assessment for Evergreen Alliance. The assessment aims to identify
potential vulnerabilities, assess the effectiveness of current security
controls, and provide actionable recommendations for improvement. The
analysis is based on three primary data sources: a network scan, a
security questionnaire, and a review of documented current risks.</p>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A security questionnaire was completed to assess the implementation
of foundational security controls within Evergreen Alliance. The
responses are summarized below:</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="key-observations-from-security-control-review">Key Observations from
Security Control Review</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Evergreen Alliance has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) for email and computer login, which is a strong security practice
that significantly reduces the risk of credential compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Critical Gap:</strong> MFA is <strong>not
required</strong> for accessing sensitive data systems. This leaves
critical data vulnerable to unauthorized access if a single set of
credentials is stolen or compromised.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Critical Gap:</strong> There is <strong>no documented
employee acceptable use policy</strong>. The absence of such a policy
can lead to inconsistent employee behavior, misuse of company resources,
potential data breaches, and difficulties in enforcing cybersecurity
best practices.</p></li>
<li><p>The practice of conducting regular security awareness training
for both new and existing employees is highly commendable and helps
foster a security-conscious culture.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on the specified target to identify open
ports and services that could represent potential entry points for
attackers.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>192.168.1.100</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Status:</strong> The target host was found to be
<code>up</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="detailed-scan-findings">Detailed Scan
Findings</h2>
<p>The network scan of <code>192.168.1.100</code> identified <strong>no
open ports</strong> for the services scanned. All scanned ports were
reported as <code>closed</code>. This indicates a minimal network attack
surface on the specified target from the perspective of external port
exposure. While this is a positive finding, it is important to note that
network port scanning alone does not provide a complete security
assessment. It does not identify vulnerabilities within applications,
misconfigurations on hosts, or weaknesses in internal network segments.
Further internal assessments, vulnerability scanning of applications,
and host-based security reviews are recommended for a comprehensive
understanding.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the security questionnaire and technical
scan results, the following risks have been identified:</p>
<table>
<thead>

<th style="text-align: left;"><strong>Risk Name</strong></th>
<th style="text-align: left;"><strong>Overview</strong></th>
<th style="text-align: left;"><strong>Severity</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Inadequate MFA for Sensitive Data
Systems</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not
enforced for access to systems containing sensitive data. This
significantly increases the likelihood of unauthorized access and data
breaches if credentials are compromised, leading to potential data loss,
reputational damage, and regulatory penalties.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">High</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of Employee Acceptable Use
Policy</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The absence of an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP) means there are no formal guidelines governing employee behavior
regarding company IT resources. This can lead to misuse of assets, data
leakage, compliance violations, and increased insider threat risks due
to unclear expectations.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Medium</td>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following recommendations are provided to address the identified
risks and enhance the overall cybersecurity posture of Evergreen
Alliance:</p>
<h2 id="immediate-actions">Immediate Actions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong>
Immediately enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all systems,
applications, and databases that store, process, or transmit sensitive
organizational data. This should be a top priority to mitigate
unauthorized access risks. Conduct an inventory of all sensitive data
systems to ensure comprehensive MFA coverage.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a comprehensive AUP that clearly outlines
employee responsibilities, permitted and prohibited activities
concerning company IT resources, data handling, and internet usage. The
policy should address areas such as password management, data
classification, remote access, software installation, and use of
personal devices. Once developed, communicate it to all employees and
require mandatory acknowledgment and regular review.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="general-security-enhancements">General Security
Enhancements</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Regular Vulnerability Scanning:</strong> While the
current network scan showed no open ports on the specified target,
regular internal and external vulnerability scans of all network assets,
including applications and systems, should be conducted to identify
configuration weaknesses, outdated software, and known
vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Penetration Testing:</strong> Consider periodic
penetration tests to simulate real-world attacks and identify
exploitable vulnerabilities that automated scans might miss,
particularly for critical applications and infrastructure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Incident Response Plan Review and Testing:</strong>
Ensure an up-to-date and well-tested incident response plan is in place
to effectively detect, contain, and recover from security incidents.
Regular tabletop exercises should be conducted.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Principle of Least Privilege:</strong> Implement the
principle of least privilege across all user accounts and systems,
ensuring users and applications only have access to resources absolutely
necessary for their job functions. Regularly review and revoke
unnecessary privileges.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Evergreen Alliance demonstrates a commendable commitment to security
awareness training and MFA for basic access. However, critical
vulnerabilities exist in the lack of MFA for sensitive data systems and
the absence of an acceptable use policy. Addressing these high-priority
gaps, coupled with continuous security practices, will significantly
strengthen the organization’s defense against cyber threats and build a
more resilient cybersecurity posture.</p>
