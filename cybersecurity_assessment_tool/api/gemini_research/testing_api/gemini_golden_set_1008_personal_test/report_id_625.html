<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings from a cybersecurity posture
assessment conducted for <strong>Blackwood Industries</strong>. The
assessment involved a review of organizational security controls via a
questionnaire, a technical network scan of a specified internal host,
and a review of existing risk data.</p>
<p>The overall security posture reveals significant areas for
improvement, particularly concerning Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
implementation and comprehensive security awareness training. Several
critical gaps were identified, indicating a heightened risk of
unauthorized access and successful social engineering attacks due to
weak controls around identity and access management and human factors. A
key technical finding was the presence of an outdated web server (Nginx
1.18.0) that could be vulnerable to known exploits, along with an SSL
certificate common name mismatch suggesting potential
misconfiguration.</p>
<p>Urgent recommendations focus on implementing MFA across all sensitive
systems and user logins, establishing robust security awareness training
programs for both new and existing employees, and promptly updating
software to mitigate identified technical vulnerabilities. Addressing
these areas will significantly enhance Blackwood Industries’ defensive
capabilities against prevalent cyber threats and reduce the attack
surface.</p>

<h1 id="sec:recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actionable recommendations are provided to address the
identified risks and significantly improve the overall cybersecurity
posture of Blackwood Industries. Recommendations are prioritized based
on their impact and urgency.</p>
<h2 id="immediate-actions-high-priority">Immediate Actions (High
Priority)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for All
Computer Logins:</strong> Deploy and rigorously enforce MFA for all user
accounts logging into company computers, workstations, and internal
systems. This is a foundational control to protect against credential
compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive
Data Systems:</strong> Extend mandatory MFA requirements to all systems
and applications that store, process, or transmit sensitive
organizational or client data. This includes databases, critical
business applications, and cloud services.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Mandatory Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong> Develop and implement a comprehensive security
awareness program that all new hires must complete as part of their
onboarding process. This training should cover phishing, social
engineering, password hygiene, and company security policies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Annual Security Awareness Training for All
Employees:</strong> Conduct mandatory security awareness training for
all employees at least once per year. This training should be updated
regularly to reflect current threat landscapes and reinforce security
best practices.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="medium-to-long-term-actions">Medium to Long-Term Actions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade Nginx Web Server Software:</strong> Plan and
execute a controlled upgrade of the Nginx web server to the latest
stable version (e.g., 1.24.0 or newer). This will ensure the system
benefits from the latest security patches, bug fixes, and performance
improvements. Ensure proper testing is conducted in a staging
environment before production deployment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Resolve SSL Certificate Common Name Mismatch:</strong>
Investigate why the SSL certificate common name is ‘www.acme-corp.com‘
for a service seemingly related to Blackwood Industries. Ensure that
appropriate, valid SSL/TLS certificates with common names that correctly
match the hostnames or domains of the services are deployed for all
public-facing and internal services requiring encryption.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The assessment highlights several critical vulnerabilities and
control gaps within Blackwood Industries’ current cybersecurity posture.
If left unaddressed, these issues could significantly increase the
organization’s exposure to common cyber threats, potentially leading to
unauthorized access, data breaches, and operational disruptions. By
prioritizing the implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication,
establishing comprehensive and continuous security awareness training
programs, and addressing technical findings such as outdated software
and certificate mismatches, Blackwood Industries can substantially
enhance its resilience against cyber threats and effectively protect its
valuable assets and sensitive information.</p>
