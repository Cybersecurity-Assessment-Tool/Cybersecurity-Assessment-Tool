<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This document presents a cybersecurity posture assessment for
<strong>Bluebird Bio</strong>. The assessment combines insights from a
targeted network scan, an organizational security questionnaire, and a
review of existing risk data. The objective is to identify critical
vulnerabilities, assess the current security controls, and provide
actionable recommendations to mitigate identified risks and strengthen
the organization’s defense mechanisms.</p>

</div>
<h2 id="questionnaire-analysis">Questionnaire Analysis</h2>
<p>The questionnaire responses reveal significant gaps:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Email and Sensitive Data:</strong> The
absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and
sensitive data systems is a critical vulnerability. This significantly
increases the risk of account compromise through phishing or brute-force
attacks, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized access to
critical information.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> The lack
of a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy is a major governance and
compliance gap. An AUP sets clear expectations for employee behavior
regarding company IT resources, reducing insider threats and ensuring
adherence to security best practices. Without one, employees may
unknowingly engage in risky behavior.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on the target <code>192.168.1.100</code>
using Nmap. The scan was conducted to identify open ports, running
services, and potential vulnerabilities exposed to the network.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>192.168.1.100</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Status:</strong> The host is reported as
‘up‘.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports and Services:</strong> The scan did not
identify any open ports or running services on the target
<code>192.168.1.100</code>. All detected extra ports were reported as
‘closed‘.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="technical-analysis">Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>The finding of no open ports on the scanned target
<code>192.168.1.100</code> is generally positive from a network
perimeter perspective for this specific host, suggesting a well-hardened
configuration for external network exposure. However, it is crucial to
understand that this scan provides a snapshot of network-level services
and does not assess:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Internal vulnerabilities (e.g., misconfigured software, missing
patches).</p></li>
<li><p>Web application vulnerabilities (if any web services run on
non-standard ports or internally).</p></li>
<li><p>Host-based security controls.</p></li>
<li><p>Overall system configurations beyond basic network port
enumeration.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, while the initial network scan is favorable for this
specific host, it should not be taken as a comprehensive assurance of
the system’s security posture.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the questionnaire and technical scan, the
following risks have been identified:</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and enhance <strong>Bluebird
Bio</strong>’s cybersecurity posture, the following recommendations are
provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Access (Critical):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediately enable and enforce
Multi-Factor Authentication for all user accounts accessing email
systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> This will significantly reduce the risk
of account takeover even if passwords are compromised, protecting
against phishing, credential stuffing, and business email compromise
(BEC) attacks.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems
(Critical):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Require MFA for logging into all systems
that contain or provide access to sensitive organizational
data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> This adds a crucial layer of security,
protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access and potential
data exfiltration.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(High):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Draft, disseminate, and enforce a
comprehensive Acceptable Use Policy for all employees regarding the use
of company IT assets, networks, and data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Establishes clear guidelines, reduces
insider threats, minimizes accidental data exposure, and supports
compliance with industry regulations. Ensure all employees acknowledge
and understand the policy.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Continue Robust Security Awareness Training (Good
Practice):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Maintain and enhance existing security
awareness training programs for new hires and annually for all
employees. Incorporate specific modules on identifying phishing attempts
and the importance of MFA and AUP.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> A well-informed workforce is the first
line of defense against social engineering attacks and helps foster a
security-conscious culture.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Regular and Comprehensive Internal Scans
(Ongoing):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> While the recent scan showed no open
ports on the target, conduct regular, authenticated vulnerability scans
and penetration tests of internal networks, applications, and
systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Identifies misconfigurations, unpatched
software, and other vulnerabilities that a non-credentialed network scan
might miss, providing a more complete picture of the internal security
posture.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p><strong>Bluebird Bio</strong> demonstrates a foundational
understanding of security with strong security awareness training
programs and MFA for computer logins. However, critical vulnerabilities
exist due to the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for email and
sensitive data systems, and the absence of a formal Employee Acceptable
Use Policy. The technical scan of a specific internal host was positive
with no open ports detected. By promptly addressing the identified
critical and high-severity risks through the recommended actions,
<strong>Bluebird Bio</strong> can significantly enhance its resilience
against common cyber threats and strengthen its overall security
posture.</p>
