<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings from a cybersecurity assessment
conducted for Apex Legends Group. The assessment involved a review of
organizational security controls through a questionnaire and a technical
scan of a specified internal host.</p>
<p>Overall, the technical scan revealed a positive posture for the
specific target <code>192.168.1.100</code>, with no open ports detected.
This suggests effective host hardening or network segmentation. However,
the organizational security control review identified several critical
gaps that significantly elevate the overall risk profile. Key
deficiencies include a lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
email and sensitive data systems, the absence of an employee acceptable
use policy, and inadequate annual security awareness training.</p>
<p>These control deficiencies represent significant vectors for
potential compromise through phishing, credential theft, and insider
threats. Immediate remediation efforts should focus on implementing MFA
across critical systems and strengthening the organization’s security
awareness program and foundational policies.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on the specified target.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong>
<code>Not specified in input; assumed date of report creation.</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Target Host:</strong> <code>192.168.1.100</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Used:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> Up</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="detailed-findings">Detailed Findings</h2>
<p>The Nmap scan against <code>192.168.1.100</code> indicated that the
host was online ("up"), but no open ports were detected. All 1000 common
ports scanned were reported as "closed".</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports Found:</strong> None</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Services Identified:</strong> None</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Products/Versions Identified:</strong> None</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This finding suggests that the host <code>192.168.1.100</code> is
either well-hardened with no network services exposed, or it is
protected by a firewall that blocks all inbound connection attempts from
the scanning source. While this is a positive indicator for the specific
host under the conditions of this scan, it is important to note
that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This scan focused on a single internal IP address.</p></li>
<li><p>Comprehensive internal network scans covering all assets would
provide a more complete picture.</p></li>
<li><p>Services running on non-standard ports might not have been
detected if only common ports were scanned.</p></li>
<li><p>This report does not include findings for vulnerabilities (e.g.,
outdated software) as no services were identified on open
ports.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the security control review and technical
scan results, the following risks have been identified.</p>
<h2 id="identified-risks">Identified Risks</h2>
<p>The primary risks identified stem from the deficiencies in
organizational security controls.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and enhance the overall
cybersecurity posture of Apex Legends Group, the following
recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
Email:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Enable and enforce MFA for all email accounts immediately. This
significantly reduces the risk of successful phishing and credential
theft attacks.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive
Data Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Prioritize the implementation of MFA for all systems that store,
process, or transmit sensitive organizational or client data.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create a comprehensive AUP that clearly outlines employee
responsibilities, acceptable use of company IT resources, and
consequences for non-compliance.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all employees review and acknowledge the AUP
annually.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish and Conduct Annual Security Awareness
Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement a mandatory, comprehensive security awareness training
program for all employees at least once per year.</p></li>
<li><p>Training should cover topics such as phishing, social
engineering, password hygiene, data handling, and reporting suspicious
activities.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Expand Internal Network Scanning (Future
Consideration):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>While the current scan of <code>192.168.1.100</code> showed no
open ports, consider performing more extensive internal network scans
across the entire infrastructure. This would help identify other
potentially vulnerable hosts or services.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct vulnerability assessments and penetration tests to
identify deeper security weaknesses.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Review and Update Security Policies
Regularly:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Establish a schedule for regular review and updates of all
security policies and procedures (e.g., incident response plan, data
backup policy, access control policy).</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>By addressing these critical gaps, Apex Legends Group can
significantly enhance its defensive capabilities against common cyber
threats and build a more robust security posture.</p>
