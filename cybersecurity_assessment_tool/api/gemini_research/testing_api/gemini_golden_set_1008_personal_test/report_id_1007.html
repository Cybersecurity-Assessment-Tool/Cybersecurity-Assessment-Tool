<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This cybersecurity posture report for reveals several areas requiring
immediate attention. While some foundational controls are in place,
critical vulnerabilities and control gaps were identified. Specifically,
the organization lacks Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and
sensitive data systems, significantly increasing the risk of
unauthorized access. Furthermore, security awareness training is not
conducted annually for all employees, leaving the organization
susceptible to social engineering attacks. A pre-existing high-severity
risk related to exposed localhost services further compounds the
technical risk profile. Addressing these core issues through strategic
implementation of MFA, consistent training, and targeted technical
remediation is crucial for improving ’s resilience against cyber
threats.</p>

<p><em>Note</em>: This particular scan output did not provide
information regarding service names, products, or versions for the open

<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the organizational information, self-assessment, technical
scan, and pre-existing risk data, the following key risks and gaps have
been identified.</p>
<h2 id="identified-critical-gaps-from-self-assessment">Identified
Critical Gaps from Self-Assessment</h2>
<p>The self-assessment highlighted several critical gaps in security
controls:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Email Access</strong>: Not requiring MFA
for email access is a significant vulnerability. Email accounts are
frequent targets for phishing and account takeover, and without MFA, a
compromised password can grant attackers full access to sensitive
communications and potentially lead to further breaches.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems</strong>: Failure
to implement MFA for sensitive data systems poses an extreme risk.
Unauthorized access to these systems can lead to data breaches,
regulatory non-compliance, reputational damage, and severe financial
penalties.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training</strong>:
While new employees receive training, the lack of annual refresher
training for all employees means that critical security best practices,
emerging threats, and organizational policies may not be consistently
reinforced, leaving the organization vulnerable to human-factor
attacks.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="existing-vulnerabilities">Existing Vulnerabilities</h2>
<p>The following pre-existing vulnerability was provided for
assessment:</p>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p>The ‘Localhost Exposed‘ vulnerability, with a maximum CVSS score of
10.0, indicates a highly critical issue. The Nmap scan confirming an
open port (Port 22) on directly correlates with this existing risk.
While localhost services are typically not directly accessible from
external networks, an improperly configured firewall or a compromised
internal system could expose this critical service, allowing an attacker
to gain privileged access.</p>

cybersecurity incidents.</p></li>
<li><p>Regularly test the IRP through tabletop exercises.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Security Audits and Assessments</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Schedule periodic third-party security audits and penetration
tests to gain an objective view of the security posture.</p></li>
