<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of Copperhead Cables
based on an analysis of provided organizational data, network scan
results, and reported existing risks. The assessment highlights a
generally moderate security posture with several critical gaps related
to Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) implementation and new employee
security awareness training. While the network scan revealed no
immediately exploitable open ports on the targeted internal host,
existing reported risks indicate potential vulnerabilities that warrant
attention. Recommendations are provided to mitigate identified risks and
enhance the overall security framework.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">3. Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>This section details the findings from the network scan performed on
the specified target.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="scan-metadata">3.1 Scan Metadata</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Used:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>192.168.0.5</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not specified in provided
data.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="port-scan-findings">3.2 Port Scan
Findings</h2>
<p>The Nmap scan against <code>192.168.0.5</code> identified the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 80 (HTTP):</strong> Found to be
<strong>closed</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>No open ports or active services were identified during this specific
scan on the target <code>192.168.0.5</code>. This indicates a relatively
locked-down posture for this particular host, or that the host was not
fully reachable/responsive in a way that would reveal open ports with
the given scan parameters. It’s important to note that the existing
vulnerability assessment (Section 4) mentions an "Unencrypted Web
Server" on port 80 being open, which contradicts this scan finding for
<code>192.168.0.5</code>. This discrepancy should be investigated.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment">4. Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This assessment combines findings from the security control review,
technical scan results, and reported existing vulnerabilities to provide
a comprehensive view of the organization’s risk landscape.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="identified-gaps-from-security-control-review">4.1 Identified Gaps
from Security Control Review</h2>
<p>The following critical gaps were identified based on the
organization’s responses to the security questionnaire:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Computer Login:</strong> Not requiring
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers
significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access through
compromised credentials, potentially leading to broader network
compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> Failure
to implement MFA for systems containing sensitive data exposes critical
information to a higher risk of compromise, potentially leading to
severe data breaches and regulatory non-compliance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Insufficient Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong> New employees often lack the immediate understanding
of an organization’s specific security policies and threat landscape.
Without initial security awareness training, they represent a
significant social engineering vector, increasing the risk of phishing
and other human-factor attacks.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="existing-reported-vulnerabilities">4.2

<p>The organization reported the following pre-existing
vulnerabilities:</p>

</div>
<p><em>Note:</em> As mentioned in Section 3.2, the technical scan on
<code>192.168.0.5</code> found Port 80 to be closed. This suggests that
either this specific risk pertains to a different asset, or the reported
risk in Input 3 is outdated or inaccurate concerning this particular
scanned IP. Further clarification from Copperhead Cables is recommended
to reconcile this discrepancy.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">5. Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis, the following actionable recommendations are
provided to enhance Copperhead Cables’ cybersecurity posture:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Broadly:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Extend MFA requirements to all computer logins across the
organization to significantly bolster protection against
credential-based attacks.</p></li>
<li><p>Mandate MFA for accessing all systems containing sensitive data.
This is a critical control for protecting against unauthorized access to
critical information assets.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Enhance New Employee Security Awareness
Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Establish a mandatory, comprehensive security awareness training
program for all new employees, to be completed prior to granting access
to organizational systems and data. This training should cover topics
such as phishing, social engineering, password hygiene, and data
handling policies.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Address Reported Unencrypted Web Server
Risk:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Investigate the discrepancy regarding the "Unencrypted Web
Server" risk. If this risk applies to other assets, ensure all
public-facing web services enforce HTTPS and do not expose unencrypted
HTTP (Port 80) traffic. If Port 80 is necessary for specific use cases
(e.g., redirection), ensure it immediately redirects to HTTPS.</p></li>
<li><p>Regularly scan and audit all web servers for proper SSL/TLS
configuration and ensure deprecated protocols or weak ciphers are not in
use.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Continuous Monitoring and Vulnerability
Management:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing
across the entire network infrastructure to proactively identify and
address security weaknesses.</p></li>
<li><p>Establish a robust patch management program to ensure all
operating systems, applications, and network devices are kept up-to-date
with the latest security patches, reducing exposure to known
vulnerabilities.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

Cybersecurity is an evolving field, and continuous monitoring,
adaptation, and improvement of security controls are essential to
maintain a strong security posture.</p>
