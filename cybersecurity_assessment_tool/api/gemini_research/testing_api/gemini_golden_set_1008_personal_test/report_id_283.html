<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment for Zenith Point. The assessment was conducted by analyzing
an organizational security questionnaire, a network scan, and reviewing
any pre-existing vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Overall, Zenith Point demonstrates a foundational understanding of
some security practices, such as requiring Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) for email access and having an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP).
However, significant gaps were identified in critical areas that pose a
high risk to the organization. These include the lack of MFA for
computer logins and sensitive data systems, and a crucial absence of
security awareness training for new employees. A network scan also
revealed an open SSH service (port 22) without further versioning
details, indicating a potential attack surface that requires careful
management.</p>
<p>The recommendations outlined in this report aim to address these
vulnerabilities and enhance Zenith Point’s overall security posture,
focusing on immediate remediation actions and strategic
improvements.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-questionnaire-gaps">Analysis of
Questionnaire Gaps</h2>
<p>The questionnaire highlights several critical areas for
improvement:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins:</strong> Not requiring
MFA for computer logins significantly increases the risk of unauthorized
access in the event of credential compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> Similar
to computer logins, the absence of MFA for systems handling sensitive
data exposes critical information to a higher risk of breach.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong> New hires often represent a significant attack
vector if not adequately trained on security best practices from the
outset. This increases susceptibility to phishing, social engineering,
and other common threats.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was conducted against the target IPv6 address
<code>2001:db8::1</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target Host:</strong> <code>2001:db8::1</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not provided in the input
data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Tool:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> Up</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="open-ports-and-services">Open Ports and
Services:</h3>
<p>The scan identified the following open port:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 22/tcp:</strong> State: Open. Commonly associated
with SSH (Secure Shell).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: The provided scan data did not include specific service
versions or product information for port 22, limiting the ability to
assess potential vulnerabilities related to outdated software
directly.</em></p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of
Technical Findings</h2>
<p>The presence of an open SSH (port 22) service indicates that the
target system is likely configured for remote access. While SSH is a
secure protocol when properly configured, an open port always represents
a potential attack surface. Without versioning or service details,
specific vulnerabilities cannot be identified, but general risks
include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Brute-force Attacks:</strong> Attackers may attempt to
guess login credentials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Vulnerabilities in SSH Implementation:</strong> Outdated
or improperly configured SSH servers can be vulnerable to
exploits.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Exposure to Zero-Days:</strong> Any network service is a
potential entry point for unknown vulnerabilities.</p></li>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="detailed-risk-descriptions">Detailed Risk
Descriptions</h2>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="lack-of-mfa-for-computer-logins">6.1.1. Lack
of MFA for Computer Logins</h3>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds a
crucial layer of security by requiring users to provide two or more
verification factors to gain access to a resource. The absence of MFA
for computer logins means that a single compromised password could grant
an attacker full access to an employee’s workstation and potentially the
internal network. This is a significant vulnerability given the
prevalence of phishing and credential stuffing attacks.
<strong>Impact:</strong> Unauthorized system access, lateral movement,
data theft, malware infection. <strong>Severity:</strong> High</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="lack-of-mfa-for-sensitive-data-systems">6.1.2. Lack of MFA for
Sensitive Data Systems</h3>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong> Similar to computer logins, not requiring
MFA for access to systems that store or process sensitive data directly
exposes critical information to a higher risk. If an attacker gains
access to a user’s credentials, they could directly exfiltrate or
manipulate sensitive organizational data without an additional
authentication challenge. <strong>Impact:</strong> Data breach,
regulatory non-compliance, reputational damage, financial loss.
<strong>Severity:</strong> High</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="no-security-awareness-training-for-new-employees">6.1.3. No Security
Awareness Training for New Employees</h3>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees are typically unfamiliar
with an organization’s specific security policies, common threat
vectors, and internal procedures. Without mandatory initial security
awareness training, they are highly susceptible to social engineering
attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) which can lead to credential theft,
malware deployment, or sensitive information disclosure.
<strong>Impact:</strong> Successful social engineering attacks,
credential compromise, malware infection, internal policy violations.
<strong>Severity:</strong> Medium</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="open-ssh-service-port-22">6.1.4. Open SSH
Service (Port 22)</h3>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH service on an external
interface, without detailed configuration or version information,
represents a potential entry point for attackers. While SSH is secure by
design, it can be exploited if weak passwords are used, default
credentials are not changed, or if the service is running an unpatched
or outdated version. The lack of version information in the scan makes
it impossible to rule out known vulnerabilities.
<strong>Impact:</strong> Unauthorized remote access, system compromise,
data exfiltration, service disruption. <strong>Severity:</strong>
Medium</p>
