<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">1. Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report outlines the cybersecurity posture of <strong>Neon Pulse
Entertainment</strong> based on a review of organizational security
controls and an analysis of provided network scan data. While no
external technical vulnerabilities were identified due to the absence of
specific scan results, the organizational control review revealed
significant gaps. Specifically, the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) for email and computer logins, the absence of an Acceptable Use
Policy (AUP), and the complete lack of security awareness training for
employees represent critical risks to the organization’s information
security. Addressing these fundamental deficiencies is crucial for
enhancing the overall security posture and reducing the likelihood of
successful cyberattacks.</p>

Results</h1>
<p>A network scan targeting <code>[Target IP]</code> was indicated, but
no specific scan results or open ports were provided in the input data.
Therefore, this report cannot provide specific technical findings or
vulnerabilities based on an external network scan at this time.</p>
<p><em>It is recommended that a full and comprehensive network scan be
conducted against all external-facing infrastructure, and its results be
thoroughly analyzed to identify any potential externally exploitable
vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or outdated software.</em></p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment">5. Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the security control review, several critical risks have
been identified due to the absence or insufficient implementation of
fundamental security practices. No pre-existing vulnerabilities were
provided in the input data, and no technical vulnerabilities were found
from the provided scan data.</p>

</tr>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of MFA on Email</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">High</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Without Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA),
email accounts are highly vulnerable to credential stuffing, phishing,
and brute-force attacks. A compromised email account can lead to
business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and unauthorized
access to other linked services.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of MFA on Computers</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">High</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The absence of MFA for computer logins
significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to internal
systems. If credentials are stolen or guessed, attackers can gain a
foothold within the network, potentially leading to data breaches,
ransomware, or other malicious activities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">No Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP)</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Medium</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Without a formal AUP, employees may be
unaware of their responsibilities regarding the secure and appropriate
use of IT resources. This lack of clear guidelines increases the risk of
misuse, data leakage, legal non-compliance, and operational
inefficiencies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">No Security Awareness Training for New
Employees</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">High</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">New employees often represent a higher
risk as they may not be immediately familiar with the organization’s
specific security protocols, policies, and common threat vectors. This
makes them particularly susceptible to social engineering attacks such
as phishing, leading to potential compromises.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">No Annual Security Awareness Training</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">High</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Regular, recurring security awareness
training is crucial for keeping all employees updated on evolving threat
landscapes, new attack methods, and best practices. Without annual
training, employee vigilance may decline, and their knowledge of current
cyber threats can become outdated, increasing the overall human attack
surface.</td>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">6. Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and improve the overall cybersecurity
posture of <strong>Neon Pulse Entertainment</strong>, the following
recommendations are provided:</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="implement-multi-factor-authentication-mfa">6.1. Implement
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Mandate and implement MFA for
all employee email accounts. This should be a top priority.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Mandate and implement MFA for
all computer logins, especially for devices accessing sensitive
organizational data or network resources.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Significantly reduces the risk of
unauthorized access even if primary credentials are stolen, making it
much harder for attackers to compromise accounts and systems.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="develop-and-enforce-an-acceptable-use-policy-aup">6.2. Develop and
Enforce an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Develop a clear, comprehensive,
and legally reviewed Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) that outlines employee
responsibilities for using organizational IT resources.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Ensure all employees read,
understand, and formally acknowledge the AUP upon hiring and
periodically thereafter.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Establishes clear expectations for
secure behavior, reduces misuse of IT assets, and helps mitigate risks
associated with insider threats and compliance violations.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="establish-a-robust-security-awareness-training-program">6.3.
Establish a Robust Security Awareness Training Program</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Implement mandatory security
awareness training for all new employees during their onboarding
process. This training should cover common threats (e.g., phishing,
social engineering), password best practices, data handling, and
organizational security policies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Conduct mandatory annual
security awareness training for all existing employees. This training
should be updated regularly to reflect current threat trends and
reinforce secure behaviors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Empowers employees to recognize and
report suspicious activities, transforms them into a stronger line of
defense, and significantly reduces the organization’s susceptibility to
human-factor cyberattacks.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="conduct-comprehensive-technical-scans">6.4.
Conduct Comprehensive Technical Scans</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Perform regular, authenticated
internal and external network vulnerability scans.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Conduct periodic penetration
tests against critical systems and applications.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Identifies technical vulnerabilities,
misconfigurations, and outdated software that could be exploited by
attackers, providing actionable insights for remediation.</p></li>
