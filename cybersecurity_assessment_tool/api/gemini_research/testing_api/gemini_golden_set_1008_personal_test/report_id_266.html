<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for True North Travel, synthesizing information from a network scan,
organizational security questionnaire responses, and a review of
existing identified risks. The analysis reveals several critical
vulnerabilities and significant gaps in security controls that warrant
immediate attention. Key findings include an outdated and insecure FTP
server allowing anonymous access, a lack of Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) for email access, and deficiencies in foundational security
policies and training. These issues collectively expose the organization
to a heightened risk of data breaches, unauthorized access, and
operational disruption. Urgent recommendations are provided to address
these critical findings.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-questionnaire-gaps">Analysis of
Questionnaire Gaps:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA for Email (Critical Gap):</strong> The absence of MFA
for email access is a severe vulnerability. Email is a primary vector
for phishing, business email compromise (BEC), and credential theft.
Without MFA, compromised email credentials can grant attackers broad
access to organizational communications and potentially other
systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Employee Acceptable Use Policy (High Gap):</strong> A
lack of an acceptable use policy leaves the organization exposed to
risks from misuse of company assets, data leakage, and legal
liabilities. It is fundamental for setting clear expectations for
employee behavior regarding IT resources.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Security Awareness Training for New Employees (High
Gap):</strong> Failing to provide security awareness training to new
employees at onboarding is a significant oversight. New hires are often
prime targets for social engineering attacks as they learn the ropes and
may not be familiar with organizational security protocols.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results-nmap-analysis">Technical Scan Results
(Nmap Analysis)</h1>
<p>A network scan targeting <code>10.0.0.15</code> (Internal IP)
revealed the following open ports and services. The scan date was not
explicitly provided in the metadata.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP:</strong> <code>10.0.0.15</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> Up</p></li>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="port-21---ftp-service-findings">Port 21 - FTP
Service Findings:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port ID:</strong> 21</p></li>
<li><p><strong>State:</strong> Open</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Service Name:</strong> ftp</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Product:</strong> vsftpd</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Version:</strong> 2.3.4</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scripts Output:</strong> Anonymous FTP login
allowed</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="technical-analysis">Technical Analysis:</h2>
<p>The discovery of an open FTP service running
<code>vsftpd 2.3.4</code> with anonymous login enabled presents a
critical security vulnerability.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Outdated Software (Critical Vulnerability):</strong>
<code>vsftpd 2.3.4</code> was released in 2011 and has reached
end-of-life. It is known to contain severe vulnerabilities, most notably
CVE-2011-2523 (the vsftpd backdoor vulnerability), which allows remote
code execution. Running such outdated software significantly increases
the risk of system compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Anonymous FTP Access (Critical
Misconfiguration):</strong> Allowing anonymous FTP access is a severe
security misconfiguration. It enables any unauthorized user to connect
to the FTP server without credentials, potentially allowing for data
exfiltration, unauthorized file uploads (malware hosting), or
information gathering about the network’s structure.</p></li>
