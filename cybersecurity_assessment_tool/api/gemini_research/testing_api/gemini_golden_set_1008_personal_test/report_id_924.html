<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This document presents a cybersecurity posture assessment for Moxie
Marketing. The analysis draws upon organizational security questionnaire
responses, with the aim of identifying strengths, weaknesses, and
potential risks. Due to issues with the provided technical scan data and
pre-existing risk information, a full technical vulnerability assessment
and a comprehensive review of historical risks could not be completed.
The focus of this report is therefore primarily on the organizational
and policy-level controls that could be adequately assessed.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following details were provided regarding Moxie Marketing:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Organization Name:</strong> Moxie Marketing</p></li>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A review of the provided security questionnaire responses reveals the
current status of several key security controls within Moxie Marketing.
The symbol indicates a ’Yes’ response, signifying the control is in
place, while indicates a ’No’ response, highlighting a potential
gap.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>The provided network scan data
(<code>Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON</code>) was incomplete and broken,
preventing a technical analysis of external-facing systems. Therefore,
no findings regarding open ports, service versions, or potential
software vulnerabilities can be included in this report. A comprehensive
assessment of external technical posture requires functional scan data
targeting <code>[Target IP]</code>.</p>

Data Availability</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not available.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Identified Products &amp; Versions:</strong> Not
available.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Vulnerabilities Identified:</strong> Not

<p>Without this crucial data, the technical security posture remains
largely unknown and unassessed in this report.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the available information from the security control review,
several key risks have been identified. It is important to note that the
provided data for pre-existing vulnerabilities
(<code>Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON</code>) was broken, thus no historical
risk context could be incorporated. The risks outlined below are derived
solely from the questionnaire responses.</p>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Inadequate MFA for Email</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The absence of Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) for email access significantly increases the risk of account
compromise through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force
attacks. Compromised email accounts can lead to business email
compromise (BEC), data breaches, and unauthorized system access.</td>

<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Insufficient Annual Security Awareness
Training</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Failing to conduct security awareness
training for all employees at least once per year leaves the
organization susceptible to evolving social engineering tactics and new
cyber threats. Employees are often the first line of defense, and
outdated knowledge increases human error vulnerability.</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">Medium</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Unassessed Technical Vulnerabilities</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Due to unavailable technical scan data,
the external-facing attack surface of Moxie Marketing could not be
assessed for vulnerabilities, configuration weaknesses, or outdated
software. This represents an unknown risk that could be
significant.</td>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and improve Moxie Marketing’s
cybersecurity posture, the following recommendations are provided:</p>
<h2
id="implement-multi-factor-authentication-mfa-for-email-high-priority">Implement
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email (High Priority)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediately deploy and enforce MFA for
all user accounts accessing email services.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rationale:</strong> MFA is one of the most effective
controls against credential compromise, significantly reducing the
success rate of phishing and password-based attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Details:</strong> Choose a robust MFA solution (e.g.,
authenticator apps, FIDO2 security keys) over less secure methods like
SMS-based MFA where possible. Ensure all employees are trained on its
use.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2
id="establish-regular-mandatory-security-awareness-training-medium-priority">Establish
Regular, Mandatory Security Awareness Training (Medium Priority)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop and implement a mandatory annual
security awareness training program for all employees.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Continuous training ensures employees
are up-to-date with current threat landscapes, common attack vectors
(e.g., phishing, ransomware), and best practices for data protection and
incident reporting.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Details:</strong> Training should be engaging, cover
relevant topics, and include simulated phishing exercises to test and
reinforce learning. Document employee participation.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2
id="conduct-a-comprehensive-technical-vulnerability-assessment-high-priority">Conduct
a Comprehensive Technical Vulnerability Assessment (High Priority)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Provide complete and valid network scan
data for a target system to enable a proper technical vulnerability
assessment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Without a technical scan, unknown
vulnerabilities on external-facing assets cannot be identified and
remediated, leaving the organization exposed to potential
exploits.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Details:</strong> Ensure the provided data includes
details on open ports, services, product versions, and any detected
vulnerabilities. This will allow for a detailed analysis of the attack
surface.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>This cybersecurity posture assessment has highlighted critical
organizational gaps related to MFA for email and annual security
awareness training. While the presence of MFA for computers and
sensitive data systems, along with an acceptable use policy and new
employee training, are positive aspects, the identified weaknesses pose
significant risks to Moxie Marketing. Furthermore, the inability to
conduct a technical vulnerability assessment due to incomplete data
leaves a major area of risk unaddressed. Addressing these identified
organizational risks and facilitating a comprehensive technical
assessment are crucial next steps for strengthening Moxie Marketing’s
overall cybersecurity resilience.</p>
