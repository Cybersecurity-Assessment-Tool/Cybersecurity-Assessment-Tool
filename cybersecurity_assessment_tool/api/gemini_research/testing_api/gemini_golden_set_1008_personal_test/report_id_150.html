<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive assessment of <strong>Velocity
Ventures</strong>’s current cybersecurity posture, based on a recent
network scan, organizational security questionnaire responses, and a
review of pre-existing risk information.</p>
<p>The assessment reveals several areas of strength, particularly the
implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and
computer logins, and initial security awareness training for new
employees. Furthermore, the recent network scan of the internal target
<code>192.168.0.5</code> identified no open ports, which is a positive
technical finding, indicating a potentially hardened perimeter or
internal system.</p>
<p>However, several critical gaps and areas for improvement were
identified. <strong>Velocity Ventures</strong> currently lacks MFA for
access to sensitive data systems, an employee acceptable use policy, and
regular annual security awareness training for all employees. These
deficiencies significantly increase the organization’s exposure to
insider threats, data breaches, and social engineering attacks. A
previously identified risk regarding an "Unencrypted Web Server" was
also noted; however, the recent scan did not confirm an actively open
port 80 for the scanned target.</p>
<p>Addressing the identified policy and training gaps, alongside
ensuring robust technical controls, is paramount to enhancing
<strong>Velocity Ventures</strong>’s overall security posture and
mitigating potential risks effectively.</p>

<p><em>Note on "Unencrypted Web Server": While this risk was identified
in prior assessments, the recent network scan indicated that Port 80 on
<code>192.168.0.5</code> is currently closed. This suggests the risk may
have been mitigated or applies to a different asset. However, it is
included here as a known historical vulnerability for
awareness.</em></p>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To enhance <strong>Velocity Ventures</strong>’s cybersecurity
posture, the following recommendations are provided:</p>
<h2 id="policy-and-governance">Policy and Governance</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a comprehensive AUP outlining the proper use of
organizational IT resources, data, and communication systems. Ensure all
employees review and acknowledge the AUP annually. This policy should
cover areas such as internet usage, email, software installation, data
handling, and privacy.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="identity-and-access-management">Identity and Access
Management</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> Extend
the use of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to all systems that store
or process sensitive organizational data. This will significantly reduce
the risk of unauthorized access even if primary credentials are
compromised. Evaluate suitable MFA solutions that integrate with
existing sensitive data systems.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="security-awareness-and-training">Security Awareness and
Training</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Establish Annual Security Awareness Training:</strong>
Institute a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all
employees, not just new hires. This training should cover topics such as
phishing, social engineering, password hygiene, data handling best
practices, and incident reporting procedures. Regular refreshers ensure
employees are aware of evolving threats.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="technical-controls">Technical Controls</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Verify Web Server Configuration:</strong> Given the
historical risk of an "Unencrypted Web Server," conduct a thorough
internal review to confirm that any public-facing or internal web
services either operate over HTTPS with valid SSL/TLS certificates or
are intentionally kept offline/closed. If Port 80 was previously open
and is now closed, ensure this state is maintained and monitored. For
any services that require web access, prioritize secure configurations
(e.g., HTTPS, strong ciphers, regular patching).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Network Scans:</strong> Continue to perform
regular internal and external network scans to identify any new or
re-emerging vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or unexpected open
ports. This proactive measure helps maintain a current understanding of
the organization’s attack surface.</p></li>
