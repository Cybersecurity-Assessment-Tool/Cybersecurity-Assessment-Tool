<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This Cybersecurity Posture Assessment Report has been compiled to
provide Maple Leaf Logistics with a comprehensive overview of its
current security standing. The assessment integrates data from three
primary sources: an internal network scan, a security questionnaire
completed by the organization, and a register of existing
vulnerabilities. The objective is to identify security strengths,
weaknesses, and actionable recommendations to improve the organization’s
defensive capabilities.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-security-control-gaps">Analysis of Security Control
Gaps</h2>
<p>Based on the questionnaire responses, the following critical gaps
have been identified:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins:</strong> The absence of
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins significantly
increases the risk of unauthorized access. If credentials are
compromised (e.g., through phishing or malware), attackers can gain
direct access to internal systems without a second authentication
factor.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong> New hires are often the most vulnerable to social
engineering attacks due to unfamiliarity with organizational security
policies and common threat vectors. Failing to provide initial security
awareness training leaves the organization exposed to human-factor risks
from the outset of an employee’s tenure.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed targeting internal host . The scan
metadata and findings are detailed below.</p>
<ul>

<caption>Summary of Open Ports</caption>

</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<h2 id="technical-findings-analysis">Technical Findings Analysis</h2>
<p>The most significant finding from the network scan is the presence of
an open port 8080 on which, according to the ‘http-title‘ script,
displays "TOP SECRET DB". This is a critical indicator of potential
misconfiguration or exposure of sensitive information.</p>
<p>It is important to note that while existing vulnerability data (Input
3) claims "Port 8080 Secured" with a severity of 0.0, the current Nmap
scan unequivocally shows an open service advertising "TOP SECRET DB".
This directly contradicts the previous assessment and necessitates
urgent re-evaluation. The Nmap output provides empirical evidence of the
current state. The "TOP SECRET DB" title, even if only a label, suggests
a database or system containing sensitive data is accessible and
potentially mislabeled or insufficiently protected.</p>
<p>No specific service names, products, or versions were identified by
the scanner for port 8080 based on the provided data, which could
indicate a custom application or a basic HTTP server. Further
investigation is required to determine the exact service and its
underlying technology.</p>

technical scan, and existing risk data, presenting a holistic view of

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following recommendations are provided to address the identified
risks and enhance the overall cybersecurity posture of Maple Leaf
Logistics.</p>
<h2 id="immediate-actions">Immediate Actions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Investigate and Secure Port 8080 on :</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Immediately verify the actual service running on port 8080 and
its purpose.</p></li>
<li><p>Determine if the "TOP SECRET DB" title is accurate and if
sensitive data is indeed exposed or accessible.</p></li>
<li><p>If the service is not intended to be exposed, block access to
port 8080, especially from external networks.</p></li>
<li><p>If the service is legitimate and requires access, rename the HTTP
title to be less revealing, implement robust authentication (preferably
MFA), and ensure proper authorization controls are in place.</p></li>
<li><p>Update internal risk registers and documentation to reflect the
current status and security controls for this port.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="short-term-recommendations">Short-Term Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement Mandatory MFA for Computer Logins:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Evaluate and select an appropriate MFA solution compatible with
the organization’s computer systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Develop a phased rollout plan to implement mandatory MFA for all
employee computer logins.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide comprehensive training and support to employees during
the transition.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Develop or procure a comprehensive security awareness training
program specifically for new hires.</p></li>
<li><p>Make completion of this training mandatory before new employees
are granted full access to organizational systems and data.</p></li>
<li><p>Include topics such as phishing, social engineering, password
hygiene, data handling policies, and incident reporting.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="long-term-recommendations">Long-Term Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Regular Vulnerability Scanning and Penetration
Testing:</strong> Implement a routine schedule for internal and external
vulnerability scanning and periodic penetration testing to proactively
identify and address security weaknesses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Continuous Security Awareness Program
Enhancement:</strong> Continuously update and expand the annual security
awareness training for all employees, incorporating new threat
intelligence and lessons learned from internal incidents.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Security Policy Review and Enforcement:</strong>
Regularly review and update security policies, including the acceptable
use policy, to ensure they remain current and are effectively enforced
across the organization.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Maple Leaf Logistics demonstrates a foundational commitment to
security in some areas, such as MFA for email and sensitive data
systems, and annual security training. However, the identified gaps in
MFA for computer logins, new employee security training, and the
critical finding of an exposed "TOP SECRET DB" on port 8080 pose
significant risks. Addressing these critical items proactively will
substantially improve the organization’s security posture and resilience
against modern cyber threats.</p>
