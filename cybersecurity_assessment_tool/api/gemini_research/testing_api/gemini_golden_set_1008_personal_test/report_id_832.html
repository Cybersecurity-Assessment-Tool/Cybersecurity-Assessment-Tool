<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of <strong>Astraeus
Aerospace</strong>, based on a review of organizational data, a security
questionnaire, and technical network scan results. The assessment
reveals a generally positive technical footprint with no open ports
identified on the scanned internal target, but highlights significant
gaps in foundational security controls, particularly concerning
multi-factor authentication (MFA) implementation for critical systems
and the frequency of security awareness training. These deficiencies
introduce considerable risk to the organization’s data and operations.
Immediate action is recommended to implement comprehensive MFA and
enhance security training programs.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-questionnaire-responses">Analysis of Questionnaire
Responses</h2>
<p>The questionnaire highlights several critical areas requiring
attention:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA for Email Access:</strong> The lack of Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for email access is a significant vulnerability.
Phishing and credential stuffing attacks could easily compromise email
accounts, leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, or further
network penetration.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> Failure to
enforce MFA for systems containing sensitive data exposes critical
assets to unauthorized access, increasing the risk of data loss,
compliance violations, and severe reputational damage.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Annual Security Awareness Training:</strong> While new
employees receive security training, the absence of annual refresher
training for all employees means that critical security knowledge may
not be reinforced or updated regularly. This leaves the organization
susceptible to evolving threats and social engineering tactics.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on the specified target to identify open
ports and services, providing an initial technical view of the network’s
exposure.</p>
<h2 id="scan-details">Scan Details</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Target:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Utilized:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="findings">Findings</h2>
<p>The Nmap scan indicated that the target host () was
<strong>up</strong>. However, no open ports were discovered during the
scan, and all extra ports were reported as closed.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> Up</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports Found:</strong> None</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Services Identified:</strong> None</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="technical-analysis">Technical Analysis</h3>
<p>The absence of open ports on the scanned target is a positive
finding, suggesting a strong perimeter defense or that the scanned host
is not intended to provide network services accessible from the scanning
point. This significantly reduces the attack surface from externally
exploitable services. Without open ports or identified services, no
specific vulnerabilities related to outdated software versions or
dangerous configurations could be identified through this scan
alone.</p>

<p>This section synthesizes the findings from the security control
review and technical scan into an assessment of the organization’s
current risk posture.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and enhance the overall cybersecurity
posture of <strong>Astraeus Aerospace</strong>, the following
recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email
Access:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Mandate the use of MFA for all email accounts
across the organization. Implement a robust MFA solution that supports
various authentication methods (e.g., authenticator apps, hardware
tokens).</p></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Significantly reduces the risk of email account
compromise, even if passwords are stolen, by adding an essential layer
of security.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive
Data Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Extend MFA requirements to all systems that
store, process, or transmit sensitive organizational data (e.g., CRM,
ERP, HR systems, critical databases).</p></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Provides an additional, strong layer of
security, protecting critical data from unauthorized access and helping
meet compliance requirements.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Mandatory Annual Security Awareness Training
for All Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Develop and implement a mandatory annual
security awareness training program for all employees. This training
should cover current threats (e.g., phishing, ransomware), best
practices for data handling, and organizational security
policies.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Enhances the human firewall, empowering
employees to recognize, avoid, and report potential cyber threats,
thereby reducing the risk of successful social engineering attacks and
human error-induced breaches.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Maintain Strong Network Perimeter and Conduct Regular
Scans:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Continue to regularly review and update firewall
rules and network configurations to ensure that only necessary ports are
open and legitimate services are exposed. Conduct periodic internal and
external vulnerability scans and penetration tests to proactively
identify and address potential weaknesses.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Keeps the external and internal attack surface
minimal, limiting entry points for potential attackers and providing
ongoing assurance of network security.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>While the technical scan revealed a clean external footprint for the
specified target, the organizational security questionnaire exposed
critical gaps in <strong>Astraeus Aerospace</strong>’s foundational
security controls. The absence of comprehensive Multi-Factor
Authentication for email and sensitive data systems, coupled with
inadequate annual security awareness training, represents significant
vulnerabilities that could be exploited by adversaries. Addressing these
core issues through the recommended actions will substantially
strengthen the organization’s defense against cyber threats and improve
its overall security posture.</p>
