<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This cybersecurity assessment was conducted for Cloud Nine Software
to evaluate its current security posture. The assessment synthesized
data from a network vulnerability scan, a comprehensive security
questionnaire, and a review of documented organizational risks.</p>
<p>The network scan of the internal target <code>192.168.1.100</code>
indicated no open ports, suggesting a well-secured internal host or an
unserviceable target from the scan perspective. However, a significant
number of critical security policy and control gaps were identified
through the organizational questionnaire. Key findings include the lack
of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and sensitive
data access, the absence of an Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), and
a complete deficiency in security awareness training programs for both
new and existing employees. No pre-existing vulnerabilities were
documented.</p>
<p>These internal gaps present substantial risks, potentially leading to
unauthorized access, data breaches, and non-compliance. Immediate
recommendations focus on implementing MFA across all critical access
points, establishing foundational security policies like an AUP, and
initiating mandatory security awareness training programs. Adhering to
these recommendations will significantly bolster Cloud Nine Software’s
defense mechanisms against common cyber threats.</p>

<p>A network scan was performed on the target

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not provided in scan
metadata.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>192.168.1.100</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Status:</strong> Host is reported as ’up’.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports Found:</strong> None. The scan indicated that
no open ports were detected on the target <code>192.168.1.100</code>,
with all extra ports explicitly marked as ’closed’. This suggests that
the scanned host is either tightly secured against external access for
common services or is not running any services on standard ports visible
to the scanner.</p></li>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the security questionnaire, the following
critical risks and gaps in security posture have been identified. No
technical vulnerabilities were found via the network scan, and no

proper and acceptable use of company IT resources, data, and internet
access. Distribute it to all employees and require
acknowledgment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Establishes clear guidelines for
employees, reduces misuse of company resources, and mitigates insider
risks.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Mandatory Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Integrate mandatory security awareness
training as part of the onboarding process for all new hires.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Ensures that new employees are
immediately educated on security best practices, recognizing threats,
and company policies from their first day.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Annual Security Awareness Training for All
Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Conduct mandatory annual (or more
frequent) security awareness training sessions for all employees to
refresh knowledge and update them on new threats and policies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Keeps the entire workforce informed
about current cyber threats (e.g., advanced phishing techniques,
ransomware), reinforces good security habits, and fosters a
security-conscious culture.</p></li>
