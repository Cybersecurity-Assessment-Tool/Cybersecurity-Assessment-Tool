<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for Bluebird Bio, based on an analysis of provided organizational data,
network scan results, and existing risk registers. The assessment
reveals a generally positive stance on multi-factor authentication
implementation and employee policy. However, critical gaps were
identified regarding annual security awareness training for all
employees, and a high-risk finding of an exposed MySQL database service
(port 3306) accessible on the network. Furthermore, the MySQL version in
use is nearing its End-of-Extended-Support, posing future vulnerability
risks. Urgent recommendations include implementing strict firewall rules
for the database, establishing mandatory annual security awareness
training, and planning for a timely MySQL version upgrade. Addressing
these findings will significantly enhance Bluebird Bio’s overall
security resilience.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-questionnaire-findings">Analysis
of Questionnaire Findings</h2>
<p>The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) across critical access points and has established
an acceptable use policy and initial security awareness training for new
employees. However, a significant gap exists in the lack of annual
security awareness training for <em>all</em> employees. This exposes the
organization to increased risks from social engineering, phishing, and
other human-factor vulnerabilities, as employee knowledge of current
threats and best practices may degrade over time.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An Nmap network scan was performed to identify open ports and
services on a specified target.</p>

<p>The scan identified the following open port and service:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port</strong>: 3306/tcp</p></li>
<li><p><strong>State</strong>: Open</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Service</strong>: mysql</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Product</strong>: MySQL</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Version</strong>: 5.7.33</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of
Technical Findings</h2>
<p>The presence of an open MySQL database service (port 3306) is a
critical finding. An open database port, particularly without stringent
access controls, represents a significant attack surface for potential
data breaches, unauthorized access, or denial-of-service attacks.</p>
<p>Furthermore, MySQL version 5.7.33, while currently under extended
support for security fixes, is an older major release. Its extended
support is scheduled to end in October 2023. This proximity to
End-of-Life (EOL) poses a future risk, as continued use beyond this date
would mean no further security patches, leaving the system vulnerable to
newly discovered exploits. Planning for an upgrade to MySQL 8.0 or newer
is essential.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and enhance Bluebird Bio’s
cybersecurity posture, the following actionable recommendations are
provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Mitigate Database Exposure on :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement Strict Firewall Rules:</strong> Immediately
restrict access to MySQL port 3306 (172.16.50.20:3306) to only
necessary, trusted internal hosts. Ideally, database servers should
reside in a segmented network zone with tightly controlled
ingress/egress.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Secure Administrative Access:</strong> For any required
remote administrative access, mandate the use of a Virtual Private
Network (VPN) or other secure tunneling methods, rather than direct
network access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Review and Strengthen Credentials:</strong> Ensure
strong, unique, and complex passwords are used for all database user
accounts. Disable or remove any default or unnecessary accounts.
Regularly rotate database credentials.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Mandatory Annual Security Awareness
Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Deliver Program:</strong> Establish a
comprehensive and mandatory annual security awareness training program
for <u>all</u> employees, regardless of their tenure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cover Key Topics:</strong> Training should cover current
threat landscapes, including but not limited to phishing, social
engineering tactics, strong password practices, secure data handling,
incident reporting procedures, and the risks associated with public
Wi-Fi.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Reinforcement:</strong> Supplement annual
training with regular security updates, reminders, and simulated
phishing exercises to keep security top-of-mind.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Plan for MySQL Version Upgrade:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Initiate Upgrade Project:</strong> Begin planning and
execute a project to upgrade MySQL 5.7.33 to the latest stable major
version (e.g., MySQL 8.0) well before its End-of-Extended-Support date
of October 2023.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Thorough Testing:</strong> Conduct extensive
compatibility and performance testing in a staging or development
environment prior to deployment in production to minimize service
disruption.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Maintain Patching Schedule:</strong> Establish a regular
patching schedule to ensure the upgraded MySQL instance remains
up-to-date with the latest security fixes and minor releases.</p></li>
</ul></li>
