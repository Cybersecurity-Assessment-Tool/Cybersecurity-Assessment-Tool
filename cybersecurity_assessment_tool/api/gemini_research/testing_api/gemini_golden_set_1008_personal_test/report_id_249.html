<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for Aeon Pharmaceuticals, synthesizing findings from an external network
scan, a security control questionnaire, and a review of existing risk
data. The analysis reveals several critical vulnerabilities and
significant gaps in security controls, primarily concerning multi-factor
authentication (MFA) implementation, security awareness training, and
policy enforcement.</p>
<p>A particularly alarming finding is the discovery of an open port 8080
on the target system <code>10.5.5.5</code>, explicitly identified via
its HTTP title as "TOP SECRET DB." This direct exposure of what appears
to be a sensitive data system critically contradicts the organization’s
existing risk assessment, which incorrectly lists Port 8080 as
"confirmed secure and false positive." This exposure represents an
immediate and severe risk of unauthorized data access or system
compromise.</p>
<p>Combined with identified deficiencies in MFA for email and sensitive
data systems, absence of an Acceptable Use Policy, and lack of annual
security awareness training, Aeon Pharmaceuticals’ security posture is
significantly weakened. Immediate action is imperative to address these
critical findings and bolster the organization’s defenses against
current cyber threats.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="key-gaps-identified-from-questionnaire">2.1
Key Gaps Identified from Questionnaire:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Email Access:</strong> The absence of
Multi-Factor Authentication for email access dramatically increases the
risk of account compromise through phishing, credential stuffing, or
brute-force attacks. Such compromises can lead to Business Email
Compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, or broader network
intrusion.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> Failure
to implement MFA for sensitive data systems represents a direct and
critical risk of unauthorized access to confidential information. This
significantly elevates the likelihood and impact of a data
breach.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong>
Without a formal AUP, employees may be unaware of proper conduct
regarding organizational IT resources, data, and communication systems.
This lack of clear guidelines can lead to data leakage, misuse of
company assets, and inadvertent introduction of malware.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Annual Security Awareness Training:</strong> While new
employees receive initial training, the lack of annual refreshers means
that employee awareness of evolving cyber threats, best practices, and
organizational policies may become outdated. This increases
susceptibility to social engineering attacks, phishing, and other
human-factor vulnerabilities.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">3. Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed targeting
<code>10.5.5.5</code>. The scan identified the following open port and
service information:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target Host:</strong> <code>10.5.5.5</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> N/A (Specific scan date not provided
in metadata)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports and Services:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 8080/tcp:</strong> Open</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Service/Product:</strong> HTTP (inferred from
<code>http-title</code> script output)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Version:</strong> N/A</p></li>
<li><p><strong>HTTP Title:</strong> “TOP SECRET DB”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Details:</strong> This port is commonly used for web
applications, often exposing administrative interfaces, development
environments, or less critical services. However, the HTTP title “TOP
SECRET DB” is highly alarming. It strongly suggests that a sensitive
database or application containing critical information is directly
accessible over HTTP on a non-standard port, potentially without
adequate authentication, authorization, or encryption. This represents a
severe information disclosure and access risk.</p></li>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">5. Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the comprehensive assessment, the following actionable
recommendations are provided to mitigate identified risks and
substantially enhance Aeon Pharmaceuticals’ cybersecurity posture:</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="immediate-critical-actions">5.1 Immediate
Critical Actions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Investigate and Secure Exposed System on Port
8080:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Immediately investigate the system exposed on . Determine its
exact purpose, the nature of data it stores, and current access
controls.</p></li>
<li><p>If it is indeed a sensitive database or application, immediately
restrict all external access. Implement stringent firewall rules to
permit access only from authorized internal networks or via a secure,
authenticated gateway (e.g., VPN).</p></li>
<li><p>Remove the highly sensitive "TOP SECRET DB" title from public
visibility if it’s not intended to be exposed.</p></li>
<li><p>For any legitimate web interface, implement strong authentication
mechanisms, including Multi-Factor Authentication, and ensure all
communication is encrypted (HTTPS).</p></li>
<li><p>Formally re-evaluate and update the prior risk assessment that
deemed this port "secure and false positive," clearly documenting the
new critical finding.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Prioritize the deployment and enforcement of Multi-Factor
Authentication for all systems that process, store, or transmit
sensitive organizational data. This is a critical control to protect
against unauthorized access even if primary credentials are
compromised.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="high-priority-actions">5.2 High Priority
Actions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Access:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication for all employee and
administrative email accounts within the organization. This will
significantly reduce the risk of email account compromise and subsequent
attacks like BEC.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy that
clearly outlines proper and improper use of all organizational IT
resources, data, internet access, and communication systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Distribute the AUP to all employees, obtain signed
acknowledgments, and integrate AUP review into new hire onboarding and
annual security awareness training.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="medium-priority-actions">5.3 Medium Priority
Actions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Establish Annual Security Awareness Training
Program:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and implement a mandatory annual security awareness
training program for all employees. This training should be updated
regularly to cover current cyber threats (e.g., advanced phishing
techniques, ransomware, social engineering) and reinforce organizational
policies and best practices.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct regular simulated phishing exercises to test and
reinforce employee awareness and provide targeted education.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Aeon Pharmaceuticals currently faces significant cybersecurity
challenges, highlighted by critical exposures such as the "TOP SECRET
DB" on port 8080 and widespread gaps in Multi-Factor Authentication
implementation. These issues, combined with deficiencies in security
policies and training, create a substantial attack surface. Addressing
these findings with utmost urgency, beginning with the immediate
critical recommendations, will be essential to substantially enhance the
organization’s defense against modern cyber threats and protect its
valuable assets. A proactive, adaptive, and continuous approach to
security is paramount for maintaining a resilient cybersecurity
posture.</p>
