<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for <strong>Grizzly Peak</strong>, based on a review of organizational
security controls, an analysis of network scan data, and an assessment
of existing risks. The evaluation highlights critical areas for
improvement, particularly regarding multi-factor authentication (MFA)
enforcement and new employee security awareness training.</p>
<p>While the provided network scan data was empty, preventing a detailed
technical vulnerability assessment, significant gaps were identified
through the security questionnaire. The organization currently does not
enforce MFA for computer logins and lacks dedicated security awareness
training for new employees. These deficiencies represent high-severity
risks that could significantly impact the organization’s security
posture if not addressed.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>Below are the key organizational details gathered for this
assessment:</p>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>The provided network scan data for target <code>[Target IP]</code>
indicated an empty ‘scans‘ array. This means no open ports, services, or
version information was detected or available from the scan. Without
specific findings, a detailed technical vulnerability assessment cannot
be performed from this input. It is crucial to ensure that network scans
are conducted regularly and thoroughly to identify potential external
attack vectors.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the security control review, the following high-severity
risks have been identified. The provided existing vulnerabilities data
(‘Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON‘) was empty, therefore all identified risks
originate from the questionnaire analysis.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and enhance <strong>Grizzly
Peak</strong>’s cybersecurity posture, the following actionable
recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for All
Computer Logins:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Enforce MFA for all user accounts
accessing organizational computers, including workstations and
servers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Significantly reduces the risk of
credential compromise and unauthorized system access, even if passwords
are stolen or guessed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> Immediate.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Mandatory Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Integrate comprehensive security
awareness training into the onboarding process for all new employees.
This training should cover topics such as phishing, social engineering,
password hygiene, data handling policies, and incident reporting
procedures.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Ensures that all employees, from day
one, understand their role in maintaining organizational security and
are equipped to identify and report potential threats.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> Immediate.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Regular and Comprehensive Network
Scans:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Schedule and execute regular,
authenticated network vulnerability scans of both internal and external
assets. Ensure that the scan results are fully captured and
analyzed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Provides continuous visibility into the
organization’s attack surface, identifies newly exposed services,
outdated software, and misconfigurations that could be exploited by
attackers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> High (Foundational).</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p><strong>Grizzly Peak</strong>’s cybersecurity posture, while
demonstrating strengths in some areas like MFA for sensitive data and
annual security training, has critical gaps that require immediate
attention. The absence of MFA for computer logins and the lack of
security awareness training for new employees pose significant risks
that could be exploited. Addressing these areas, alongside implementing
a robust network scanning regime, will substantially strengthen the
organization’s defenses against evolving cyber threats. Continuous
monitoring, regular assessments, and a proactive approach to security
are vital for maintaining a resilient cybersecurity posture.</p>
