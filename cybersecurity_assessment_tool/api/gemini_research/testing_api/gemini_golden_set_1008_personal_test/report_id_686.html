<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings from a cybersecurity posture
assessment for <strong>Crestview Analytics</strong>. The assessment
involved a technical network scan, a review of organizational security
controls via questionnaire, and an analysis of pre-existing identified
risks.</p>
<p>Key findings reveal critical vulnerabilities, including an outdated
FTP service with anonymous access enabled, representing a severe risk of
unauthorized access and data compromise. Furthermore, there are
significant gaps in foundational security practices, such as the
widespread absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for critical
systems like email and computer logins, and a general lack of
comprehensive security policies and awareness training.</p>
<p>Collectively, these issues expose <strong>Crestview
Analytics</strong> to a high level of risk from various cyber threats
including data breaches, account compromises, and social engineering
attacks. Urgent and strategic recommendations are provided to address
these critical findings and bolster the organization’s cybersecurity
defenses.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-questionnaire-gaps">Analysis of
Questionnaire Gaps</h2>
<p>The questionnaire responses reveal several critical gaps in the
organization’s security posture:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Inadequate Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Implementation:</strong> The absence of MFA for email and general
computer logins significantly increases the risk of account compromise
through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks, as a
single compromised password can grant unauthorized access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> Without
a formal AUP, employees may not be fully aware of their responsibilities
and appropriate usage of company IT assets, potentially leading to
misuse, data leakage, and security incidents.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Insufficient Security Awareness Training:</strong> The
lack of both initial (for new employees) and recurring (annual) security
awareness training leaves the entire workforce vulnerable to various
social engineering attacks, phishing campaigns, and malware, increasing
the human-factor risk.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on the internal target . The scan
identified the following open ports and services:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not specified in the provided
metadata.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Target IP:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Port 21/TCP (FTP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Service:</strong> FTP (<code>ftp</code>)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Product:</strong> <code>vsftpd</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Version:</strong> <code>2.3.4</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Script Output:</strong>
<code>ftp-anon: Anonymous FTP login allowed</code></p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="technical-analysis">Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>The network scan revealed a critical security vulnerability:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Outdated FTP Service with Anonymous Access:</strong> The
presence of an FTP service running <code>vsftpd 2.3.4</code> is highly
concerning. This version was released in 2011 and is known to have
multiple severe vulnerabilities, including a critical backdoor
(CVE-2011-2523) that allows arbitrary command execution.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Anonymous FTP Access Enabled:</strong> Further
compounding the risk, the service explicitly allows anonymous login.
This means any unauthorized individual can connect to the FTP server
without credentials, potentially gaining access to sensitive files,
uploading malicious content, or leveraging the outdated software’s
vulnerabilities for deeper system compromise. This represents an
immediate and critical threat to data confidentiality, integrity, and
system availability.</p></li>

technical scan, and pre-existing risks into a comprehensive risk
