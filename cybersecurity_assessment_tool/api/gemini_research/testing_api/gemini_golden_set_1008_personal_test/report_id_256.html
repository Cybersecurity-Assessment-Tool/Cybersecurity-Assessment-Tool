<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for Great Lakes. The assessment incorporated organizational security
questionnaire responses, an external network scan, and a review of
existing vulnerability data. While the organization demonstrates strong
adherence to Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across key access points,
critical gaps were identified in foundational security policies and
ongoing employee security awareness training. These areas present
significant risks to the overall security posture. The network scan of
the target <code>192.168.1.100</code> indicated no open ports,
suggesting a well-hardened or filtered system from the perspective of
this scan. No pre-existing vulnerabilities were provided for review.
Addressing the identified policy and training gaps is crucial for
enhancing the organization’s overall resilience against cyber
threats.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>An Nmap network scan was conducted on the target
<code>192.168.1.100</code> to identify open ports, running services, and
potential misconfigurations.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="nmap-scan-details">Nmap Scan Details</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>192.168.1.100</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> The target host was identified as
<code>up</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports Identified:</strong> None. The scan indicated
that all common ports are either closed or filtered
(<code>extraports_state: closed</code>).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Identified Services/Products/Versions:</strong> No
services were identified due to the absence of open ports.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The absence of open ports on the scanned target from this perspective
suggests a well-secured system or network, potentially behind a
restrictive firewall, effectively limiting its external attack surface.
No direct technical vulnerabilities were identified through this
specific scan.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the provided data, the following
high-priority risks have been identified primarily from the security
questionnaire responses. No technical vulnerabilities were found via the
provided scan, and no existing vulnerabilities were provided for
review.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and strengthen the overall
cybersecurity posture, the following actionable recommendations are
provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement a Comprehensive Acceptable Use
Policy (AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Draft and formalize a clear, concise AUP that defines acceptable
and unacceptable use of all organizational IT resources, including
hardware, software, network access, and data.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all employees formally acknowledge and sign the AUP upon
hiring and annually thereafter.</p></li>
<li><p>Integrate AUP principles into all employee onboarding and
security awareness training programs.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Mandatory Annual Security Awareness Training
for All Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement a recurring, mandatory security awareness training
program for all employees (not just new hires) at least once per
year.</p></li>
<li><p>Training content should be engaging, relevant to current threats
(e.g., advanced phishing, ransomware), and cover key topics such as data
protection, incident reporting procedures, and the importance of
adhering to the AUP.</p></li>
<li><p>Track completion rates and conduct periodic assessments (e.g.,
simulated phishing campaigns) to gauge effectiveness and identify areas
for improvement.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Maintain and Enhance Proactive Network Hardening
Measures:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Continue to enforce strict firewall rules and implement network
segmentation to minimize the attack surface and contain potential
breaches.</p></li>
<li><p>Regularly review and update network configurations, and consider
periodic vulnerability assessments and penetration testing on all
critical systems, including both external and internal assets, to
proactively identify and remediate weaknesses.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Great Lakes has demonstrated a commendable commitment to implementing
Multi-Factor Authentication, which is a critical control against
credential theft. However, the identified deficiencies in establishing a
formal Acceptable Use Policy and providing continuous, organization-wide
security awareness training represent significant human and
governance-related risks. Addressing these foundational elements is
paramount to fostering a robust security culture and significantly
enhancing the organization’s overall resilience against the evolving
landscape of cyber threats. A commitment to continuous improvement
across all facets of cybersecurity will be key to long-term
protection.</p>
