<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of <strong>Aetheric
Systems</strong> based on a recent network scan, self-reported
organizational data, and an existing risk register. The assessment
highlights a mixed security landscape with both strengths and
significant areas for improvement.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strengths:</strong> The organization demonstrates
foundational security practices by implementing Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems and conducting
initial security awareness training for new employees.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Key Gaps:</strong> Critical deficiencies include the lack
of MFA for computer logins, the absence of a formal Employee Acceptable
Use Policy (AUP), and the failure to conduct annual security awareness
training for all employees. These policy and training gaps represent
significant human-factor risks that could be exploited.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Technical Vulnerabilities:</strong> A critical finding is
the exposure of a localhost service on <code>127.0.0.1</code>,
specifically port 22 (SSH), which is also present in the organization’s
existing risk register with a CVSS score of 10.0. This indicates a
severe risk requiring immediate remediation to prevent potential
unauthorized access or system compromise.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, while some essential controls are in place, <strong>Aetheric
Systems</strong> faces significant risks due to policy oversights and a
critical technical vulnerability. Immediate action on the identified
recommendations is crucial to strengthen defenses and improve overall
resilience against cyber threats.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed to identify open ports and services on
specified targets. This analysis focuses on the findings relevant to the
organization’s internal and external posture.</p>
<h2 id="nmap-scan-findings">Nmap Scan Findings</h2>
<p>The following details were identified during the Nmap scan:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Target:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> (Not explicitly provided in scan
metadata)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> The host <code>127.0.0.1</code> was
found to be <code>up</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports and Services:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 22/tcp:</strong> State: <code>open</code></p></li>
<li><p><em>Note:</em> No specific service name, product, or version
information was identified for port 22 during this scan. This indicates
that a basic port scan was likely performed without comprehensive
service detection. If SSH is intended to be running, further
investigation into its configuration and version is warranted.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The presence of an open SSH port (22) on <code>127.0.0.1</code> is a
critical finding, especially when correlated with the existing risk
register which identifies this as a significant vulnerability.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of security controls, technical findings, and
identified risks, the following actionable recommendations are provided
to enhance <strong>Aetheric Systems</strong>’ cybersecurity posture:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer
Logins:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Mandate and enforce MFA for all user and
administrative logins to company workstations, laptops, and
servers.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
access even if primary credentials (username/password) are compromised
through phishing or brute-force attacks.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Create a comprehensive AUP that clearly outlines
the proper and prohibited use of company IT resources, data, and
internet access. Ensure all employees read, understand, and formally
acknowledge the policy upon hiring and annually thereafter.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Establishes clear expectations for employee
conduct, helps mitigate insider threats, and provides a legal framework
for policy enforcement and disciplinary actions.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Mandatory Annual Security Awareness Training
for All Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Implement a mandatory, annual security awareness
training program for all employees. This training should cover current
threats such as phishing, social engineering, ransomware, secure
password practices, and proper data handling.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Enhances employee vigilance, educates staff on
evolving cyber threats, reduces the likelihood of successful
human-factor attacks, and fosters a strong security-conscious culture
within the organization.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Address Localhost Exposure (Port 22 on ):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action (Immediate):</em> Investigate why port 22 (SSH) is
open on and determine if this service is genuinely necessary for
operational purposes. If not, disable the service or uninstall the SSH
daemon.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Action (If necessary):</em> If SSH must remain accessible
(even if only locally), ensure it is configured with the strongest
possible security practices:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Disable password authentication entirely; use SSH keys
exclusively for authentication.</p></li>
<li><p>Restrict access to specific trusted user accounts and, if
applicable, specific trusted source IP addresses within the local
network.</p></li>
<li><p>Use strong, unique passphrases for all SSH keys.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure the SSH daemon (sshd) software is updated to the latest
stable and secure version.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement robust logging and monitoring for all SSH access
attempts and activities.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider changing the default SSH port (22) to a non-standard
port (while not a security fix, it reduces automated scanning
noise).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Mitigates a critical vulnerability (CVSS 10.0)
that could lead to unauthorized remote access, command execution, and
severe system compromise.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Regular Vulnerability Scanning and Penetration
Testing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Implement a schedule for regular internal and
external vulnerability scanning and periodic penetration testing. This
should include authenticated scans to detect vulnerabilities within
operating systems and applications.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Proactively identifies new vulnerabilities,
misconfigurations, and assesses the effectiveness of existing security
controls before they can be exploited by malicious actors.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p><strong>Aetheric Systems</strong> has demonstrated efforts in certain
critical areas of cybersecurity, notably with the implementation of MFA
for sensitive systems and initial employee training. However, the
assessment reveals significant gaps in fundamental security hygiene,
including the lack of multi-factor authentication for computer access,
essential policy documentation (Acceptable Use Policy), and ongoing,
mandatory security awareness training. Furthermore, the critical
technical vulnerability of an exposed localhost service underscores the
immediate need for robust technical remediation. Addressing these
identified risks and implementing the provided recommendations will
substantially improve the organization’s resilience against prevalent
cyber threats and significantly enhance its overall security posture.
Continuous monitoring and adaptation to the evolving threat landscape
are vital for long-term security.</p>
