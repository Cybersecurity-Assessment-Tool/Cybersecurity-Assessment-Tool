<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a cybersecurity posture assessment for Nova
Terra, based on a review of organizational data, security questionnaire
responses, and a limited network scan. The assessment reveals several
critical areas requiring immediate attention, particularly concerning
the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer
logins, and significant gaps in foundational security practices such as
an Acceptable Use Policy and initial security awareness training for new
employees. While the provided network scan on the target
<code>192.168.1.100</code> indicated no open ports, the identified
internal control weaknesses present considerable risks that could expose
the organization to various cyber threats.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on the target
<code>192.168.1.100</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scanner:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Target:</strong> <code>192.168.1.100</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> N/A (not provided in scan
metadata)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Findings:</strong> The scan indicated that the host
<code>192.168.1.100</code> was operational (<em>status: up</em>), but no
open ports were detected. The <code>extraports_state</code> was reported
as <code>closed</code>. This finding suggests that from the perspective
of this scan, the target host does not expose any network services that
are readily discoverable. Given that <code>192.168.1.100</code> is a
private IP address, this scan likely represents an internal network
perspective or a targeted probe. No specific service versions or
associated vulnerabilities were identified from this limited scan
data.</p></li>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and enhance Nova Terra’s overall
cybersecurity posture, the following actionable recommendations are
provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
Email Access:</strong> Deploy and rigorously enforce MFA for all
employee email accounts. This critical measure significantly reduces the
risk of unauthorized access even if primary credentials are compromised
through phishing or other means.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
Computer Logins:</strong> Deploy and enforce MFA for all employee
computer logins, especially for devices accessing sensitive internal
resources. This adds a crucial layer of security to endpoints and
prevents unauthorized access via stolen or guessed passwords.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement a Comprehensive Employee Acceptable
Use Policy (AUP):</strong> Draft a clear and comprehensive AUP outlining
acceptable use of company assets, networks, and data. Ensure all
employees formally review, understand, and acknowledge this policy as a
condition of employment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Mandatory Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong> Integrate comprehensive security awareness training
into the onboarding process for all new hires. This training should
cover common threats like phishing, social engineering, password best
practices, and secure data handling procedures.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Regular Internal Network Scans and Penetration
Testing:</strong> While the provided scan showed no open ports, this was
a limited view of a single internal IP. Conduct regular internal network
vulnerability scans and targeted penetration tests across the entire
internal infrastructure to identify potential weaknesses in systems,
applications, and configurations that may not be externally
exposed.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Nova Terra demonstrates some positive security practices, such as
annual security awareness training and the use of MFA for sensitive data
systems. However, the identified critical gaps in MFA implementation for
email and general computer access, coupled with the absence of
fundamental policies (AUP) and new hire security training, expose the
organization to significant and largely preventable risks. Proactively
addressing these weaknesses is paramount to strengthening Nova Terra’s
defense against the evolving landscape of cyber threats and fostering a
more robust security culture.</p>
