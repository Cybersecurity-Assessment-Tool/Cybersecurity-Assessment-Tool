<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">1. Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment for Solid State, conducted on 2026-01-27. The assessment
reviewed key organizational security controls via a questionnaire.
Critical data for a comprehensive technical assessment, specifically
network scan results (Input 1) and pre-existing vulnerability data
(Input 3), were unavailable or broken at the time of this report
generation, limiting the scope of technical analysis.</p>
<p>Based on the available information, Solid State exhibits significant
security gaps, particularly concerning the implementation of
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, and the
absence of annual security awareness training for all employees. These
gaps present high risks to the organization’s overall security posture.
Immediate action is required to address these deficiencies and to obtain
a complete technical assessment of the external attack surface.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">4. Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="network-scan-analysis">4.1 Network Scan
Analysis</h2>
<p>The provided network scan data (Input 1) was incomplete or broken,
therefore no analysis of open ports, services, versions, or potential
vulnerabilities from the external network perspective could be
performed. This represents a critical information gap, as the
organization’s external attack surface and associated technical risks
remain unassessed.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="existing-vulnerabilities-review">4.2 Existing
Vulnerabilities Review</h2>
<p>The input for existing vulnerabilities (Input 3) was also incomplete
or broken. Consequently, no pre-existing vulnerabilities or their
associated risks could be incorporated into this assessment. This
further limits the holistic understanding of the organization’s current
risk posture.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment">5. Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the available information, several high-priority risks and
critical gaps have been identified. The absence of comprehensive
technical scan data and pre-existing vulnerability information means
this assessment is primarily based on self-reported security controls,
and the actual technical risk landscape may be more severe.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="identified-gaps-and-associated-risks">5.1
Identified Gaps and Associated Risks</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Email Access:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Risk:</strong> High. Compromised email accounts (e.g.,
via phishing) can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data
exfiltration, account takeovers, and lateral movement within the
network. Without MFA, a simple password compromise grants full
access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Severity:</strong> Critical</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Risk:</strong> High. Similar to email, compromised user
credentials without MFA can grant attackers access to internal systems,
potentially leading to ransomware, data breaches, and disruption of
operations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Severity:</strong> Critical</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of Annual Security Awareness Training for All
Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Risk:</strong> High. Employees are often the weakest link
in the security chain. Without regular, up-to-date training, employees
are more susceptible to social engineering attacks (phishing, vishing,
smishing), inadvertently clicking malicious links, or falling for scams
that bypass technical controls.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Unassessed External Attack Surface:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Risk:</strong> High. Due to the lack of network scan
data, unknown open ports, outdated services, or misconfigurations on the
perimeter (including <code>175.36.146.2</code>) could expose critical
vulnerabilities to external attackers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Severity:</strong> Critical (based on potential unknown
threats)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Unknown Internal Vulnerabilities and Current Risk
Landscape:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Risk:</strong> High. Without an existing vulnerability
register or internal scan data, the organization is unaware of its
internal security weaknesses, making it difficult to prioritize
remediation efforts and potentially leaving critical systems
exposed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High (based on potential unknown
threats)</p></li>
</ul></li>

social engineering and common cyber threats, reinforcing a culture of
security.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="urgent-data-acquisition-critical-for-future-assessments">6.2 Urgent
Data Acquisition (Critical for Future Assessments)</h2>
<ol start="3">
<li><p><strong>Perform Comprehensive External Network Vulnerability
Scan:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Engage a cybersecurity firm to conduct
an in-depth vulnerability scan of all external-facing assets, including
the external IP address <code>175.36.146.2</code> and any public-facing
domains.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Identifies exploitable weaknesses on
the organization’s perimeter, allowing for proactive
remediation.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish a Vulnerability Management
Program:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Implement processes for regular
vulnerability scanning (internal and external), penetration testing, and
maintenance of a central vulnerability register to track, prioritize,
and remediate discovered issues.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Provides continuous visibility into the
organization’s evolving risk landscape and ensures timely patching and
configuration management.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="ongoing-security-enhancements">6.3 Ongoing
Security Enhancements</h2>
<ol start="5">
<li><p><strong>Review and Update Security Policies:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Regularly review and update existing
security policies, including the acceptable use policy, to reflect
current threats and best practices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Ensures that organizational guidelines
remain relevant and effective.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Consider Endpoint Detection and Response
(EDR):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Research and consider implementing an
EDR solution across all endpoints to provide advanced threat detection,
investigation, and response capabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Enhances visibility into endpoint
activity and provides rapid containment capabilities against
sophisticated attacks.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">7. Conclusion</h1>
<p>Solid State currently faces significant cybersecurity risks due to
critical gaps in security controls, particularly regarding Multi-Factor
Authentication and comprehensive security awareness training. The
inability to analyze technical scan results and existing vulnerabilities
presents a substantial blind spot. Addressing the identified MFA and
training deficiencies should be the immediate priority. Concurrently, a
full technical assessment is urgently needed to establish a baseline
understanding of the external attack surface and internal
vulnerabilities. Proactive measures, combined with a robust
vulnerability management program, are essential for improving Solid
State’s overall security posture.</p>
