<h1 class="unnumbered" id="introduction">1. Introduction</h1>
<p>This document presents a comprehensive cybersecurity posture
assessment for <strong>Nova Terra</strong>. The evaluation is based on
three primary data sources: organizational information, a security
controls questionnaire, and external network scan results, alongside any
reported pre-existing risks. The objective is to identify strengths,
weaknesses, and actionable recommendations to improve the organization’s
security landscape.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="organizational-information">1.1.
Organizational Information</h2>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-questionnaire-responses">2.1.
Analysis of Questionnaire Responses</h2>
<p>The review indicates a strong adoption of Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) across critical access points, which is a significant security
strength. However, two critical gaps were identified:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong>
The absence of an AUP leaves the organization vulnerable to misuse of IT
resources, potential data breaches due to unclear guidelines, and
compliance risks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training:</strong>
While new employees receive initial training, the lack of annual
refresher training for all employees means the workforce may not be
consistently updated on evolving cyber threats, making them susceptible
to social engineering, phishing, and other human-factor
exploits.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">3. Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was provided, targeting <code>[Target IP]</code>.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="external-network-scan">3.1. External Network
Scan</h2>
<p>The provided network scan data for target <code>[Target IP]</code>
indicated that the ‘scans‘ array was empty. This implies that no open
ports, services, or associated vulnerabilities were identified during
the scope of this particular scan.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Targeted IP/Domain:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> No scan date available due to empty
scan data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Findings:</strong> No open ports or active services were
detected.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implication:</strong> While an empty scan could indicate
a well-secured perimeter, it could also mean the scan was not fully
executed, or the provided data was incomplete. Without additional,
authenticated scanning data, a definitive assessment of the external
attack surface cannot be made.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment">4. Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the organizational data and security
controls questionnaire, the following risks have been identified. No
pre-existing vulnerabilities were provided in the input data
(‘Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON‘).</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">5. Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified gaps and enhance <strong>Nova
Terra</strong>’s cybersecurity posture, the following recommendations
are provided:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create a clear, comprehensive AUP that outlines proper usage of
company IT resources, data handling, and internet/email
policies.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all employees read, understand, and formally acknowledge
the AUP, preferably annually.</p></li>
<li><p>Integrate AUP review into employee onboarding and annual
compliance processes.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish a Mandatory Annual Security Awareness Training
Program:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement a mandatory, ongoing security awareness training
program for <em>all</em> employees, conducted at least once per
year.</p></li>
<li><p>Training should cover current threat landscapes, best practices
for identifying phishing and social engineering attempts, strong
password hygiene, secure data handling, and clear incident reporting
procedures.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider simulated phishing campaigns to test employee vigilance
and reinforce training concepts.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Regular and Comprehensive Vulnerability
Assessments:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Although the provided scan data was empty, it is critical to
perform regular, authenticated internal and external vulnerability
scans.</p></li>
<li><p>These scans should identify potential security weaknesses across
the entire IT infrastructure, including network devices, servers,
workstations, and web applications.</p></li>
<li><p>Prioritize and remediate identified vulnerabilities based on
severity and potential impact.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement a Policy Review and Update Cycle:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Establish a regular (e.g., annual) review cycle for all security
policies and procedures, including those related to MFA, AUP, and
training.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure policies remain current and effective against emerging
threats and comply with relevant regulations.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">6. Conclusion</h1>
<p><strong>Nova Terra</strong> demonstrates a commendable commitment to
cybersecurity by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication for critical
access points. However, the absence of an organization-wide Acceptable
Use Policy and annual security awareness training for all employees
presents significant human-factor risks that could be exploited.
Addressing these gaps through the implementation of robust policies and
ongoing training will substantially strengthen the organization’s
defense against a wide range of cyber threats. While no external
vulnerabilities were found in the provided scan data, it is prudent to
establish a continuous vulnerability management program to ensure
ongoing security. Proactive measures in these areas will significantly
enhance <strong>Nova Terra</strong>’s overall security posture and
resilience.</p>
