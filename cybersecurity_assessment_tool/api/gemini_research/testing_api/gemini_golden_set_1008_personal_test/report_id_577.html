<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of Fable &amp; Lore,
based on a combination of organizational self-reported data, network
scan results, and an assessment of existing risks. The analysis reveals
several critical security gaps and high-risk areas, notably the
widespread absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across multiple
critical access points (email, computer login, sensitive data systems),
the lack of an Employee Acceptable Use Policy, and the use of an
End-of-Life (EOL) Nginx web server. While some security awareness
training is conducted for new employees, annual training for all
employees is unfortunately missing. These findings indicate a
significant attack surface that requires immediate attention and
remediation to enhance the organization’s overall security resilience
and reduce exposure to common threat vectors.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on on 2025-11-22T10:00:00Z. The scan
identified the following host and its open services:</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="host">Host: </h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Status:</strong> Up</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports &amp; Services:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port:</strong> 443/TCP</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Service:</strong> HTTPS</p></li>

<li><p><strong>SSL Certificate Common Name:</strong></p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of
Technical Findings</h2>
<p>The Nginx web server running on port 443 with version 1.18.0 is a
critical concern. Nginx version 1.18.0 reached its End-of-Life (EOL) in
April 2021. Operating EOL software means it no longer receives crucial
security updates, leaving it highly vulnerable to newly discovered
exploits and known security flaws. This significantly elevates the risk
of compromise, potentially affecting the confidentiality, integrity, and
availability of any web services or data hosted on this server.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the organizational self-assessment and technical scan
results, the following risks have been identified. It is important to
note that Input 3 indicated no pre-existing vulnerabilities were
formally recorded by the organization.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and improve the overall
cybersecurity posture, the following actionable recommendations are
provided. These are categorized by urgency and impact.</p>
<h2 id="immediate-actions-critical-risks">Immediate Actions (Critical
Risks)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Access (R1):</strong> Immediately
deploy and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication for all email accounts
across the organization. This should be a top priority due to the high
impact of email compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Login (R2):</strong> Require
MFA for all user logins to company computers and endpoints. Integrate
MFA with directory services (e.g., Active Directory) where
applicable.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems (R3):</strong>
Enforce MFA for access to all systems and applications containing
sensitive or critical organizational data. Conduct an inventory of such
systems to ensure comprehensive coverage.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade/Patch EOL Nginx Server (R6):</strong> Promptly
upgrade the Nginx web server from version 1.18.0 to the latest stable,
supported version (e.g., Nginx 1.24.x or newer mainline releases).
Alternatively, if the application is not actively maintained, plan for
migration to a currently supported web server solution. Prioritize
patching or migrating any web applications hosted on this server to
mitigate known vulnerabilities.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mid-term-actions-high-risks">Mid-Term Actions (High Risks)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(R4):</strong> Create, formally approve, disseminate, and enforce a
clear Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). This policy should outline expected
employee behavior regarding company IT resources, data handling,
internet usage, and security best practices. Ensure all employees
acknowledge and understand the policy, ideally through a mandatory
annual review process.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Annual Security Awareness Training
(R5):</strong> Implement a comprehensive and mandatory annual security
awareness training program for all employees. This training should go
beyond basic concepts and cover current threats (e.g., advanced phishing
techniques, social engineering tactics), company-specific policies,
incident reporting procedures, and best practices for data protection
and secure remote work.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Fable &amp; Lore faces significant cybersecurity challenges due to
several critical security control gaps and the use of outdated software.
Addressing the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication across key access
points and updating the End-of-Life Nginx server are paramount for
immediate risk reduction and enhancing the baseline security posture.
Furthermore, the establishment of foundational policies such as an
Acceptable Use Policy and the implementation of ongoing, annual employee
security awareness training will build a more resilient and
human-centric security defense. Proactive and timely implementation of
these recommendations will substantially reduce the organization’s
exposure to common attack vectors and significantly improve its ability
to protect valuable assets and maintain operational continuity.</p>
