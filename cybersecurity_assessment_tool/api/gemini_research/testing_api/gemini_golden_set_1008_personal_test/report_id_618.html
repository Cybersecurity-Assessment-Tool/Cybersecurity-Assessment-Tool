<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This cybersecurity posture assessment for <strong>Blackwood
Industries</strong> reveals a mixed security landscape. Positive aspects
include the implementation of MFA for email and sensitive data systems,
along with an acceptable use policy and annual security training.
However, two critical gaps were identified: the lack of multi-factor
authentication (MFA) for computer logins and the absence of security
awareness training for new employees.</p>
<p>The provided network scan data for target <code>192.168.0.5</code>
was highly limited, indicating no open ports with detailed service
information. This directly contradicts an existing risk entry regarding
an "Unencrypted Web Server" on Port 80, which the scan shows as closed.
This discrepancy requires immediate clarification. The organization
should prioritize addressing the identified questionnaire-based security
control gaps and conduct more comprehensive technical assessments.</p>

<h4 id="analysis-of-control-gaps">Analysis of Control Gaps:</h4>
<p>The questionnaire identified two significant control gaps:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Q2 - MFA for Computer Logins:</strong> The absence of MFA
for computer logins represents a critical vulnerability. Credential
compromise could lead to full system access without an additional
authentication factor, making it easier for attackers to gain
persistence and escalate privileges.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Q5 - Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong> Failing to conduct security awareness training for
new employees leaves them highly susceptible to common social
engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) and unaware of crucial
organizational security policies from the outset. This creates a weak
initial security posture for new hires.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed using Nmap, targeting the specified IP
address. The results are summarized below.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target Scanned:</strong>
<code>192.168.0.5</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not specified in the provided scan
metadata.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="host-status">Host Status:</h4>
<p>The target host <code>192.168.0.5</code> was reported as
<code>up</code>.</p>
<h4 id="port-scan-findings">Port Scan Findings:</h4>
<p>The scan identified the following port statuses on
<code>192.168.0.5</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 80 (HTTP):</strong> State:
<code>closed</code></p></li>
</ul>
<p>No other open ports or detailed service names, products, or version
information were provided in the scan results. The limited nature of
this scan means a comprehensive technical assessment of running services
and potential software vulnerabilities cannot be derived solely from
this data.</p>
<h4 id="contradiction-with-existing-risks">Contradiction with Existing
Risks:</h4>
<p>It is important to note a direct contradiction between these scan
results and an existing risk entry (see Section <a
href="#sec:risk_assessment" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:risk_assessment">5</a>). An existing risk,
"Unencrypted Web Server," explicitly states "Port 80 is open." However,
the most recent scan on <code>192.168.0.5</code> clearly shows Port 80
as <code>closed</code>. This discrepancy requires immediate
clarification to determine if the risk is truly mitigated, if it
pertains to a different asset not covered by this scan, or if the scan
was incomplete.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the comprehensive analysis of organizational data, security
control review, and technical scan results, the following
recommendations are provided to enhance the cybersecurity posture of
Blackwood Industries:</p>
<h2 id="immediate-actions-high-priority">Immediate Actions (High
Priority)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Logins:</strong> Immediately
develop and implement a strategy to enforce multi-factor authentication
for all computer logins across the organization. This is a critical
control to significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access stemming
from compromised credentials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mandatory New Employee Security Training:</strong>
Establish a mandatory and comprehensive security awareness training
program for all new employees as an integral part of their onboarding
process. This training should cover essential topics such as phishing
detection, malware prevention, strong password practices, and adherence
to organizational security policies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Clarify "Unencrypted Web Server" Risk:</strong> Conduct
an urgent investigation into the discrepancy between the existing
"Unencrypted Web Server" risk and the recent scan results which show
Port 80 as closed. Determine if the risk is truly mitigated, if it
applies to a different server/IP address, or if the original risk
assessment was outdated or inaccurate for the scanned target. If the
risk is still valid for other assets, ensure appropriate SSL/TLS
implementation is enforced.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="further-assessment-long-term-initiatives">Further Assessment
&amp; Long-Term Initiatives</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Comprehensive Network Scan:</strong> Conduct a more
comprehensive network scan of all internal and external assets to
identify all open ports, running services, and their precise versions.
This will provide a more complete and accurate picture of the
organization’s attack surface and help identify uncatalogued services or
outdated software.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Vulnerability Management Program:</strong> Establish and
implement a robust vulnerability management program that includes
regular vulnerability scans, periodic penetration testing, and a
structured process for identifying, assessing, prioritizing, and
remediating identified vulnerabilities systematically.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Security Awareness Training Review:</strong>
While annual training exists, regularly review and update the content of
security awareness training for all employees to address evolving threat
landscapes, new attack vectors, and ensure maximum effectiveness and
relevance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Incident Response Plan Review:</strong> Ensure an
up-to-date and well-tested incident response plan is in place and
employees are aware of their roles and responsibilities during a
security incident.</p></li>
