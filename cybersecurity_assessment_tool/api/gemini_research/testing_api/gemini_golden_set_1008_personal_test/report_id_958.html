<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture assessment for
Blackwood Industries, conducted through a review of organizational
security controls and an external network scan. The assessment
identified several commendable security practices, particularly the
implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and
sensitive data systems, and the presence of an acceptable use policy.
However, critical gaps were identified regarding the absence of MFA for
computer logins and a lack of consistent security awareness training for
both new and existing employees. The external network scan did not
identify any open ports or services exposed for the target scanned,
suggesting a relatively locked-down external perimeter or that the scan
did not yield active responses. Addressing the identified high-severity
risks related to authentication and human-element training is paramount
to enhancing the overall security resilience of the organization.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed against the target IP address
. The scan was conducted on 2026-01-27.</p>
<h2 id="summary-of-findings">Summary of Findings</h2>
<p>No open ports or services were identified during the external network
scan of . This indicates that the target, as scanned, either has a
tightly controlled perimeter with no exposed services or the scan did
not yield any active responses.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the security control review, several high-severity risks
were identified. No pre-existing vulnerabilities were provided, and the
technical scan yielded no findings. The primary risks, therefore, stem
from gaps in fundamental organizational security practices.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and enhance Blackwood Industries’
cybersecurity posture, the following recommendations are provided:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Logins (Addressing
R-01):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Deploy and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all
employee computer logins, especially for devices accessing sensitive
data or network resources. This adds a crucial layer of security beyond
just passwords.</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluate suitable MFA solutions compatible with the
organization’s existing IT infrastructure.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Mandatory New Employee Security Awareness
Training (Addressing R-02):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and implement a mandatory security awareness training
program for all new hires as part of their onboarding process.</p></li>
<li><p>The training should cover essential topics such as phishing,
password best practices, incident reporting procedures, and the
acceptable use policy.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Regular All-Employee Security Awareness Training
(Addressing R-03):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement a recurring (at least annual) security awareness
training program for all employees.</p></li>
<li><p>Training should be engaging, updated with current threat
landscapes, and include simulated phishing exercises to test employee
vigilance.</p></li>
<li><p>Track completion rates and provide refresher training as
needed.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Continuous Monitoring (General
Recommendation):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement continuous monitoring of external-facing assets to
detect any unauthorized services or changes.</p></li>
<li><p>Regularly review and update security policies and controls to
adapt to evolving threats.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Blackwood Industries demonstrates a foundational understanding of
cybersecurity by implementing MFA for critical systems and maintaining
an acceptable use policy. However, the lack of MFA for computer access
and the absence of comprehensive and recurring security awareness
training represent significant vulnerabilities that could be exploited.
By promptly addressing these high-priority recommendations, Blackwood
Industries can significantly bolster its defenses against common cyber
threats and foster a stronger security-aware culture.</p>
