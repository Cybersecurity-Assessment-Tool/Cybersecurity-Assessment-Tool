<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of <strong>Grizzly
Peak</strong>, based on an analysis of provided organizational data, a
targeted network scan, and existing risk information. The assessment
reveals several critical security gaps and a highly concerning
discrepancy between the organization’s documented security status and
live scan results.</p>
<p>Key findings include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Critical Discrepancy Identified:</strong> An internal
network scan found Port 8080 open on <code>10.5.5.5</code>, explicitly
identifying a system with the title “TOP SECRET DB”. This directly
contradicts the existing risk register, which inaccurately labels this
port as “secured and false positive” with a severity of 0.0. This
represents an extremely high-risk exposure of potentially sensitive
data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pervasive Control Gaps:</strong> The organization
currently lacks fundamental security controls and policies, including
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer login, and
sensitive data access. Furthermore, there is no Employee Acceptable Use
Policy (AUP) and no security awareness training program for new or
existing employees.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Overall Posture:</strong> The current security posture of
<strong>Grizzly Peak</strong> is assessed as <strong>High Risk</strong>.
This is primarily driven by the exposed sensitive system, the complete
absence of MFA across critical access points, and significant
deficiencies in security governance and employee training. Urgent and
comprehensive remediation efforts are required.</p></li>

</div>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-questionnaire-findings">Analysis
of Questionnaire Findings</h2>
<p>The questionnaire results indicate a universal absence of crucial
security controls and policies. All six questions, covering critical
areas such as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP), and Security Awareness Training (SAT), received a "No" response.
These represent fundamental vulnerabilities that significantly elevate
the organization’s risk profile.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>No MFA Usage:</strong> The complete lack of MFA across
email, computer login, and sensitive data systems means that compromised
credentials alone can grant unauthorized access to critical
organizational assets. This is a severe security flaw.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Policies and Training:</strong> The absence of an
AUP and security awareness training (both for new and existing
employees) suggests a lack of foundational cybersecurity governance.
This significantly increases the risk of human error, insider threats,
and successful social engineering attacks.</p></li>

<h3 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of
Technical Findings</h3>
<p>The presence of an open port 8080 with the HTTP title “TOP SECRET DB”
is a critical finding. This strongly suggests that a system potentially
containing highly sensitive or confidential information is exposed via a
web interface. While the target is an internal IP address
(<code>10.5.5.5</code>), an internal breach, malicious insider, or
lateral movement from another compromised system could easily lead to
unauthorized access to this critical system. The explicit banner “TOP
SECRET DB” itself is a major security concern, indicating a system that
should be exceptionally well-protected.</p>

<p>This section consolidates risks identified from the organizational
questionnaire, technical scan, and previously acknowledged
vulnerabilities. A severe discrepancy regarding Port 8080 has been

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the assessment findings, the following recommendations are
provided to significantly improve <strong>Grizzly Peak</strong>’s
cybersecurity posture. They are prioritized based on severity and
immediate impact.</p>
<h2 id="immediate-actions-critical-risks">Immediate Actions (Critical
Risks)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Investigate and Secure “TOP SECRET DB” on Port
8080:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Urgent Action:</strong> Immediately investigate the
system residing on <code>10.5.5.5</code>:8080. Determine its exact
purpose, the sensitivity of the data it hosts, and whether its network
exposure is intentional, accidental, or unauthorized.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Access Control:</strong> If the system must remain
accessible, implement robust access controls, including strong
authentication (MFA where technically feasible), strict IP restrictions
(e.g., firewall rules allowing access only from specific management
hosts), and encryption for data in transit and at rest.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Security Hardening:</strong> Apply all necessary security
patches, reconfigure the service to prevent information leakage (e.g.,
suppress the “TOP SECRET DB” banner), and remove any sensitive data if
not strictly required for its operational function.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Decommission/Isolate:</strong> If the system is obsolete,
unauthorized, or contains data that cannot be securely exposed,
decommission it immediately or isolate it from the network.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Review and Update Risk Register Promptly:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Conduct an urgent review of the organization’s risk register,
specifically correcting the inaccurate “Port 8080 Secured” entry and
updating it to reflect the critical exposure of the “TOP SECRET
DB”.</p></li>
<li><p>Establish a robust process for regular and thorough validation of
identified risks, especially those marked as “false positives”, to
prevent future discrepancies.</p></li>

workstation access) to enhance endpoint security.</p></li>
<li><p>Extend MFA to all sensitive data systems and applications to
safeguard critical information assets.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Draft a comprehensive AUP outlining clear guidelines on
acceptable use of company IT resources, data handling, internet usage,
and security responsibilities.</p></li>
<li><p>Distribute the AUP to all employees and obtain signed
acknowledgments to ensure understanding and compliance.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish a Robust Security Awareness Training
Program:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement mandatory security awareness training for all new
employees as part of their onboarding process.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct annual mandatory security awareness training for all
existing employees, covering current threats like phishing, social
engineering, data protection, and incident reporting.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider incorporating periodic phishing simulations to test
employee vigilance and reinforce training concepts.</p></li>
