<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for , integrating findings from a network scan, self-reported
organizational security controls, and existing risk documentation. The
analysis reveals several critical areas requiring immediate attention,
primarily concerning foundational security practices such as
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), employee policies, and security
awareness training. While the network scan of did not identify any
immediately exploitable open ports, the identified organizational gaps
represent significant vulnerabilities. Furthermore, a pre-existing risk
related to unencrypted web services, though currently not confirmed by
the live scan on the target, warrants further investigation. Addressing
these findings is crucial for enhancing ’s overall security
resilience.</p>

Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was conducted on the internal target .</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="summary-of-findings">Summary of
Findings:</h2>
<p>The scan identified the target host as being <code>up</code>.
Critically, no open ports with identified services were found.
Specifically, port 80 was reported as <strong>closed</strong>. This
finding suggests that typical web services (HTTP) are not directly
exposed on this particular host. No further details on services,
products, or versions could be gathered due to the absence of open
ports.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and enhance the overall
cybersecurity posture of , the following actionable recommendations are
provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Logins:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Deploy and enforce Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for all user logins to company computers,
workstations, and servers, especially for devices accessing sensitive
internal networks and data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Significantly reduces the risk of
unauthorized access resulting from compromised credentials, even if
passwords are stolen.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Create a comprehensive AUP that clearly
outlines employee responsibilities, defines acceptable and unacceptable
use of company IT resources (hardware, software, networks, internet),
and details the consequences of policy violations. Ensure all employees
read, understand, and formally acknowledge this policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Establishes clear behavioral
guidelines, reduces the likelihood of misuse of company resources, and
provides a framework for addressing security incidents and
non-compliance.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish a Robust Security Awareness Training
Program:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Implement a mandatory and ongoing
security awareness training program. This should include initial
training for all new employees during onboarding and annual refresher
training for all staff. Key topics should cover phishing and social
engineering, strong password practices, safe data handling, incident
reporting procedures, and the importance of adhering to company security
policies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Educates employees on prevalent cyber
threats, cultivates a strong security-conscious culture, and
significantly reduces the organization’s susceptibility to
human-error-related security incidents.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Verify and Address Unencrypted Web Services:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Investigate the discrepancy between the
pre-existing risk (unencrypted web server) and the current network scan
findings (port 80 closed on ). Determine if this risk applies to other
systems within the organization’s infrastructure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>If relevant to other systems:</strong> Identify any other
internal or external web servers operating without encryption (e.g.,
HTTP on port 80 or 8080 without a forced redirect to HTTPS). For any
such identified servers, implement HTTPS by acquiring and installing
valid SSL/TLS certificates.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Protects data in transit from
eavesdropping, tampering, and man-in-the-middle attacks, ensuring
confidentiality and integrity for web-based communications.</p></li>
</ul></li>
