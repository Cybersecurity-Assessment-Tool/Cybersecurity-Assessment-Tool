<p><span><strong>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</strong></span>
<span>For: <strong>Granite Shield</strong></span> <span><strong>Prepared
by:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Expert-level Cybersecurity Analyst</span>
<span>2026-01-26</span> <span>This report contains confidential
information and should be handled with care.</span></p>
</div>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of Granite Shield based
on a review of organizational data and security questionnaire responses.
Due to the absence of active network scan data, the assessment primarily
focuses on policy, process, and foundational control
implementations.</p>
<p>The assessment reveals several critical gaps in Granite Shield’s
security framework, notably the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) for computer logins and access to sensitive data systems.
Additionally, the organization lacks an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP) and does not conduct annual security awareness training for all
employees. While MFA is employed for email access and initial security
awareness training is provided to new employees, these critical
omissions expose the organization to significant risks, including
unauthorized access, data breaches, and non-compliance with industry
best practices.</p>
<p>Recommendations prioritize the immediate implementation of MFA across
all critical access points, the development of essential security
policies, and the establishment of a robust, recurring security
awareness training program. Adherence to these recommendations is
crucial for enhancing Granite Shield’s resilience against modern cyber
threats.</p>
<p>This section provides key identification and operational details for
Granite Shield.</p>

</div>
<p>Based on the findings, the following recommendations are provided to
enhance Granite Shield’s cybersecurity posture:</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="immediate-actions-critical">6.1. Immediate
Actions (Critical)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Login:</strong> Mandate
Multi-Factor Authentication for all user accounts logging into company
computers and internal networks. This is a fundamental control against
credential theft.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> Extend
MFA requirements to all systems storing or processing sensitive
organizational or client data. This significantly reduces the risk of
unauthorized access to critical information.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="high-priority-actions">6.2. High Priority
Actions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a formal AUP that clearly outlines the acceptable
and unacceptable use of company IT resources, data, and systems. Ensure
all employees read and acknowledge this policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mandate Annual Security Awareness Training for All
Employees:</strong> Implement a recurring, mandatory security awareness
training program for all employees at least once per year. This training
should cover current threats, organizational policies, and best
practices (e.g., phishing, social engineering, password
hygiene).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="general-security-enhancements">6.3. General
Security Enhancements</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Regular Network Scans and Vulnerability
Assessments:</strong> Perform periodic (e.g., quarterly) external and
internal network vulnerability scans and penetration tests. This
proactive measure will identify technical weaknesses, outdated software,
and misconfigurations that could be exploited by attackers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regularly Review and Update Security Policies:</strong>
Establish a schedule for reviewing and updating all security policies,
including the AUP, to ensure they remain relevant and effective against
the evolving threat landscape.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Granite Shield has initiated some fundamental security measures, such
as MFA for email and initial security awareness training. However, the
current assessment highlights significant gaps, particularly regarding
the comprehensive application of MFA, the formalization of user
policies, and ongoing security education. Addressing the identified
critical and high-priority risks will substantially improve the
organization’s defensive capabilities and reduce its overall cyber risk
exposure. A proactive and layered security approach, starting with the
implementation of these recommendations, is vital for safeguarding
Granite Shield’s assets and maintaining trust.</p>
