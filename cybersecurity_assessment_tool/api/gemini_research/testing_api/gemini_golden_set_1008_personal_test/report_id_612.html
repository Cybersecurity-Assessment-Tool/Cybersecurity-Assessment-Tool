<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details a cybersecurity posture assessment for
<strong>New Era</strong>, based on self-attested organizational data.
Due to significant data unavailability regarding network scan results
and existing risk registers, this assessment primarily focuses on
identified gaps in security controls as reported by the
organization.</p>
<p>Key findings include critical gaps in Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) implementation for computer logins and sensitive data systems,
alongside a lack of mandatory annual security awareness training for all
employees. These areas represent significant vulnerabilities that could
be exploited by adversaries, increasing the risk of unauthorized access
and data breaches.</p>
<p>A comprehensive technical vulnerability assessment could not be
performed due to the lack of network scan data. This limitation means
potential technical vulnerabilities, such as outdated software, exposed
services, or misconfigurations, remain unassessed. Similarly,
pre-existing organizational risks could not be incorporated.</p>
<p>Recommendations prioritize the immediate implementation of MFA across
critical access points, establishing regular security awareness
training, and conducting thorough technical vulnerability scans to gain
a complete understanding of the organization’s technical risk
landscape.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>Network scan data was either unavailable or could not be processed at
the time of this report. Therefore, no technical vulnerabilities derived
from active scanning are included in this assessment. This significantly
limits the scope of the technical risk assessment. It is strongly
recommended to perform a comprehensive network scan of
<code>[Target IP]</code> or the relevant internal and external
infrastructure to identify potential technical vulnerabilities such as
open ports, outdated services, or misconfigurations.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the available organizational information and self-attested
security control review, the following risks have been identified. Note
that this assessment is limited by the absence of network scan data and
pre-existing risk register information.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified gaps and strengthen the overall
cybersecurity posture of New Era, the following recommendations are
provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer
Logins:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Evaluate and deploy robust MFA solutions
(e.g., FIDO2, smart cards, authenticator apps) for all user log-ins to
organizational computers and workstations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Significantly reduces the risk of
unauthorized access to internal systems, even if passwords are stolen
through phishing or other credential compromise techniques.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive
Data Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Mandate MFA for all access to systems
containing sensitive organizational or client data, including databases,
file shares, and critical business applications.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Adds a critical layer of security to
protect high-value assets from unauthorized breaches, enhancing data
confidentiality and integrity.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Annual Security Awareness Training for All
Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Implement a mandatory, comprehensive
annual security awareness training program for all employees, covering
topics such as phishing, social engineering, password hygiene, data
handling, and organizational policies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Educates employees on evolving cyber
threats, best practices, and organizational policies, turning them into
a stronger line of defense against human-factor attacks.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct a Comprehensive Network Vulnerability
Scan:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediately perform regular,
authenticated and unauthenticated vulnerability scans of all internal
and external network assets (including <code>170.55.244.71</code> and
any other relevant infrastructure).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Identifies open ports, vulnerable
services, outdated software, misconfigurations, and other technical
weaknesses that could be exploited by attackers, providing crucial data
for proactive remediation.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Maintain an Organizational Risk
Register:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Establish and regularly review a formal
risk register to document, assess, and track all identified
cybersecurity risks, including those from technical scans, policy gaps,
and compliance requirements.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Provides a structured approach to risk
management, ensuring that risks are understood, prioritized, and
mitigated effectively, and offers a clear view of the organization’s
risk landscape.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Policy Review and Enforcement:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Periodically review and update all
security policies, including the acceptable use policy, to ensure they
remain relevant, reflect current threats, and are effectively
communicated and enforced across the organization.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Maintains a clear framework for secure
behavior and operational security, minimizing policy-related
vulnerabilities.</p></li>
