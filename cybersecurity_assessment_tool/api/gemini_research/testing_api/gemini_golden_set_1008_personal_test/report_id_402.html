<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">1. Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of Vertex Solutions,
based on an analysis of provided organizational data, network scan
findings, and pre-existing risk information.</p>
<p><strong>Key Strengths:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Strong implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across
email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems significantly
enhances identity and access management.</p></li>
<li><p>Security awareness training is conducted for new
employees.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Findings &amp; Gaps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Policy Gap:</strong> Absence of a formal employee
acceptable use policy (AUP), which is crucial for defining expected
behavior and protecting organizational assets.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Training Gap:</strong> Lack of annual security awareness
training for all employees, increasing susceptibility to evolving cyber
threats.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Technical Scan:</strong> No open ports were detected on
the scanned target, which is a positive security indicator.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Risk Discrepancy:</strong> A previously identified risk,
"Unencrypted Web Server" (severity: Medium), cited an open Port 80.
However, the current network scan shows Port 80 as
<strong>closed</strong>, suggesting this risk may be mitigated or
requires re-evaluation based on the latest findings.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong> Immediate actions should focus on
establishing an AUP, implementing annual security awareness training,
and validating the status of previously identified risks against current
technical findings.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">4. Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was conducted on the specified internal target to
identify open ports and services.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not specified in the provided scan
metadata.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Target:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Used:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> The host was detected as
<code>up</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Port Scan Findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 80:</strong> Detected as
<code>closed</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Summary:</strong> No open ports were identified during
this scan. This indicates a minimal immediate attack surface on the
scanned host from a network perspective.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note on Discrepancy:</strong> The finding that Port 80 is
<code>closed</code> directly contradicts a previously identified risk
("Unencrypted Web Server") that assumed Port 80 was open. This suggests
that the condition leading to that risk may have been mitigated or was
misidentified.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">6. Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the assessment, the following recommendations are provided
to enhance Vertex Solutions’ cybersecurity posture.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="policy-and-governance">6.1. Policy and
Governance</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong>
Develop, communicate, and enforce a clear AUP for all employees. This
policy should define appropriate use of company assets, data, and
internet access, outlining consequences for non-compliance. Regular
reviews and updates are essential.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mandate Annual Security Awareness Training:</strong>
Establish a program for mandatory annual security awareness training for
all employees. Training should cover current threats (e.g., phishing,
ransomware), password best practices, data handling, and the importance
of the AUP.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="technical-controls">6.2. Technical
Controls</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Verify Previously Identified Risks:</strong> Conduct a
thorough review of the "Unencrypted Web Server" risk. Given the recent
scan shows Port 80 is closed, investigate whether this port was
intentionally closed as a mitigation measure. If the service is no
longer needed or has been moved, formally close the risk. If the service
is still required, ensure it is properly secured (e.g., using HTTPS on
Port 443 instead of HTTP on Port 80).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Vulnerability Scanning:</strong> Continue with
regular network and vulnerability scanning across all external and
internal assets to proactively identify and address potential
weaknesses.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="general-security-practices">6.3. General
Security Practices</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Maintain Strong MFA Implementation:</strong> Continue the
current practice of requiring MFA for email, computer logins, and
sensitive data systems. Explore expanding MFA to other critical
applications or services where applicable.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Documentation and Review:</strong> Ensure all security
policies, procedures, and risk assessments are thoroughly documented and
reviewed regularly (at least annually) to adapt to evolving threats and
organizational changes.</p></li>
