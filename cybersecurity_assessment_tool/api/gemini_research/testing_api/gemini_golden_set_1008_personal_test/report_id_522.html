<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive assessment of the cybersecurity
posture for <strong>Velocity Ventures</strong> based on provided network
scan data, organizational security questionnaire responses, and
documented existing risks.</p>
<p>The assessment identified critical gaps in Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) implementation and regular security awareness
training. Specifically, MFA is not required for computer logins or
access to sensitive data systems, and annual security awareness training
for all employees is not consistently conducted. While the current
network scan of <code>192.168.0.5</code> did not identify any open
ports, indicating a good perimeter posture for the scanned target, a
previously documented risk concerning an unencrypted web server (Port 80
being open) was noted. This historical risk should be investigated, even
though the current scan shows the port as closed, to understand its
origin and ensure long-term mitigation.</p>
<p>Addressing these findings through strategic recommendations,
including the broad implementation of MFA and a robust, recurring
security awareness program, will significantly enhance the
organization’s resilience against modern cyber threats.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>This section details the findings from the network scan performed
using Nmap.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scanner:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Target:</strong> <code>192.168.0.5</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> N/A (Date not provided in scan
metadata)</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="open-ports-and-services">Open Ports and
Services</h2>
<p>The network scan identified that the target host
<code>192.168.0.5</code> is up, but no open ports were detected.
Specifically, port 80 was found to be in a <code>closed</code>
state.</p>
<p>This indicates a strong posture for the scanned host concerning
network-based services, as there are no immediately accessible services
that could be exploited externally via open network ports.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered"
id="identified-risks-and-vulnerabilities">Identified Risks and
Vulnerabilities</h1>
<p>This section consolidates risks identified from security control
gaps, technical scan findings, and pre-existing documented
vulnerabilities.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="security-control-gaps">Security Control
Gaps</h2>
<p>The following critical security control gaps were identified from the
organizational questionnaire responses:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Computer Login:</strong> Not requiring
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins significantly
increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are
compromised. This is a high risk for internal system integrity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> Failure
to implement MFA for sensitive data systems poses a severe risk, as it
allows attackers with stolen credentials to potentially access critical
information. This is a critical risk for data confidentiality.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Infrequent Security Awareness Training:</strong> Not
conducting annual security awareness training for all employees leaves
the organization vulnerable to phishing, social engineering, and other
human-centric attacks, as employees may not be updated on the latest
threats and best practices. This is a high risk for human factor
vulnerabilities.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="technical-vulnerabilities-from-current-scan">Technical
Vulnerabilities (from Current Scan)</h2>
<p>The current network scan of <code>192.168.0.5</code> did not identify
any open ports or services that present immediate technical
vulnerabilities. This indicates that the scanned host is well-hardened
against network-based attacks on common ports.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="pre-existingknown-risks">Pre-existing/Known
Risks</h2>
<p>The following risk has been previously documented for the
organization:</p>

<br />
<strong>Note on Discrepancy:</strong> The pre-existing risk indicates
"Port 80 is open." However, the current network scan (Input 1) for
target <code>192.168.0.5</code> explicitly found Port 80 to be
<code>closed</code>. This discrepancy suggests that the pre-existing
risk may either be outdated, refer to a different system/target, or that
mitigation actions have been successfully implemented on the scanned
host. It is recommended to clarify the origin of this historical risk
and confirm its current applicability across all relevant assets.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the findings, the following recommendations are provided to
enhance the organization’s cybersecurity posture:</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="immediate-actions">Immediate Actions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Logins:</strong> Immediately
enforce Multi-Factor Authentication for all employee computer logins.
This adds a critical layer of security against credential theft.
Prioritize administrative accounts and sensitive endpoints.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> Extend
MFA requirements to all systems handling sensitive organizational data.
Prioritize systems with the highest impact in case of
compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Annual Security Awareness Training:</strong>
Develop and implement a mandatory annual security awareness training
program for all employees. This should cover current threat landscapes,
phishing, social engineering, and data handling best practices.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="mid-term-actions">Mid-Term Actions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Review and Reconcile Historical Risks:</strong>
Investigate the discrepancy regarding the "Unencrypted Web Server" risk
(Port 80 open). Determine if this risk applies to other systems, is
outdated, or if the current closed status for <code>192.168.0.5</code>
is a recent successful mitigation. Update risk registers accordingly,
and ensure any web services are protected with encryption (e.g.,
HTTPS).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Network Scanning:</strong> Establish a schedule
for regular internal and external network vulnerability scans to
proactively identify and address potential weaknesses before they can be
exploited.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="long-term-strategic-initiatives">Long-Term
Strategic Initiatives</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Comprehensive Risk Management Framework:</strong>
Implement a robust risk management framework to systematically identify,
assess, mitigate, and monitor cybersecurity risks across the
organization.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Incident Response Plan Development/Review:</strong>
Ensure a well-defined and regularly tested incident response plan is in
place to effectively handle and recover from security
incidents.</p></li>
