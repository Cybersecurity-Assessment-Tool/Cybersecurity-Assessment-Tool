<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This document presents a comprehensive cybersecurity posture
assessment for <strong>Iron River Finance</strong>. The assessment aims
to identify strengths, weaknesses, and potential risks by analyzing
provided organizational data, a security control questionnaire, and
technical network scan information. The findings are intended to guide
strategic improvements in the organization’s cybersecurity defenses.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following information was provided for the organization under
assessment:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Organization Name:</strong> Iron River Finance</p></li>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A security questionnaire was completed to assess the implementation
of key cybersecurity controls and policies. The results highlight
several critical gaps in the organization’s security posture.</p>

</div>
<h2 id="analysis-of-security-control-gaps">Analysis of Security Control
Gaps</h2>
<p>The questionnaire results indicate a complete absence of several
foundational cybersecurity controls. Specifically, the lack of
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all assessed areas (email,
computer login, sensitive data systems) significantly increases the risk
of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials. Furthermore, the
absence of an acceptable use policy and regular security awareness
training suggests a potential lack of employee understanding regarding
cybersecurity best practices, creating a vulnerable human element within
the organization. These are critical deficiencies that require immediate
attention as they form the bedrock of a robust security posture.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was intended to identify open ports, running services,
and potential vulnerabilities on external systems.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> No scan data provided.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of Technical
Findings</h2>
<p>No network scan data was provided, and the target IP was not
specified in the input. Consequently, no technical analysis regarding
open ports, service versions, or network-based vulnerabilities could be
performed. A comprehensive network scan is highly recommended to
establish an accurate baseline of the external attack surface and
identify potential entry points for attackers.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the provided information, a preliminary risk assessment has
been conducted. The most significant risks stem directly from the
identified gaps in security controls outlined in Section <a
href="#tab:security_controls" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="tab:security_controls">1</a>.</p>

<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of MFA for Email</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Without MFA, compromised email credentials
(e.g., via phishing) can lead to full account takeover, data breaches,
and business email compromise, with potentially severe financial and
reputational damage.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">High</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of MFA for Computer Login</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Without MFA, compromised login credentials
can grant attackers easy access to internal systems, facilitating
lateral movement, data exfiltration, and system compromise.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">High</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data
Systems</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Absence of MFA on sensitive data systems
makes these systems highly vulnerable to unauthorized access if primary
credentials are breached, risking severe data loss or compliance
violations.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">High</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">No Employee Acceptable Use Policy</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Without a formal AUP, employees may engage
in unsafe online behaviors, download malware, or misuse company
resources, significantly increasing security risks from internal
factors.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">High</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">No New Employee Security Training</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">New employees are a significant
vulnerability if not immediately educated on security best practices,
leading to potential accidental breaches, phishing susceptibility, and
policy non-compliance.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">High</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">No Annual Security Training</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Without regular security awareness
training, employees may forget best practices, fall victim to evolving
threats (e.g., new phishing tactics), or fail to report suspicious
activities, maintaining a high human-factor risk.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">High</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Undefined Network Attack Surface</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The absence of network scan data means the
organization’s external attack surface is unknown. This prevents
proactive identification and mitigation of perimeter vulnerabilities,
leaving potential critical weaknesses exposed.</td>

<h2 id="existing-vulnerabilities-review">Existing Vulnerabilities
Review</h2>
<p>No existing vulnerabilities were provided in the input data
(‘Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON‘). Therefore, this report does not cover
previously identified and tracked vulnerabilities within the

</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The current cybersecurity posture of <strong>Iron River
Finance</strong> indicates significant and critical weaknesses due to
the complete absence of fundamental security controls and policies. The
lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), a formal Acceptable Use
Policy (AUP), and comprehensive security awareness training exposes the
organization to a very high risk of credential compromise, unauthorized
access, and human-factor related breaches. While no technical scan data
or existing vulnerabilities were provided for analysis, the identified
control gaps alone necessitate immediate and decisive action. Adopting
the recommended measures will significantly enhance the organization’s
resilience against common cyber threats, establish a stronger security
foundation, and demonstrate a commitment to protecting its assets and
data.</p>
