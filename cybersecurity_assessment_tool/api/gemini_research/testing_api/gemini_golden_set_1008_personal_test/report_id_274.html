<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was requested for target <code>[Target IP]</code>.
However, no detailed network scan results (e.g., open ports, services,
versions, scan date) were provided for analysis in the input data.
Therefore, no technical vulnerabilities stemming from a network
perspective could be identified or reported at this time.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the provided organizational data and questionnaire
responses, the following risks have been identified. It is important to
note that without detailed technical scan data and pre-existing
vulnerability information, this assessment primarily focuses on policy
and control gaps.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and improve the overall cybersecurity
posture of Solid State, the following actionable recommendations are
provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Logins:</strong> Immediately
deploy and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication for all computer logins
across the organization. This will significantly reduce the risk of
unauthorized access due to compromised credentials, even if passwords
are stolen.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> Extend
MFA requirements to all systems that store or process sensitive
organizational or customer data. This critical step prevents
unauthorized access and potential data breaches, ensuring compliance and
data integrity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a comprehensive AUP that clearly outlines
employee responsibilities and acceptable conduct when using company IT
resources. Ensure all employees read, understand, and formally
acknowledge the policy to establish clear expectations and mitigate
misuse.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Initiate Security Awareness Training for New
Hires:</strong> Implement mandatory security awareness training as part
of the onboarding process for all new employees. This foundational
training will equip new staff with an understanding of cybersecurity
best practices, organizational policies, and common threats like
phishing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Annual Security Awareness Training for All
Employees:</strong> Establish a program for regular (at least annual)
security awareness training for all employees. Continuous education is
vital to keep staff informed about the latest evolving threats (e.g.,
sophisticated phishing techniques, social engineering tactics) and to
reinforce secure computing habits.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Regular Network Scans:</strong> Implement a
regular schedule for external and internal network vulnerability scans.
This proactive measure will help identify and remediate technical
vulnerabilities, outdated software, and misconfigurations before they
can be exploited.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Proactive Vulnerability Management:</strong> Establish a
robust process for regularly identifying, assessing, prioritizing, and
remediating vulnerabilities across the entire IT infrastructure. This
includes patching systems, updating software, and reviewing
configurations.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The assessment reveals that Solid State has a basic cybersecurity
foundation, particularly with MFA for email, but faces significant risks
due to critical gaps in broader MFA implementation, employee policy, and
security awareness training. Addressing these policy and human-factor
vulnerabilities should be the immediate priority. While no technical
scan findings were available for analysis in this report, implementing a
proactive and comprehensive vulnerability management program, including
regular network scans, is also crucial for a mature security posture. By
diligently implementing the recommended actions, Solid State can
substantially enhance its defense against cyber threats and protect its
valuable assets.</p>
