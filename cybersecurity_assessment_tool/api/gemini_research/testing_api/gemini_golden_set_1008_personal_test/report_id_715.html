<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of <strong>Prism
Logic</strong>, based on a review of organizational security controls, a
targeted network scan, and an assessment of existing risks. The analysis
reveals a posture with significant areas for improvement, particularly
concerning the implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
critical systems and comprehensive security awareness training. While
foundational security controls are present, the absence of MFA
introduces a substantial risk of unauthorized access. Technical findings
from the scan were minimal but highlight the presence of an open SSH
port, which requires diligent hardening. Immediate action on the
recommendations is crucial to elevate the organization’s security stance
and mitigate potential threats.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">3. Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>A limited network scan was performed on the specified target to
identify open ports and services.</p>

<p>The scan identified the following open ports:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 22 (TCP):</strong> Identified as open. This port
typically hosts SSH (Secure Shell) service. No specific service name,
product, or version information was available in the provided scan data
for this port.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: The provided scan data did not include detailed service
versioning or product information for identified open ports, limiting a
deeper technical vulnerability assessment. Further, more comprehensive
scanning is recommended to gather this critical information.</em></p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment">4. Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section correlates findings from the security control review and
technical scan results, along with any pre-existing risks, to identify
and categorize current cybersecurity risks.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="identified-risks">4.1. Identified Risks</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>R-01: Lack of MFA for Computer Logins</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for employee logins to computers. This
significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access should primary
credentials be compromised through methods such as phishing, keylogging,
or brute-force attacks. This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized
system access and potential lateral movement within the
network.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>R-02: Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Overview:</strong> Access to sensitive data systems does
not require MFA. This exposes critical organizational data to
unauthorized access, potential data breaches, and compliance violations
if a single factor of authentication (e.g., password) is
compromised.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>R-03: Insufficient Annual Security Awareness
Training</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive security
awareness training, the organization does not conduct annual training
for all employees. This leaves the workforce susceptible to evolving
social engineering tactics, phishing attacks, and general security
oversights due to a lack of regular reinforcement and updated knowledge
on current threats.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Severity:</strong> Medium</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>R-04: Open SSH Port (22)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Overview:</strong> An open SSH port was detected on the
target system. While SSH is a legitimate and secure protocol when
configured correctly, an open port without proper hardening (e.g.,
strong passwords/keys, disabled root login, restricted access,
up-to-date versions) represents a potential attack vector for
unauthorized remote access and command execution.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Severity:</strong> Medium (Conditional on hardening
status; potentially High if unhardened and exposed to internet)</p></li>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">5. Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and strengthen the overall
cybersecurity posture, the following actionable recommendations are
provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for All Computer Logins (Addressing
R-01):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mandate Multi-Factor Authentication for all user accounts
accessing organizational computers, especially those with network
access.</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluate and deploy suitable MFA solutions that align with
organizational needs and security requirements (e.g., hardware tokens,
authenticator applications, biometrics).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Enforce MFA for Sensitive Data System Access (Addressing
R-02):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Extend MFA requirements to all systems, applications, and
databases that store or process sensitive organizational data.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct an inventory of all sensitive data systems and prioritize
MFA implementation for the most critical assets to reduce the attack
surface.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Mandatory Annual Security Awareness Training
(Addressing R-03):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and implement a comprehensive annual security awareness
training program for all employees, not just new hires.</p></li>
<li><p>Include up-to-date topics such as phishing, social engineering,
password hygiene, data handling best practices, and incident reporting
procedures.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct regular simulated phishing campaigns to test employee
vigilance and reinforce training.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Harden and Monitor SSH Service (Addressing
R-04):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Immediately review and implement SSH hardening best
practices:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Disable password authentication and enforce strong, key-based
authentication.</p></li>
<li><p>Disable direct root login.</p></li>
<li><p>Limit SSH access to specific trusted IP addresses or internal
networks via firewall rules.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure SSH server software is kept up-to-date to patch known
vulnerabilities.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Implement robust logging and monitoring for SSH access attempts
to detect and respond to anomalous or malicious activity
promptly.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider utilizing a jump host or bastion host for SSH access to
further centralize and secure remote management.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Comprehensive Vulnerability
Scanning:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Perform regular, authenticated vulnerability scans to identify
specific service versions, configurations, and known vulnerabilities
across all accessible assets.</p></li>
<li><p>Integrate this into a continuous vulnerability management program
to ensure ongoing security posture assessment and improvement.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Prism Logic demonstrates a foundational understanding of
cybersecurity with some key controls in place. However, critical gaps in
Multi-Factor Authentication implementation across critical systems and
continuous security awareness training expose the organization to
significant and avoidable risks. By promptly addressing the identified
vulnerabilities and implementing the recommended controls, Prism Logic
can substantially improve its security posture, reduce its attack
surface, and decrease the likelihood and impact of a cyberattack.</p>
