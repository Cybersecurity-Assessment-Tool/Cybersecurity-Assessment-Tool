<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of <strong>Oasis
Wellness</strong> based on a review of organizational data, a security
questionnaire, and technical network scan results. Our assessment
identified several critical security gaps, primarily concerning the
absence of multi-factor authentication (MFA) for email and computer
access, an outdated web server, and a lack of an acceptable use policy.
Additionally, an SSL certificate mismatch was noted. Addressing these
items is crucial for enhancing the organization’s overall security
resilience and mitigating potential threats.</p>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This document presents a comprehensive cybersecurity assessment for
<strong>Oasis Wellness</strong>. The primary objective is to identify
current security strengths, weaknesses, and potential risks, thereby
providing actionable recommendations to improve the organization’s

<code>2025-11-22T10:00:00Z</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Organizational security questionnaire responses provided by
<strong>Oasis Wellness</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>A review of existing known vulnerabilities within the
organization (none reported in this instance).</p></li>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-questionnaire-gaps">Analysis of
Questionnaire Gaps</h2>
<p>The "No" responses in the questionnaire indicate significant gaps in
the organization’s security posture and expose potential attack
vectors:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Email Access:</strong> Email is a primary
vector for phishing and account compromise. Without MFA, compromised
credentials can grant attackers full access to an employee’s inbox,
potentially leading to business email compromise, data exfiltration, or
further internal network access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Computer Login:</strong> Similar to
email, access to user workstations or servers without MFA significantly
increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or
guessed. This can be a gateway to internal network lateral
movement.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> An AUP sets clear expectations for employee behavior
regarding the use of company IT resources. Without one, employees may
unknowingly engage in risky activities, and the organization lacks a
clear framework for addressing misuse or security incidents stemming
from user actions. This weakens the overall security culture.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on the internal host
<code>192.168.10.5</code> at <code>2025-11-22T10:00:00Z</code>. The scan
identified the following open port and service:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Host IP:</strong> <code>192.168.10.5</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Port:</strong> 443/TCP (Open)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Service:</strong> HTTPS</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Product:</strong> Nginx</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.18.0</p></li>
<li><p><strong>SSL Certificate Subject Common Name:</strong>
<code>www.acme-corp.com</code></p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="technical-analysis">Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>The network scan revealed critical technical vulnerabilities and
misconfigurations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Outdated Nginx Version (1.18.0):</strong> Nginx version
1.18.0 was released in April 2020. This version is significantly
outdated, with numerous security patches and feature updates having been
released in subsequent stable (e.g., 1.26.x) and mainline (e.g., 1.27.x)
versions. Running outdated software increases the risk of known
vulnerabilities being exploited, which could potentially lead to
denial-of-service, information disclosure, or even remote code
execution.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>SSL Certificate Common Name Mismatch:</strong> The SSL
certificate presented by the server at <code>192.168.10.5</code> has a
common name of <code>www.acme-corp.com</code>, which does not match the
organization’s stated website domain of
<code>www.OasisWellness.net</code>. While this specific scan was on an
internal IP address, such a mismatch indicates a potential
misconfiguration, the use of an incorrect certificate, or a server
repurposed without proper certificate updates. If this server were
publicly accessible and intended for <code>www.OasisWellness.net</code>,
this mismatch would cause browser warnings and distrust.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the questionnaire responses, technical scan
findings, and absence of prior reported vulnerabilities, the following
risks have been identified and assessed:</p>

</div>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and significantly improve the
overall cybersecurity posture of <strong>Oasis Wellness</strong>, the
following actionable recommendations are provided:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email and
Computer Access:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediately deploy and enforce MFA for
all employee email accounts and for logging into all company computers,
servers, and endpoints.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Drastically reduces the risk of
credential-based attacks, even if passwords are stolen or phished,
serving as a critical layer of defense.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> Critical</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Update Web Server Software (Nginx):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Plan and execute an upgrade of the Nginx
web server on <code>192.168.10.5</code> (and any other instances) to the
latest stable version (e.g., 1.26.x or newer). Ensure a proper testing
phase in a non-production environment before deployment to
production.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Patches known vulnerabilities, improves
performance, and ensures the server benefits from the latest security
features.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> High</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Draft, thoroughly review (involving
legal and HR), and formally implement an AUP that clearly outlines
employee responsibilities and acceptable conduct when using company IT
resources. Ensure all employees read, understand, and formally
acknowledge the policy upon hire and annually thereafter.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Establishes clear expectations, reduces
insider threats, provides a legal and ethical framework for IT resource
usage, and strengthens the overall security culture.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> High</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Review and Correct SSL Certificate
Configuration:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Investigate the SSL certificate on the
server at <code>192.168.10.5</code>. If this server is intended for
<code>www.OasisWellness.net</code>, replace the certificate with one
issued for the correct common name. If it’s an internal-only server,
ensure the certificate is appropriate for its intended use (e.g., a
wildcard certificate for an internal domain) and trusted by internal
clients.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Ensures proper trust, avoids browser
warnings (if externally facing), and maintains data integrity and
confidentiality for communications with the server.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> Medium</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The assessment reveals that while <strong>Oasis Wellness</strong> has
commendable security awareness training programs for new and existing
employees and has implemented MFA for sensitive data systems, there are
critical foundational security controls missing. Specifically, the
absence of MFA for general email and computer access, coupled with an
outdated Nginx web server and a lack of a formal acceptable use policy,
present significant vulnerabilities. Addressing these areas with the
provided recommendations will substantially enhance the organization’s
defensive capabilities against common cyber threats and foster a more
robust security posture.</p>
