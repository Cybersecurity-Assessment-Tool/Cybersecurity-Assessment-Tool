<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details a cybersecurity posture assessment for
<strong>Maple Leaf Logistics</strong>. The analysis synthesizes
available organizational data, security control responses, and attempts
to incorporate technical scan results and existing risk registers. Due
to limitations in the provided input data, specifically broken network
scan results and unavailable pre-existing vulnerability information,
this assessment primarily focuses on identified gaps in organizational
security controls. A critical finding is the absence of Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems, presenting a
significant risk. Comprehensive technical and risk analyses are
contingent upon the provision of complete and valid data.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-security-controls">Analysis of
Security Controls</h2>
<p><strong>Maple Leaf Logistics</strong> has implemented several
foundational security practices, including the use of MFA for email and
computer logins, maintaining an acceptable use policy, and conducting
regular security awareness training. These are positive indicators of a
proactive security stance.</p>
<p>However, a critical gap was identified: the lack of MFA requirement
for accessing sensitive data systems. This omission leaves critical
assets vulnerable to unauthorized access, particularly in scenarios
involving compromised credentials through phishing, malware, or
brute-force attacks. This represents a significant deviation from
industry best practices for protecting high-value information.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="target">Target: </h2>
<p>The provided network scan data (Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON) was
explicitly marked as broken and could not be parsed or analyzed.
Consequently, no technical vulnerabilities, open ports, service
versions, or product information could be extracted from a network
scanning perspective. A comprehensive technical assessment of the
organization’s external-facing infrastructure is not possible without
valid scan data.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the available information, the primary identified risk is
derived from the security control review. No network-based risks could
be identified due to the unavailability of scan data. Additionally,
pre-existing vulnerability data (Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON) was also
marked as broken, preventing its incorporation into this assessment.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risk and improve the overall cybersecurity
posture of <strong>Maple Leaf Logistics</strong>, the following
actionable recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Implementation of MFA for Sensitive Data
Systems:</strong> Prioritize and urgently implement Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for all systems, applications, and databases that
store, process, or transmit sensitive organizational or customer data.
This is the most critical immediate step to protect high-value
assets.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Provide Valid Network Scan Data:</strong> Furnish
complete and valid network scan results (e.g., Nmap scans) for all
public-facing IP addresses and critical internal subnets. This will
enable a thorough technical vulnerability assessment to identify
outdated software, misconfigurations, or exploitable services that could
be leveraged by attackers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Submit Existing Vulnerability Data:</strong> Provide
current internal vulnerability reports, penetration test results, or a
comprehensive risk register. This information is essential for
understanding the organization’s existing risk landscape and for
correlating with any future technical findings.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Security Posture Review:</strong> Establish a
schedule for regular, independent cybersecurity audits and assessments
that cover both technical vulnerabilities and the effectiveness of
administrative and organizational controls.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p><strong>Maple Leaf Logistics</strong> exhibits a foundation of
security awareness and policy implementation. However, the critical
vulnerability posed by the lack of MFA for sensitive data systems
requires immediate attention. Addressing this gap, coupled with
providing comprehensive technical and existing risk data for future
assessments, will be instrumental in significantly maturing the
organization’s cybersecurity resilience and protecting its valuable
assets.</p>
