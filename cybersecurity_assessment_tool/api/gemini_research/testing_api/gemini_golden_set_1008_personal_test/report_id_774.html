<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>Structure &amp; Form has undergone a cybersecurity posture
assessment. The review indicates a generally robust technical state
regarding external network exposure, with the latest scan showing
critical port 80 as closed. However, significant gaps were identified in
foundational security policies and ongoing employee training,
specifically the absence of a comprehensive employee acceptable use
policy and consistent annual security awareness training for all staff.
An existing vulnerability related to an unencrypted web server was
assessed and found to be mitigated based on current network scan data.
Recommendations are provided to address these findings and enhance the
overall security posture.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="detailed-port-scan-findings">Detailed Port
Scan Findings</h2>
<p>The scan identified the following status for key ports:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 80 (HTTP):</strong> State: <strong>Closed</strong>.
This indicates that no web server is currently listening on the standard
HTTP port on the target, which is a positive security posture. A closed
port reduces the attack surface for web-based vulnerabilities.</p></li>

<p>The scan identified no actively exploitable open ports or services
based on the provided data.</p>

<p>This section summarizes identified risks, combining gaps from the

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and enhance the overall cybersecurity
posture of Structure &amp; Form, the following actionable
recommendations are provided:</p>
<h2 id="policy-and-training-enhancements">Policy and Training
Enhancements</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a comprehensive AUP that clearly outlines
employee responsibilities, acceptable use of company IT resources (e.g.,
internet, email, software), data handling procedures, and security
protocols. Ensure this policy is communicated to all employees, and
obtain documented acknowledgment of understanding and
compliance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Mandatory Annual Security Awareness Training
for All Employees:</strong> Implement a regular, mandatory security
awareness training program for all employees, not just new hires. This
training should be conducted at least once per year and cover current
threats such as phishing, ransomware, social engineering, password best
practices, and incident reporting procedures. Track employee
participation and completion rates.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="technical-and-process-improvements">Technical and Process
Improvements</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Maintain a Minimal Attack Surface:</strong> Continue the
practice of ensuring that only strictly necessary ports and services are
exposed to internal and external networks. Regularly review and audit
firewall rules, network configurations, and exposed services to
proactively close or secure any unnecessary access points.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Regular Security Assessments:</strong> Supplement
internal reviews with periodic external vulnerability assessments and
penetration tests. This proactive approach helps to identify and address
security weaknesses from an attacker’s perspective before they can be
exploited.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Maintain an Accurate Risk Register:</strong> Implement a
process to regularly review and update the organization’s risk register.
Ensure that all identified risks, including those from previous
assessments, are accurately documented with their current status (e.g.,
open, mitigated, closed) based on the latest assessments and remedial
actions.</p></li>
