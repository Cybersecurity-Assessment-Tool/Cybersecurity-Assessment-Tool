<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of Skyward Bound, based
on provided organizational data, a security questionnaire review, and a
technical network scan. The assessment reveals several critical gaps in
foundational security controls, primarily identified through the
questionnaire. While no external network vulnerabilities were identified
from the provided scan data (as it was empty), the absence of
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, a formal Acceptable Use
Policy (AUP), and dedicated security awareness training for new
employees present significant risks. These areas require immediate
attention to enhance the organization’s overall security resilience
against common cyber threats.</p>

<h2 id="nmap-scan-findings">Nmap Scan Findings</h2>
<p>The provided Nmap scan data for <code>[Target IP]</code> was empty,
indicating no open ports or services were identified, or the scan did
not yield any results. Therefore, no specific technical findings
regarding network services, software versions, or potential
vulnerabilities could be extracted from the scan results.</p>

<td style="text-align: left;">New employees are often unaware of an
organization’s specific security policies, common threats (e.g.,
phishing, social engineering), and incident reporting procedures.
Without immediate and mandatory training, they are significantly more
susceptible to attacks, potentially compromising company security from
their first day.</td>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and enhance the overall cybersecurity
posture of Skyward Bound, the following recommendations are
provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email
Access:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Enable and enforce MFA for all email accounts across the
organization. This significantly reduces the risk of credential
compromise leading to unauthorized access, even if passwords are
stolen.</p></li>
<li><p>Educate employees on the importance and usage of MFA.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Draft a comprehensive AUP that clearly outlines the acceptable
use of all company IT resources, data, and communication
systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure the AUP covers data handling, internet usage, software
installation, personal device usage (if applicable), and reporting
security incidents.</p></li>
<li><p>Obtain acknowledgment of understanding and compliance from all
employees.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Mandatory Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and integrate a mandatory security awareness training
module into the onboarding process for all new hires.</p></li>
<li><p>This training should cover topics such as phishing
identification, password hygiene, safe internet practices, data
classification, and the company’s AUP.</p></li>
<li><p>Reinforce these concepts with regular, ongoing training for all
employees, as is already being done annually.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Regular External Vulnerability Scans and
Penetration Tests:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Although the provided scan data was empty, it is crucial to
routinely perform authenticated and unauthenticated vulnerability scans
of all external-facing assets.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider engaging third-party cybersecurity firms for periodic
penetration tests to identify potential weaknesses that automated scans
might miss.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish an Incident Response Plan (IRP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and document a clear Incident Response Plan to
effectively prepare for, detect, respond to, and recover from
cybersecurity incidents.</p></li>
<li><p>Regularly test the IRP through tabletop exercises to ensure its
effectiveness and refine processes.</p></li>
</ul></li>

<h1 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h1>
<p>This report is based solely on the information provided by the client
and the results of the conducted technical scans (or lack thereof).
While every effort has been made to provide accurate and actionable
insights, cybersecurity is an evolving field, and new threats emerge
regularly. These recommendations should be considered as a baseline for
improvement and not an exhaustive list of all possible security
measures. Regular reviews and updates to security policies and controls
are essential. For further information on cybersecurity best practices,
resources such as the NIST Cybersecurity Framework () or ISO/IEC 27001
are highly recommended.</p>
