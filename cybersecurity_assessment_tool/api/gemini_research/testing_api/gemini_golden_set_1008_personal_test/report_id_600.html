<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment conducted for <strong>Paper Plane Publishing</strong>. The
assessment is based on an analysis of provided organizational data and
responses to a security questionnaire.</p>
<p>It is important to note the following data limitations for this
assessment:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>No Network Scan Data:</strong> No network scan results
were provided or available for technical analysis. Therefore, this
report cannot comment on open ports, running services, software
versions, or potential network-level vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Existing Risk Register Data:</strong> No pre-existing
risk register data was provided. This report’s risk assessment is solely
based on the security questionnaire responses and general cybersecurity
best practices.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Despite these limitations, the questionnaire responses reveal several
critical security gaps, primarily concerning Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) implementation and foundational security awareness and policy
enforcement. Addressing these identified areas is paramount for
enhancing the organization’s overall security posture and mitigating
significant risks. Key recommendations include the widespread adoption
of MFA, the establishment of a comprehensive Acceptable Use Policy, and
robust, regular security awareness training for all employees.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">3. Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>No network scan data was provided for this assessment. Therefore, a
technical analysis of the organization’s network perimeter, open ports,
running services, product versions, and potential software
vulnerabilities could not be conducted. The absence of this data
significantly limits the scope of the technical security posture
evaluation.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="existing-risk-register-review">4. Existing
Risk Register Review</h1>
<p>No existing risk register data was provided for analysis. This
prevents correlation with any previously identified vulnerabilities or

efforts or ongoing risk exposure beyond the scope of the
questionnaire.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">6. Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and improve the overall cybersecurity
posture of Paper Plane Publishing, the following recommendations are
provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Logins:</strong> Deploy and
enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer login
processes across the organization. This significantly reduces the risk
of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials, even if passwords
are stolen or guessed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong>
Mandate MFA for access to all systems containing sensitive or critical
organizational data. Prioritize systems based on data classification,
regulatory requirements, and the potential impact of a breach.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a clear, comprehensive AUP outlining employee
responsibilities for secure IT resource usage, data handling, internet
conduct, and prohibited activities. Ensure all employees acknowledge,
understand, and adhere to the policy through regular training and signed
agreements.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Mandatory Onboarding Security
Training:</strong> Implement mandatory security awareness training as a
core part of the onboarding process for all new employees. This training
should cover common threats (e.g., phishing, social engineering),
organizational policies, password hygiene, and incident reporting
procedures from day one.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Annual Security Awareness Training:</strong>
Schedule and deliver mandatory security awareness training for all
employees at least once per year. This training should be updated
regularly to reflect current threat landscapes, reinforce secure
behaviors, and remind employees of their role in maintaining
organizational security. Consider supplementary training modules for
specific roles or high-risk topics.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Consider Comprehensive Security Assessments:</strong>
While not part of this assessment due to data limitations, it is
strongly recommended to conduct regular, comprehensive security
assessments. This should include network vulnerability scanning,
penetration testing, and a detailed review of internal security
configurations to gain a complete understanding of the organization’s
attack surface and risk exposure.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These recommendations, once implemented, will significantly
strengthen Paper Plane Publishing’s security controls, reduce its attack
surface, and enhance its resilience against common cyber threats.</p>
