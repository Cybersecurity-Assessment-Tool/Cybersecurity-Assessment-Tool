<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This document details the findings of a cybersecurity assessment
conducted for <strong>Maple Leaf Logistics</strong>. The assessment
involved a three-pronged approach: a technical network scan, a review of
organizational security controls via a questionnaire, and an analysis of
existing risk documentation. The objective is to provide a holistic view
of the current security posture, identify vulnerabilities and risks, and
offer actionable recommendations for improvement.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following information was provided by <strong>Maple Leaf
Logistics</strong> to establish organizational context for this
assessment.</p>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A security questionnaire was completed by <strong>Maple Leaf
Logistics</strong> to assess the implementation of foundational security
controls. The responses are summarized below:</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-questionnaire-findings">Analysis of Questionnaire
Findings</h2>
<p>The review of security controls reveals a mixed posture. While the
organization demonstrates good practices in employee training and
acceptable use policies, critical gaps exist regarding Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA). The absence of MFA for email access and sensitive
data systems presents significant attack vectors that could lead to
unauthorized access and data breaches.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed against the designated target to
identify open ports, services, and potential vulnerabilities.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Target:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Used:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> No specific scan date provided in
input.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Nmap scan indicated that the host was <strong>up</strong>, but
<strong>no open ports were detected</strong>. All common ports were
reported as closed.</p>
<h2 id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of Technical
Findings</h2>
<p>The absence of open ports on the scanned host is a positive
indicator, suggesting a hardened external (or internal, depending on
context of the target IP) perimeter from a network service perspective.
This minimizes the attack surface accessible via network-based exploits
targeting common services. However, it’s crucial to note that this scan
is a snapshot and does not preclude the existence of vulnerabilities
within internal applications, misconfigurations, or other attack vectors
not detectable by a port scan. Furthermore, internal network segments or
other hosts were not part of this specific scan, so this finding applies
only to the target .</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the security questionnaire, technical scan
results, and current risk register, the following risks have been
identified:</p>

</div>
<h2 id="summary-of-existing-vulnerabilities">Summary of Existing
Vulnerabilities</h2>
<p>The provided current risk register (Input 3) did not list any
pre-existing vulnerabilities for <strong>Maple Leaf Logistics</strong>.
This assessment’s identified risks are derived directly from the
security control review.</p>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and enhance the overall cybersecurity
posture of <strong>Maple Leaf Logistics</strong>, the following
recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Access:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediately deploy and enforce
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all user accounts accessing
organizational email.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> This will significantly reduce the risk
of email account compromise through stolen credentials, phishing, or
brute-force attacks, protecting sensitive communications and preventing
impersonation.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Mandate MFA for all access to systems
containing sensitive organizational data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> This critical control adds an essential
layer of security, safeguarding valuable data even if primary user
credentials are compromised.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Security Assessments:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Conduct periodic vulnerability
assessments and penetration tests, including internal network scans, to
identify and address potential weaknesses before they can be
exploited.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Proactive identification of
vulnerabilities reduces the risk of successful cyberattacks.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Continuous Security Awareness Training
(Reinforcement):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> While current training is good,
continuously reinforce the importance of strong passwords, identifying
phishing attempts, and the benefits of MFA through ongoing campaigns and
simulated attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> A well-informed workforce is the first
line of defense against many cyber threats.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p><strong>Maple Leaf Logistics</strong> exhibits a commendable stance
on employee security awareness and maintains a tight external network
perimeter for the scanned host. However, the critical absence of
Multi-Factor Authentication for email and sensitive data systems poses
substantial risks that could lead to significant security incidents.
Addressing these MFA gaps should be the highest priority to fortify the
organization’s defenses and protect its critical assets.</p>
