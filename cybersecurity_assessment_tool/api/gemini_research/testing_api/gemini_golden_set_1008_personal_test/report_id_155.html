<p>This document presents a comprehensive cybersecurity assessment based
on three distinct data inputs: a network scan, organizational security
data, and a list of pre-existing risks. The objective is to analyze,
correlate, and synthesize this information to provide a clear overview
of the current security posture, highlight critical vulnerabilities and
gaps, and offer prioritized recommendations for remediation.</p>

<p>A network scan was conducted on the target . The scan aimed to

<h3 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of
Technical Findings</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 22 (SSH) Open:</strong> Port 22 is commonly used for
the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol, which allows for secure remote access.
While SSH itself is a secure protocol, its exposure, especially on
localhost, warrants attention. Without specific service, product, and
version information from the scan, it is not possible to assess for
known vulnerabilities in the SSH implementation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Service/Version Information:</strong> The scan
did not provide details regarding the service, product, or version
running on port 22. This lack of information is a finding itself, as it
limits the ability to thoroughly assess potential software-specific
vulnerabilities.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section consolidates risks identified from the security
questionnaire, technical scan, and pre-existing vulnerability data.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="summary-of-identified-risks">Summary of
Identified Risks</h2>
<p>The assessment identified several critical and high-priority risks
primarily stemming from organizational policy gaps and a pre-existing
high-severity vulnerability. While the technical scan on localhost
showed minimal direct vulnerabilities, the lack of detailed service
information on an open port is noted as an informational risk.</p>

<strong>Risk Name</strong> &amp; <strong>Overview</strong> &amp;
<strong>Severity</strong> &amp; <strong>Affected Elements</strong><br />
<br />
Localhost Exposed &amp; A critical vulnerability indicating a
potentially exposed internal service or configuration issue. &amp;
&amp;<br />
Missing Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) &amp; Lack of a formal AUP
leaves employees without clear guidelines on acceptable technology use,
increasing risks of misuse, data breaches, and non-compliance. &amp;
&amp; Organizational Policy<br />
Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training &amp; Without regular
security awareness training, employees are more susceptible to social
engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) and may not follow best security
practices, increasing organizational risk. &amp; &amp; All
Employees<br />
Open SSH Port without Version Information &amp; An open SSH port,
particularly on a potentially internal system, without detailed version
information, prevents proper vulnerability assessment. While not
inherently a vulnerability, it represents an unknown risk. &amp;

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the provided data, the following
recommendations are put forth to improve Neon Pulse Entertainment’s
cybersecurity posture.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Address Localhost Exposure (Critical):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Immediately investigate the "Localhost Exposed" vulnerability
with a CVSS score of 10.0. Determine the root cause and purpose of this
exposure.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement appropriate access controls, network segmentation, or
disable unnecessary services to mitigate this critical risk.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(High):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) that
clearly defines expectations for employee behavior regarding company IT
resources, data handling, internet usage, and security
practices.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all employees read, understand, and formally acknowledge
the AUP. Integrate this into the onboarding process and periodic
reviews.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Annual Security Awareness Training
(High):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement mandatory annual security awareness training for all
employees, reinforcing topics covered during new hire training and
introducing new threat landscapes (e.g., advanced phishing techniques,
ransomware trends).</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct periodic simulated phishing campaigns to assess and
improve employee vigilance.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Enhance Network Scanning for Service Versioning
(Informational):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Future network scans should aim to identify detailed service,
product, and version information for all open ports. This is crucial for
accurately assessing potential vulnerabilities (e.g., outdated software
with known CVEs).</p></li>
<li><p>For the currently identified open Port 22 on , conduct a more
detailed scan or manual investigation to determine the exact service and
version running. Ensure it is patched and configured securely.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Maintain Strong MFA Practices (Strength):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Continue to enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email
access, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. This is a critical
security control and a significant strength in the current
posture.</p></li>
<li><p>Regularly review MFA implementations for effectiveness and user
experience, adapting as new technologies emerge.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Neon Pulse Entertainment demonstrates a foundational commitment to
security by implementing MFA across key access points and providing
initial security awareness training. However, critical gaps exist in
formal policy documentation (AUP), continuous security education (annual
training), and the resolution of an existing critical vulnerability
("Localhost Exposed"). Addressing these identified risks and
implementing the provided recommendations will significantly strengthen
the organization’s overall cybersecurity posture against evolving
threats.</p>
