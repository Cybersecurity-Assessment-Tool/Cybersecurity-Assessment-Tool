<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of Arcane Security,
based on an analysis of provided network scan data, organizational
security questionnaire responses, and a list of existing organizational
risks. The assessment highlights both strengths and areas requiring
immediate attention.</p>
<p>Key findings include a robust external network posture for the
scanned target, with no open ports identified. However, a significant
organizational vulnerability was identified due to the absence of
mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees, which is
categorized as a critical gap. Additionally, a pre-existing risk
concerning an "Unencrypted Web Server" was noted. The provided network
scan data did not corroborate this on the specific target scanned,
suggesting it may have been remediated or applies to a different
system.</p>
<p>Recommendations focus on addressing the critical training gap,
verifying the status of pre-existing risks, and maintaining the current
strong external network posture.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="introduction">1. Introduction</h1>
<p>This document presents a cybersecurity posture assessment for Arcane
Security. The assessment is compiled from three distinct data
sources:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Network Scan Data (Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON):</strong>
Provides information on identified hosts, open ports, and
services.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Organizational Data (Input_2_Org_Data_JSON):</strong>
Contains general company information and responses to key security
control questions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Current Risks Data (Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON):</strong>
Lists pre-existing vulnerabilities and risks identified within the
organization.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The objective of this report is to analyze and synthesize these
inputs to provide a holistic view of the organization’s current security
standing, identify critical gaps, and propose actionable recommendations
for improvement.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-security-controls">3.1. Analysis
of Security Controls</h2>
<p>Arcane Security demonstrates a strong commitment to several
foundational security controls, notably the widespread implementation of
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across email, computer logins, and
sensitive data systems. The presence of an acceptable use policy and
security awareness training for new employees are also positive
indicators.</p>
<p>However, a critical gap exists concerning the regularity of security
awareness training. The absence of mandatory annual security awareness
training for all employees poses a significant organizational risk. This
lack can lead to employees becoming susceptible to evolving phishing
attacks, social engineering, and other common cyber threats, thereby
increasing the likelihood of successful breaches due to human error.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">4. Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was conducted on the target . The scan utilized ‘nmap‘
as the scanner.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target Host:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not provided in input data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> Up</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="port-scan-findings">4.1. Port Scan
Findings</h2>
<p>The Nmap scan results for indicated that no open ports were found.
Specifically, port <code>80</code> was identified as
<code>closed</code>. This suggests a minimal external attack surface for
the scanned host.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Note on Discrepancy:</strong> It is important to note that a
separate "Current Risks" input listed "Unencrypted Web Server" with the
overview "Port 80 is open." The live network scan on explicitly found
port 80 to be <code>closed</code>. This suggests that either the
identified risk pertains to a different host not included in this scan,
or the risk has been remediated on the scanned target. Further
investigation is recommended to reconcile this information.</p>

</div>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="risk-analysis">5.1. Risk Analysis</h2>
<p>The most immediate and impactful risk identified is the absence of
annual security awareness training. This directly impacts the human
element, which is often cited as the weakest link in cybersecurity.
While new employees receive training, a single, initial session is
insufficient to keep pace with evolving threat landscapes.</p>
<p>The pre-existing "Unencrypted Web Server" risk has a moderate
severity. The fact that the current scan did not confirm an open port 80
on the target is a positive sign. However, it is crucial to verify if
this risk has been fully remediated across all relevant organizational
assets or if it applies to other systems not included in the scope of
the provided network scan data.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">6. Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the assessment, the following recommendations are provided
to enhance Arcane Security’s cybersecurity posture:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Mandatory Annual Security Awareness Training
(High Priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and implement a comprehensive annual security awareness
training program for <u>all</u> employees.</p></li>
<li><p>Training should cover topics such as phishing detection, social
engineering tactics, password hygiene, data handling best practices, and
incident reporting procedures.</p></li>
<li><p>Utilize engaging and up-to-date training modules to ensure
effectiveness.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Verify "Unencrypted Web Server" Risk Status (Medium
Priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Conduct a full inventory of all external-facing web servers and
verify their encryption status.</p></li>
<li><p>If any unencrypted web servers are found (especially on port 80),
implement HTTPS (SSL/TLS) to encrypt all traffic.</p></li>
<li><p>If the previous risk assessment pertained to and it is now
confirmed closed, document the remediation steps.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Maintain Strong External Network Posture (Ongoing
Priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Continue to regularly scan external IP addresses and ranges to
identify any newly opened or misconfigured ports.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure only absolutely necessary services are exposed to the
internet and are properly secured with strong configurations and timely
patching.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Review and Update Acceptable Use Policy (Low
Priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Periodically review the existing employee acceptable use policy
to ensure it remains current with technological advancements and
evolving threat landscapes.</p></li>
<li><p>Communicate any updates effectively to all employees.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">7. Conclusion</h1>
<p>Arcane Security demonstrates a foundational understanding of
cybersecurity, evidenced by its MFA implementation and initial employee
training. However, the identified critical gap in ongoing security
awareness training presents a notable vulnerability. By addressing this
gap and proactively verifying existing risks, Arcane Security can
significantly strengthen its overall security posture and build a more
resilient defense against cyber threats.</p>
