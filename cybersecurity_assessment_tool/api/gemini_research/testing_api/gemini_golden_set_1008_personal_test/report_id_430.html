<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">1. Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for <strong>Harbor Light Foundation</strong>. The analysis is based on
organizational security control self-assessment, a network vulnerability
scan (if data available), and a review of existing organizational
risks.</p>
<p>The current assessment highlights several critical security gaps,
primarily concerning the implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) for key systems and the lack of robust security awareness training
programs. While no technical vulnerabilities were identified via network
scan (due to lack of scan data), and no pre-existing risks were
reported, the identified control deficiencies introduce significant
potential for compromise. Addressing these gaps is paramount to
improving the organization’s overall security posture.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">4. Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was initiated for target <code>[Target IP]</code>.
However, no active scan data or open ports were reported in the provided
input. Therefore, no technical vulnerabilities can be identified or
reported from this section at this time. It is recommended to conduct an
active authenticated vulnerability scan if possible, or provide more
detailed network scan data for a comprehensive technical assessment.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment">5. Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the provided data, several key risks and
vulnerabilities have been identified. These are primarily derived from
the self-assessment of security controls.</p>

<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Lack of MFA for Email
Access</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Email accounts are a primary target for
phishing and compromise. Without MFA, a simple password breach can lead
to full account takeover, impacting data confidentiality, integrity, and
potentially leading to further network compromise.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>No Security Awareness Training for
New Employees</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">New employees are often unfamiliar with an
organization’s specific security policies and common threats, making
them susceptible to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing). Lack of
training increases the human element risk.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>No Annual Security Awareness
Training</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Without regular security awareness

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">6. Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and strengthen the cybersecurity
posture of <strong>Harbor Light Foundation</strong>, the following
recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email
Accounts (Critical):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Mandate and enforce MFA for all email
accounts across the organization.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Significantly reduces the risk of
account compromise from phishing or stolen credentials.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive
Data Systems (Critical):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Deploy and require MFA for access to all
systems containing or processing sensitive organizational data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Provides an essential layer of
security, protecting critical data from unauthorized access even if
primary credentials are breached.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Security Awareness Training for New Employees
(High):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop and implement a mandatory
security awareness training program for all new hires during their
onboarding process.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Ensures new employees are aware of
organizational security policies, common threats (e.g., phishing), and
their role in maintaining security from day one.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Annual Security Awareness Training for All
Employees (High):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Conduct mandatory, regular (at least
annual) security awareness training for all employees.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Keeps employees updated on evolving
threats, reinforces best practices, and fosters a continuous
security-conscious culture.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Regular Vulnerability Scanning and Penetration
Testing (General):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Implement a schedule for external and
internal vulnerability scans, and consider periodic penetration testing
to identify technical weaknesses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Proactively identifies technical
vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers, providing
actionable intelligence for remediation.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">7. Conclusion</h1>
<p>While <strong>Harbor Light Foundation</strong> demonstrates some
foundational security practices (e.g., MFA for computer login, AUP),
critical gaps exist concerning MFA for email and sensitive data, and
comprehensive security awareness training. Addressing these identified
high-priority items will significantly enhance the organization’s
defense against common cyber threats and improve its overall resilience.
Continuous monitoring and a proactive approach to cybersecurity are
recommended to maintain a strong security posture in the face of
evolving threats.</p>
