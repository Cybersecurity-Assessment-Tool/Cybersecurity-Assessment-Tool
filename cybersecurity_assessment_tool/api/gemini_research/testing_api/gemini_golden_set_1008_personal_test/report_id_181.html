<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of Vivid Vision, based
on an analysis of provided organizational data, security questionnaire
responses, and a targeted network scan. The assessment identified
several critical areas for improvement. While the organization
demonstrates good practices in some areas, such as Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for email and an acceptable use policy, significant
gaps exist in MFA coverage for computer logins and sensitive data
systems, as well as the frequency of security awareness training.
Furthermore, a technical scan revealed an outdated web server, posing a
significant vulnerability due to its End-of-Life (EOL) status.
Addressing these issues is paramount to enhancing Vivid Vision’s overall
security resilience against modern cyber threats.</p>

</div>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-questionnaire-gaps">Analysis of
Questionnaire Gaps</h2>
<p>The questionnaire responses indicate critical gaps in two primary
areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> The lack of
MFA requirements for both computer logins and access to sensitive data
systems represents a significant vulnerability. Without MFA, a single
compromised password could lead to unauthorized access, potentially
escalating to full system compromise or data breaches, and bypassing
existing perimeter defenses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Security Awareness Training:</strong> While new employees
receive initial training, the absence of annual security awareness
training for all employees leaves the organization exposed to evolving
social engineering tactics, phishing, and other human-centric attacks,
as threats and attack vectors continuously change.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on the target IP address
<code>192.168.10.5</code>. The scan was conducted on UTC.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="summary-of-open-ports-and-services">Summary
of Open Ports and Services</h2>
<p>The following open ports and services were identified:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 443 (TCP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Service:</strong> HTTPS</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Product:</strong> Nginx</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.18.0 <strong>SSL Certificate
Subject:</strong> <code>commonName=www.acme-corp.com</code></p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="technical-vulnerability-analysis">Technical
Vulnerability Analysis</h2>
<p>The primary technical vulnerability identified is the use of an
outdated Nginx web server version. Nginx 1.18.0 was released in April
2020 and is an End-of-Life (EOL) mainline version. This means it no
longer receives security updates or patches for newly discovered
vulnerabilities. Operating EOL software significantly increases the
attack surface and exposes the web server to known, unpatched CVEs,
making it a prime target for attackers and increasing the risk of
compromise.</p>

<p>This section consolidates the identified risks from the questionnaire
analysis and technical scan results, along with their assessed

Vulnerabilities</h2>
<p>No pre-existing vulnerabilities were reported in the provided data.
The risks identified above are derived directly from the current
assessment findings.</p>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and significantly enhance Vivid
Vision’s cybersecurity posture, the following actionable recommendations
are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer
Logins:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Deploy a robust MFA solution across all employee workstations and
servers within the organization’s network.</p></li>
<li><p>Enforce mandatory MFA for all user logins to company computers,
especially those accessing internal resources or corporate networks, to
prevent unauthorized access even with compromised passwords.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive
Data Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Conduct an inventory of all systems that store, process, or
transmit sensitive organizational or customer data (e.g., HR systems,
financial applications, customer databases).</p></li>
<li><p>Integrate and enforce MFA for access to these critical systems,
regardless of whether they are accessed locally or remotely, to protect
against sophisticated credential-based attacks.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Mandatory Annual Security Awareness Training
for All Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and implement a comprehensive security awareness training
program that is mandatory for all employees, not just new
hires.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure training is conducted at least annually and covers current
threat landscapes, including sophisticated phishing techniques,
ransomware, social engineering tactics, and best practices for data
handling and incident reporting.</p></li>
<li><p>Track employee completion and understanding of the training to
ensure its effectiveness.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade and Maintain Nginx Web Server:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Immediately plan and execute an upgrade of the Nginx web server
to the latest stable mainline or stable production-ready branch version
(e.g., Nginx 1.24.x or newer). This will ensure the server benefits from
the latest security patches and bug fixes.</p></li>
<li><p>Establish a regular patch management policy to ensure all
software, including web servers, operating systems, and applications,
are kept up-to-date with the latest security updates.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct thorough testing after the upgrade to ensure continued
functionality and compatibility of hosted applications and
services.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Vivid Vision has demonstrated foundational security controls in place
for email MFA and employee policies. However, this assessment highlights
significant vulnerabilities related to broader MFA adoption, continuous
security awareness training, and the use of outdated software in its web
infrastructure. Proactively addressing the identified risks and
implementing the recommended remediation steps will substantially
strengthen Vivid Vision’s defense against contemporary cyber threats,
reduce the likelihood of successful attacks, and protect critical
organizational assets and data. Continued vigilance and a commitment to
ongoing security improvements are essential in today’s evolving threat
landscape.</p>
