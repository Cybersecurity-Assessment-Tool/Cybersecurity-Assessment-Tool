<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This document presents the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment for <strong>Moxie Marketing</strong>. The assessment is based
on the analysis and correlation of provided organizational information,
a security questionnaire, and an attempt to integrate technical scan
data and existing vulnerability records. Unfortunately, the provided
technical scan data and existing risk data were incomplete, which
significantly limited the scope of a full technical security review.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following organizational details were extracted from the provided
data.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Organization Name:</strong> Moxie Marketing</p></li>

<h1 id="security-control-review-questionnaire-analysis">Security Control
Review: Questionnaire Analysis</h1>
<p>A review of the security questionnaire responses reveals the
organization’s current stance on several key security controls.
Responses indicate a strong implementation of Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA), which is a critical security measure. However,
notable gaps exist concerning employee policies and initial security
awareness training.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis, the following actionable recommendations are
provided to improve the cybersecurity posture of <strong>Moxie
Marketing</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create a clear, concise AUP that outlines acceptable and
unacceptable use of company IT systems, networks, and data.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all employees review and acknowledge the AUP, ideally
during onboarding and annually thereafter.</p></li>
<li><p>Integrate AUP principles into ongoing security awareness
training.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Mandatory Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Establish a mandatory security awareness training program for all
new hires, to be completed before granting full system access.</p></li>
<li><p>Cover topics such as phishing identification, password best
practices, data handling, and reporting suspicious activities.</p></li>
<li><p>Reinforce this initial training with regular (at least annual)
refresher courses for all employees, as already indicated by the
organization.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct a Full Network Scan and Vulnerability
Assessment:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Procure or generate valid and complete network scan data (e.g.,
Nmap or similar tools) for all external-facing assets.</p></li>
<li><p>Engage in regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing
to identify and remediate technical weaknesses.</p></li>
<li><p>Review open ports, services, and software versions for potential
vulnerabilities and unnecessary exposure.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Provide Comprehensive Existing Vulnerability
Data:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Collect and provide detailed information on all currently
identified vulnerabilities, including their descriptions, severity, and
remediation status.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement a robust vulnerability management program to
continuously identify, assess, prioritize, and remediate security
flaws.</p></li>
<li><p>Utilize a centralized vulnerability management system to track
and report on the organization’s security posture.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>While <strong>Moxie Marketing</strong> has commendably implemented
Multi-Factor Authentication across key access points, significant risks
stem from the absence of an Employee Acceptable Use Policy and critical
security awareness training for new employees. Furthermore, the
inability to access technical scan data and existing vulnerability
records presents a critical blind spot, preventing a holistic
understanding of the organization’s overall security posture. Addressing
the identified policy and training gaps, alongside providing complete
technical and vulnerability data for future assessments, will be crucial
steps in fortifying the organization’s defenses against evolving cyber
threats.</p>
