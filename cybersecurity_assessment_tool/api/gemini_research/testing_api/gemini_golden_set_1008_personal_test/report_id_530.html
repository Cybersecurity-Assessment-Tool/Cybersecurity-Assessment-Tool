<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture assessment for
<strong>Vanguard Heritage</strong>, conducted on 2026-01-27. The
assessment involved a comprehensive review of organizational security
controls through a structured questionnaire, an internal network scan,
and an analysis of existing reported risks.</p>
<p>Key findings indicate several critical vulnerabilities and
significant security gaps. From a technical standpoint, an exposed FTP
service on target <code>10.0.0.15</code> running an outdated
<code>vsftpd 2.3.4</code> with anonymous access enabled presents an
immediate and severe risk of data breach, unauthorized access, and
system compromise. Furthermore, the organization lacks Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for email access, does not have a formal Employee
Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), and fails to provide essential security
awareness training for new employees. These policy and procedural
shortcomings significantly increase the organization’s overall attack
surface through social engineering and internal policy violations.
Additionally, existing risks include the use of outdated operating
systems (Windows 7), which are beyond their end-of-life and susceptible
to unpatched vulnerabilities. Immediate action is strongly recommended
to address these critical findings and proactively improve the
organization’s cybersecurity posture.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-security-control-gaps">Analysis
of Security Control Gaps</h2>
<p>The security control review reveals several significant policy and
procedural deficiencies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>No MFA for Email Access:</strong> Email remains a primary
vector for phishing and credential theft attacks. The absence of
Multi-Factor Authentication for email accounts leaves them highly
vulnerable to compromise, potentially leading to unauthorized access to
sensitive communications and systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong>
Without a formal AUP, employees may be unaware of their responsibilities
regarding the proper use of company IT assets, data handling procedures,
and security protocols. This increases the risk of misuse, inadvertent
data leakage, and security incidents stemming from employee
actions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong> New employees are typically more susceptible to
social engineering and phishing attacks due to a lack of familiarization
with organizational security practices. The absence of initial security
awareness training makes them potential weak links in the security
chain, increasing the risk of external compromise.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An Nmap network scan was performed on the internal target
<code>10.0.0.15</code>. The scan results identified the following
critical vulnerabilities and misconfigurations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> 2026-01-27</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Target Host:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports and Services:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 21/TCP (FTP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Service:</strong> File Transfer Protocol (FTP)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Product:</strong> <code>vsftpd</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Version:</strong> <code>2.3.4</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Details:</strong> <code>vsftpd</code> version 2.3.4,
released in 2011, is severely outdated and contains known critical
vulnerabilities. Notably, this version has been associated with specific
backdoors and numerous other security flaws that can be exploited by
malicious actors. Operating such an old version in production poses a
significant and immediate exploitation risk.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Configuration Issue: Anonymous FTP Login
Allowed:</strong> The scan confirmed that anonymous FTP login is
permitted on this service. This critical misconfiguration allows any
unauthorized user to connect to the FTP server without providing
credentials. Depending on the server’s configuration, this could lead to
information disclosure (e.g., listing directories, downloading sensitive
files), unauthorized file uploads, or even full system
compromise.</p></li>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the comprehensive assessment, the following recommendations
are provided to mitigate identified risks and substantially improve the
overall cybersecurity posture of Vanguard Heritage. These
recommendations are prioritized by severity.</p>
<h2 id="immediate-actions-critical-high-severity">Immediate Actions
(Critical &amp; High Severity)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Disable Anonymous FTP &amp; Secure/Remove FTP
Service:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Action:</strong> Disable anonymous FTP login on
without delay.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Determine if the FTP service is
truly essential for business operations. If not, the service should be
completely removed to eliminate the attack surface.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade/Replace:</strong> If FTP functionality is
required, upgrade <code>vsftpd</code> to the latest stable and supported
version. Alternatively, migrate to a more secure file transfer protocol
such as SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) or SCP (Secure Copy Protocol),
which leverage encryption and stronger authentication
mechanisms.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Access:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement and strictly enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
for all organizational email accounts. This critical security control
significantly reduces the risk of credential-based attacks, even if
passwords are compromised.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Draft, formally implement, and communicate a comprehensive AUP
that clearly outlines the proper use of company IT resources, data
handling best practices, and security expectations for all
employees.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all employees read and acknowledge their understanding and
agreement to abide by the AUP.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Mandate Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Integrate mandatory, role-specific security awareness training as
a fundamental part of the onboarding process for all new
employees.</p></li>
<li><p>The training should cover essential topics such as identifying
phishing attempts, social engineering tactics, strong password hygiene,
data classification, and incident reporting procedures.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mid-term-actions-medium-severity">Mid-Term Actions (Medium
Severity)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade End-of-Life Operating Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and execute a detailed project plan to upgrade all
workstations currently running Windows 7 (and any other End-of-Life
operating systems) to a currently supported and patched operating system
(e.g., Windows 10/11).</p></li>
<li><p>Prioritize the upgrade of machines that handle sensitive data,
are exposed to external networks, or are used by high-privilege
users.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="general-best-practices">General Best Practices</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Regular Vulnerability Management Program:</strong>
Establish and maintain a continuous vulnerability management program
that includes regular internal and external vulnerability scans,
penetration testing, and timely remediation of identified
weaknesses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Robust Patch Management Program:</strong> Implement an
automated and systematic patch management program to ensure all
operating systems, applications, and network devices are consistently
kept up-to-date with the latest security patches and firmware
updates.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Principle of Least Privilege:</strong> Enforce the
principle of least privilege for all user accounts, service accounts,
and system processes, ensuring they are granted only the minimum
necessary permissions to perform their required functions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Network Segmentation:</strong> Consider implementing
network segmentation to logically divide the network into isolated
zones. This limits lateral movement for attackers and contains the
impact of potential breaches to specific segments.</p></li>
