<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of <strong>Infinity
Loop</strong> based on a review of organizational data, security
questionnaire responses, and recent network scan results. Our analysis
identifies key strengths in employee security awareness and acceptable
use policies. However, significant vulnerabilities exist, particularly
concerning the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and
sensitive data access, which represent critical gaps in access control.
The network scan confirmed that the previously identified risk of an
unencrypted web server on Port 80 is no longer active, as the port is
currently closed on the scanned target. Recommendations are provided to
address identified risks and enhance the overall security posture.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and improve the overall security
posture, the following recommendations are provided:</p>
<h2 id="identity-and-access-management">Identity and Access
Management</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Access:</strong> Mandate
Multi-Factor Authentication for all email accounts. This is a critical
control to prevent unauthorized access even if user credentials are
stolen. Solutions like Microsoft 365 MFA, Google Workspace MFA, or
third-party identity providers should be fully deployed and
enforced.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> Extend
MFA requirements to all systems that store, process, or transmit
sensitive organizational data. This adds an essential layer of security
to protect critical assets.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="network-security">Network Security</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Regular Network Scans:</strong> Conduct regular,
scheduled network vulnerability scans (both internal and external) to
continuously monitor for open ports, misconfigurations, and outdated
services. This will help confirm the mitigation status of previous risks
and identify new ones.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Service Hardening:</strong> Although Port 80 was found
closed, if any services are intentionally exposed in the future, ensure
they are hardened according to best practices, use encryption (e.g.,
HTTPS for web services), and are regularly patched.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ongoing-security-practices">Ongoing Security Practices</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Review and Update Risk Register:</strong> Regularly
review and update the organization’s risk register. Ensure that
previously identified risks, like the unencrypted web server, are
formally marked as mitigated based on verification, and new risks (e.g.,
from questionnaire gaps) are formally added and tracked.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Continuous Improvement:</strong> Establish a continuous
security improvement program that includes regular assessments, policy
reviews, and adaptation to new threats.</p></li>
