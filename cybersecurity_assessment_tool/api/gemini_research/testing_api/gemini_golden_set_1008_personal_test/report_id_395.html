<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of Verve &amp; Vigor,
combining insights from organizational security controls, network scan
results, and pre-existing risk data. Key findings indicate a mixed
security posture with several critical vulnerabilities and policy gaps.
While the organization currently employs Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) for email and sensitive data systems and conducts annual security
awareness training, significant weaknesses were identified. These
include the lack of MFA for computer login, the absence of a formal
acceptable use policy, and no dedicated security awareness training for
new employees. Furthermore, a critical pre-existing vulnerability,
‘Localhost Exposed‘ (CVSS 10.0), was confirmed, directly correlating
with an observed open SSH port (22) on the local host. Immediate
attention to these identified risks and policy deficiencies is crucial
to significantly enhance the overall security resilience of Verve &amp;
Vigor.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="key-gaps-identified-from-questionnaire">Key
Gaps Identified from Questionnaire:</h2>
<p>Based on the questionnaire responses, the following critical security
control gaps were identified:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Computer Login:</strong> The absence of
Multi-Factor Authentication for computer login significantly increases
the risk of unauthorized access to systems if user credentials are
compromised.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> Without
an AUP, employees lack clear guidelines regarding the proper and secure
use of organizational IT assets, potentially leading to misuse, data
breaches, or compliance violations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No New Employee Security Training:</strong> New hires are
not receiving immediate security awareness training, leaving them
vulnerable to common cyber threats and unaware of organizational
security protocols from the start of their employment.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed targeting the localhost,
<code>127.0.0.1</code>, to identify open ports and services. It is
important to note that the provided scan data was limited and did not
include detailed service names, product versions, or the exact scan
date. This limitation restricts the ability to perform a deep analysis
of specific software vulnerabilities.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Target:</strong> <code>127.0.0.1</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> N/A (Information not available in
provided scan data)</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="identified-open-ports">Identified Open Ports</h2>
<p>The scan identified the following open port:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port ID:</strong> 22</p></li>
<li><p><strong>State:</strong> Open</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Service/Product/Version:</strong> N/A (Information not
available in provided scan data)</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="technical-findings-analysis">Technical Findings Analysis</h2>
<p>Port 22 is commonly associated with SSH (Secure Shell), a protocol
used for secure remote access. While SSH is designed for secure
communication, its presence without detailed service and version
information prevents a thorough assessment of potential vulnerabilities
related to outdated software or insecure configurations. The state of
this port is particularly relevant when correlated with the existing
‘Localhost Exposed‘ risk. Ensuring SSH is configured securely (e.g.,
using key-based authentication, disabling root login, restricting
access, keeping software updated) is crucial.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and enhance the overall cybersecurity
posture of Verve &amp; Vigor, the following actionable recommendations
are provided, prioritized by severity.</p>
<h2 id="high-priority-recommendations">High Priority
Recommendations</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Login:</strong> Immediately
deploy and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication for all computer logins
across the organization. This should be a mandatory control for all
users to significantly reduce the risk of credential compromise leading
to unauthorized access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong>
Draft, communicate, and enforce a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use
Policy. This policy should clearly define expectations for employee
behavior regarding IT assets, data handling, and internet usage, and be
acknowledged by all employees.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish New Employee Security Awareness
Training:</strong> Implement mandatory and comprehensive security
awareness training for all new employees as part of their onboarding
process. This training should cover essential security best practices,
common threats (e.g., phishing, social engineering), and organizational
security protocols from day one.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Address ’Localhost Exposed’ Vulnerability:</strong>
Conduct an immediate and thorough investigation into the ’Localhost
Exposed’ vulnerability (CVSS 10.0). Determine the root cause of this
critical exposure and implement mitigation strategies. This may involve
closing unnecessary ports, hardening configurations, isolating affected
services, or implementing host-based firewalls.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="medium-priority-recommendations">Medium Priority
Recommendations</h2>
<ol start="5">
<li><p><strong>Secure SSH Configuration on Localhost (Port 22):</strong>
For the open SSH port (22) on , ensure it is securely configured. Key
steps include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Utilizing key-based authentication exclusively and disabling
password authentication.</p></li>
<li><p>Disabling direct root login.</p></li>
<li><p>Restricting access to specific IP addresses if external access is
absolutely required.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensuring the SSH server software is kept up-to-date with the
latest security patches.</p></li>
<li><p>If the service is not strictly necessary, consider disabling or
heavily restricting it.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Detailed Service Scanning:</strong> Perform more
in-depth network scans that actively probe for service banners, product
names, and version numbers. This will allow for a more precise
assessment of known software vulnerabilities and provide a clearer
picture of the attack surface.</p></li>
