<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p><strong>Midnight Oil Studios</strong> currently exhibits a
foundational security posture with several critical areas requiring
immediate attention and remediation. Key findings indicate significant
gaps in Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) implementation for email and
sensitive data systems, alongside a complete absence of structured
security awareness training programs for employees. Technical scans
identified an open SSH port on an internal system
(<code>127.0.0.1</code>), which directly correlates with a pre-existing
"Localhost Exposed" vulnerability rated with a critical CVSS score of
10.0. This combination represents an severe, immediate risk to the
organization. This report provides a detailed analysis of the current
cybersecurity state, outlines identified risks, and offers actionable
recommendations designed to significantly enhance the organization’s
defensive capabilities against prevalent cyber threats.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-questionnaire-results">Analysis
of Questionnaire Results</h2>
<p>The questionnaire results reveal several critical security gaps that
significantly increase the organization’s risk profile:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA Deficiencies:</strong> The absence of Multi-Factor
Authentication for both email access and sensitive data systems is a
severe vulnerability. These systems are prime targets for credential
theft, and without MFA, a compromised password can lead directly to
unauthorized access and data breaches.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Security Awareness Training Absence:</strong> A complete
lack of security awareness training, both for new hires and ongoing
annual training for all employees, is a major weakness. Employees
without proper training are more susceptible to social engineering
attacks, phishing, and human error, which are leading causes of
cybersecurity incidents.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Positive Controls:</strong> It is commendable that an
employee acceptable use policy is in place and MFA is utilized for
computer logins, providing some baseline security.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was conducted on the target system
<code>127.0.0.1</code>. The scan metadata provided did not include a
specific date, therefore the scan date is considered 2026-01-27 for the
purpose of this report.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target Host:</strong> <code>127.0.0.1</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> The host was reported as
<code>up</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Identified Open Ports:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 22/tcp (SSH):</strong> State is
<code>open</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Note:</em> The provided scan data did not include specific
service names, product details, or version information for the SSH
service running on port 22. This limitation restricts a detailed
assessment of potential software-specific vulnerabilities.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-technical-scan-results">Analysis
of Technical Scan Results</h2>
<p>The identification of an open SSH port (Port 22) on
<code>127.0.0.1</code> indicates an accessible service that presents an
attack surface. While SSH is a critical protocol for secure remote
administration, its exposure necessitates robust security measures.
Without specific version information, it is challenging to assess
vulnerabilities related to outdated software or known exploits. However,
the presence of any open port, particularly one often targeted by
attackers, warrants careful inspection and hardening, especially when
correlated with other critical risks.</p>

</div>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="detailed-risk-correlation">Detailed Risk
Correlation</h2>
<p>The most pressing concern arises from the direct correlation between
the pre-existing "Localhost Exposed" vulnerability, which is rated as
Critical (CVSS 10.0) and affects <code>127.0.0.1</code>, and the open
SSH port (port 22) discovered on the very same host. This indicates that
a system already identified with a maximum severity vulnerability is
also exposing a remote access service, creating an immediate and severe
exploitation pathway.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the widespread absence of MFA for critical assets such
as email and sensitive data systems, coupled with a complete lack of
security awareness training, dramatically increases the organization’s
susceptibility to initial compromise. An attacker could easily gain
initial access through common vectors like phishing or credential
stuffing, and without MFA, could then achieve deeper unauthorized access
or lateral movement within the network. These human-centric and access
control weaknesses collectively create an environment highly vulnerable
to advanced persistent threats and opportunistic attacks.</p>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To proactively address the identified risks and significantly enhance
the cybersecurity posture of <strong>Midnight Oil Studios</strong>, the
following recommendations are provided, categorized by priority:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Across
Critical Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>High Priority:</strong> Mandate MFA for all email
accounts, protecting against credential theft and phishing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>High Priority:</strong> Mandate MFA for all sensitive
data systems and applications to prevent unauthorized access to critical
information.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Comprehensive Security Awareness Training
Programs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>High Priority:</strong> Develop and implement mandatory
security awareness training for all new employees as part of their
onboarding process.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>High Priority:</strong> Implement annual mandatory
security awareness refresher training for all employees to continuously
educate them on evolving threats such as phishing, ransomware, and
social engineering tactics.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Immediately Address the “Localhost Exposed”
Vulnerability:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Critical Priority:</strong> Thoroughly investigate the
specific nature of the "Localhost Exposed" vulnerability on
<code>127.0.0.1</code>. Given its CVSS score of 10.0, apply all
necessary patches, configuration changes, or isolation measures with
extreme urgency to neutralize this critical threat.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Secure SSH Configuration on
<code>127.0.0.1</code>:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Medium Priority:</strong> Conduct a comprehensive audit
and hardening of the SSH service on <code>127.0.0.1</code>. Best
practices include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Disabling root login.</p></li>
<li><p>Enforcing strong, key-based authentication (and disabling
password authentication if feasible).</p></li>
<li><p>Restricting SSH access to a very limited set of known, trusted
source IP addresses.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensuring the SSH daemon is running the latest stable and patched
version.</p></li>
<li><p>Implementing robust logging and monitoring for all SSH login
attempts and activity.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Regular Vulnerability Management:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Establish and adhere to a schedule for regular vulnerability
scanning and penetration testing across all internal and external
systems to proactively identify and remediate emerging security
weaknesses.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Reinforce Patch Management:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ensure a robust and timely patch management policy is in place
for all operating systems, applications, and network devices to address
known vulnerabilities as soon as patches become available.</p></li>
</ul></li>
