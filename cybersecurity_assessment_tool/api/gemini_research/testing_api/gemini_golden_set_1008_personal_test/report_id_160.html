<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details a cybersecurity posture assessment for
<strong>Summit Peak Partners</strong>, integrating organizational data,
security control reviews, and technical scan results. The analysis
highlights several critical security gaps, predominantly in foundational
areas such as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access, the
absence of an Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), and a lack of
dedicated security awareness training for new employees. While a limited
internal network scan revealed no open ports on the target host
(<code>192.168.1.100</code>), these policy and procedural deficiencies
represent significant exploitable risks. Key recommendations include
immediate implementation of MFA for email, development and enforcement
of an AUP, and establishing mandatory security training for all new
hires to significantly bolster the organization’s defense against common
cyber threats.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed to assess the exposed services and
potential vulnerabilities of a targeted host.</p>
<h2 id="scan-details">Scan Details</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Used:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>192.168.1.100</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> N/A (not provided in input
data)</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: The target IP <code>192.168.1.100</code> is a private IP
address, indicating an internal scan against a specific host rather than
an external perimeter scan of the organization’s public-facing
assets.</em></p>
<h2 id="findings">Findings</h2>
<p>The Nmap scan indicated that the target host
(<code>192.168.1.100</code>) was <code>up</code>. However, no open ports
were detected, and all extra ports were reported as
<code>closed</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports:</strong> None found.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Services Identified:</strong> N/A (no open ports
detected).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Products/Versions:</strong> N/A (no open ports
detected).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This suggests a relatively secure network configuration for this
specific host at the network layer, implying that it is not exposing any
common services directly to the network from the perspective of the
scanner. It’s important to note that this scan does not assess
application-layer vulnerabilities or potential misconfigurations if the
host operates services on non-standard ports or if access is granted via
other means.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>

following risks have been identified.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and enhance the overall cybersecurity
posture of Summit Peak Partners, the following recommendations are
provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Access:</strong> Immediately
mandate and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all
organizational email accounts. This significantly reduces the risk of
unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a comprehensive Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) that
clearly outlines employee responsibilities and acceptable use of all
company-provided IT assets, systems, and data. Ensure all employees
acknowledge, understand, and adhere to this policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mandate Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong> Establish a mandatory security awareness training
program for all new hires, to be completed as part of their onboarding
process. This ensures foundational security knowledge is imparted from
day one.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enhance Annual Security Awareness Training:</strong>
While annual training is conducted, consider expanding its scope to
regularly cover emerging threats, recent phishing examples, and specific
organizational policies. Regular reinforcement helps keep security
top-of-mind.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Comprehensive Internal Vulnerability
Scans:</strong> Given that <code>192.168.1.100</code> is an internal IP,
it is strongly recommended to perform regular, authenticated internal
vulnerability scans across all network assets. This will identify
application-layer weaknesses, misconfigurations, and other potential
vulnerabilities beyond basic network port scanning.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Policy Review and Update:</strong> Establish a
schedule for regular review and updates of all security policies,
including the AUP and training materials, at least annually or whenever
there are significant changes in the threat landscape, technology, or
organizational structure.</p></li>
