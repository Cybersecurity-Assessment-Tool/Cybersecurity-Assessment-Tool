<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">1. Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for <strong></strong>, derived from a network scan, an organizational
security questionnaire, and a review of existing risk data.</p>
<p>The technical analysis of the external network scan targeting
revealed a positive finding: <strong>no open ports were
detected</strong>. This suggests a tightly controlled network perimeter,
likely protected by an effective firewall or due to a system
configuration that minimizes exposed services. This significantly
reduces the immediate external attack surface.</p>
<p>However, the organizational security questionnaire highlighted
critical policy-level vulnerabilities. Specifically, the absence of an
employee acceptable use policy and a lack of mandatory annual security
awareness training for all employees represent significant human-factor
risks. These gaps can lead to increased exposure to social engineering,
data breaches through misuse, and overall non-compliance, undermining an
otherwise strong technical perimeter.</p>
<p>Recommendations are provided to address these identified
organizational risks, focusing on implementing robust policies and
continuous employee education to fortify the human element of
security.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-security-controls">Analysis of
Security Controls</h2>
<p>demonstrates a commendable commitment to implementing Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) across critical access points. This is a strong
security measure that significantly mitigates risks associated with
compromised credentials for email, computer logins, and sensitive data
access.</p>
<p>However, the review identified two critical areas requiring immediate
attention:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Absence of an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> The lack of a formal AUP leaves the organization
vulnerable. Without clear guidelines, employees may inadvertently or
intentionally misuse IT resources, handle sensitive data improperly, or
engage in activities that expose the organization to legal,
reputational, or security risks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inadequate Annual Security Awareness Training:</strong>
While new employees receive initial training, the absence of ongoing,
annual security awareness training for all staff creates a significant
gap. Cyber threats constantly evolve, and without regular updates and
reinforcement, employees are more susceptible to sophisticated social
engineering attacks, phishing campaigns, and malware, which remain
primary vectors for security breaches.</p></li>

</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="open-ports-and-services">Open Ports and
Services</h2>
<p>The network scan performed on reported <strong>no open
ports</strong>. This finding indicates that either the target system has
no network services listening on commonly scanned ports, or that an
active firewall is effectively filtering or blocking all incoming
connection attempts. From an external perspective, this represents a
strong security posture, as there are no immediately identifiable entry
points for remote attackers through exposed services.</p>

cybersecurity posture, the following recommendations are provided,
prioritized by severity.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="high-priority-recommendations">High Priority
Recommendations</h2>
<p>These recommendations directly address the critical policy and
training gaps identified.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement a Comprehensive Employee Acceptable
Use Policy (AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create a clear, concise, and comprehensive AUP document. This
policy should cover responsible use of company-owned devices, network
resources, internet usage, email, social media, software installation,
and sensitive data handling.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct mandatory review and acknowledgement sessions for all
employees (new and existing) to ensure understanding and
compliance.</p></li>
<li><p>Integrate the AUP into HR policies and new employee onboarding
processes.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish and Enforce Mandatory Annual Security Awareness
Training for All Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement a recurring security awareness training program for all
employees, at least once per year.</p></li>
<li><p>Training content should be up-to-date, interactive, and cover
topics such as phishing, ransomware, social engineering, secure password
practices, data protection, and incident reporting procedures.</p></li>
<li><p>Track employee completion rates and consider supplementary
awareness campaigns (e.g., simulated phishing exercises) to reinforce
learning.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="general-recommendations-for-continuous-improvement">General
Recommendations for Continuous Improvement</h2>
<p>These recommendations are good practices for maintaining a strong
security posture, even if not directly linked to a specific
vulnerability identified in this assessment.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Regular Vulnerability Management:</strong> While no open
ports were found, continue regular vulnerability scanning of all
internal and external assets. Consider periodic penetration testing to
identify subtle weaknesses that automated scans might miss.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Test an Incident Response Plan
(IRP):</strong> Ensure there is a well-documented and regularly tested
Incident Response Plan in place to effectively detect, contain,
eradicate, and recover from security incidents.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Asset Inventory and Management:</strong> Maintain an
accurate and up-to-date inventory of all hardware and software assets.
This ensures that all components are accounted for in security planning,
patching, and monitoring.</p></li>
