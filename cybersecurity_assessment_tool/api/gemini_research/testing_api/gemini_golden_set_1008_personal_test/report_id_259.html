<p>This report details the security posture assessment for Firebrand
Media, conducted on 2026-01-26. The assessment involved a review of
organizational security controls, an external network scan, and an
analysis of identified risks.</p>
<p>Overall, Firebrand Media demonstrates a commendable commitment to
multi-factor authentication (MFA) across critical systems and has an
acceptable use policy in place. However, critical gaps were identified
in security awareness training for both new and existing employees,
representing a significant human-element vulnerability. A network scan
revealed an open SSH port, for which further investigation is
recommended due to a lack of version information. While no pre-existing
vulnerabilities were reported, the identified gaps introduce
considerable risk that requires immediate attention. Addressing these
areas is crucial for enhancing the organization’s defense against modern
cyber threats.</p>

<h2 id="key-findings-from-control-review">Key Findings from Control
Review</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Firebrand Media has successfully
implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer
logins, and sensitive data systems. An acceptable use policy is also in
place, indicating foundational policy controls are established.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gaps:</strong> There are significant deficiencies in
security awareness training. Specifically, new employees do not receive
security training upon onboarding, and existing employees do not undergo
annual training. This leaves the organization highly vulnerable to
human-centric attacks such as phishing, social engineering, and the
exploitation of common user errors, as employees may lack the knowledge
to identify and respond to threats.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed using Nmap. The target of the
scan was identified as .</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> No specific scan date was provided in
the input data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Used:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> Up</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="open-ports-and-services">Open Ports and Services</h2>
<p>The following open ports and services were identified on the target
host:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 22 (TCP):</strong> Open</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Service:</strong> SSH (Secure Shell)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Product/Version:</strong> Not identified by the provided
scan output.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="technical-scan-analysis">Technical Scan Analysis</h2>
<p>The presence of an open SSH port (22) is common for remote
administration. However, without product and version information, it is
not possible to assess if the running SSH service is outdated or
contains known vulnerabilities. Open SSH ports are frequently targeted
by automated brute-force attacks and exploit attempts, making proper
configuration, timely patching, and restrictive access controls
essential. The lack of version information presents an information gap
that requires further investigation.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of organizational controls, technical scan
results, and pre-existing risk data, the following risks have been
identified:</p>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Inadequate New Employee Security Awareness
Training</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">New employees are not receiving security
awareness training. This significantly increases the risk of social
engineering attacks, phishing, and basic security protocol violations
from the outset of their employment.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of Regular Employee Security
Awareness Training</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">All employees do not receive security
awareness training at least once per year. This leads to a degradation
of security knowledge, makes employees susceptible to evolving threats,
and reduces overall human firewall effectiveness.</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">High</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Open SSH Port without Version
Information</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">An SSH port (22) was found open on the
target host. While SSH is a common and secure protocol, the scan did not
provide version information, which prevents an assessment for known
vulnerabilities in specific SSH implementations. This is an information
gap requiring further investigation to ensure the service is
secure.</td>

<h2 id="pre-existing-vulnerabilities">Pre-existing Vulnerabilities</h2>
<p>No pre-existing vulnerabilities were reported in the provided data,
indicating a clean slate regarding previously documented risks, though
new risks have been identified by this assessment.</p>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and enhance Firebrand Media’s
overall security posture, the following actionable recommendations are
provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Mandatory New Employee Security Awareness
Training:</strong> Develop and implement a comprehensive security
awareness training program for all new employees. This training should
be mandatory and completed before new hires gain access to company
systems and data. Content should include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Phishing and social engineering recognition.</p></li>
<li><p>Password best practices and MFA usage.</p></li>
<li><p>Acceptable Use Policy review.</p></li>
<li><p>Data handling and classification guidelines.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Annual Employee Security Awareness Training
Program:</strong> Institute a mandatory annual (or more frequent)
security awareness training program for all existing employees. This
recurring training should:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Reinforce core security principles.</p></li>
<li><p>Educate on current and emerging threat vectors (e.g., ransomware,
supply chain attacks).</p></li>
<li><p>Provide refresher on organizational policies and incident
reporting procedures.</p></li>
<li><p>Utilize engaging formats (e.g., interactive modules, simulated
phishing campaigns).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Verify and Secure SSH Service on :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Conduct an authenticated scan or manual verification on the host
at to identify the exact version of the SSH service running.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure the SSH server is running a current, supported, and
securely configured version. Apply all relevant security patches
promptly.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement strong SSH security practices, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Disable root login via SSH.</p></li>
<li><p>Enforce key-based authentication exclusively, disabling password
authentication.</p></li>
<li><p>Configure strong ciphers, Message Authentication Codes (MACs),
and Key Exchange algorithms.</p></li>
<li><p>Limit SSH access to only necessary administrative IP addresses or
subnets via firewall rules.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement a robust logging and monitoring solution for SSH access
attempts.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Firebrand Media has a solid foundation regarding MFA implementation
across critical access points. However, the identified critical gaps in
security awareness training pose a significant and immediate risk to the
organization, as the human element remains a primary target for
attackers. Additionally, the open SSH service requires immediate
attention to ensure it is securely configured and patched. Addressing
these training deficiencies and thoroughly securing the identified open
SSH service will substantially improve the organization’s defensive
capabilities against a wide range of cyber threats. Proactive engagement
with these recommendations is crucial for maintaining a robust and
resilient security posture.</p>
