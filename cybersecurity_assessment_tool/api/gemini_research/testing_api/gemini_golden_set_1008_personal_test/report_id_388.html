<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">1. Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for <strong>Midnight Oil Studios</strong>, based on a review of
organizational security controls, a targeted network scan, and an
analysis of reported risks.</p>
<p>The organization demonstrates good practice in implementing
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across email, computer logins, and
sensitive data systems, as well as providing initial security awareness
training for new employees. These foundational controls are critical for
protecting access and increasing initial awareness.</p>
<p>However, two significant organizational gaps were identified: the
absence of a formal employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and the lack of
mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees. These
gaps represent high risks that could lead to misuse of company assets,
data breaches, and a decline in overall security posture over time.</p>
<p>A targeted network scan on the internal host revealed no open ports,
suggesting a relatively well-secured perimeter for the scanned device at
the time of assessment. No pre-existing vulnerabilities were reported in
the provided data.</p>
<p>The recommendations section outlines actionable steps to mitigate the
identified organizational risks and further strengthen the
organization’s cybersecurity defenses.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">4. Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed using <code>nmap</code> on the target
host.</p>

Unavailable]</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="open-ports-and-services">4.1. Open Ports and
Services</h2>
<p>The scan indicated that no open ports were found on the target host .
This suggests that the device is either not publicly accessible on
common ports or is well-hardened against external scanning for typical
services. <em>(Note: Specific services, versions, or potential CVEs
cannot be detailed as no open ports were identified during this targeted
scan.)</em></p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">6. Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and enhance the overall cybersecurity
posture, the following actionable recommendations are provided:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement a Comprehensive Acceptable Use
Policy (AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create a detailed AUP that clearly defines employee
responsibilities regarding the use of company IT resources, data
handling, internet usage, and communication.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all employees, including new hires, review and formally
acknowledge their understanding and acceptance of the AUP. This should
be a mandatory annual process.</p></li>
<li><p>Integrate the AUP into HR policies and disciplinary
frameworks.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Mandatory Annual Security Awareness Training
for All Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement a recurring, mandatory annual security awareness
training program for all employees, not limited to just new
hires.</p></li>
<li><p>The training content should be updated regularly to cover the
latest threats (e.g., sophisticated phishing techniques, ransomware,
supply chain attacks) and reinforce best practices for data protection,
password hygiene, and suspicious activity reporting.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider conducting simulated phishing exercises periodically to
assess and improve employee vigilance and identify areas for further
training.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Maintain and Verify Strong Technical
Controls:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Continue the robust practice of limiting exposed services and
ensuring strong firewall configurations, as indicated by the current
network scan results for the target host.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement an asset inventory system to track all
network-connected devices.</p></li>
<li><p>Regularly review network configurations, firewall rules, and
conduct periodic vulnerability scans across the entire internal network
to ensure no unintended services become exposed or vulnerabilities
arise.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement a Regular Security Posture Review
Process:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Establish a schedule for regular internal reviews of all security
policies, procedures, and technical controls.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider engaging independent third-party experts for annual
penetration testing and advanced security assessments to identify blind
spots and continuously improve defenses.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">7. Conclusion</h1>
<p><strong>Midnight Oil Studios</strong> has a commendable foundation in
cybersecurity, notably with strong MFA implementation and initial
employee training. However, the identified critical gaps concerning a
formal Acceptable Use Policy and recurring annual security awareness
training present significant organizational risks that, if left
unaddressed, could substantially compromise data integrity, operational
continuity, and compliance. By proactively implementing the recommended
actions, <strong>Midnight Oil Studios</strong> can significantly mature
its overall cybersecurity posture, reduce its attack surface, and foster
a more secure operational environment.</p>
