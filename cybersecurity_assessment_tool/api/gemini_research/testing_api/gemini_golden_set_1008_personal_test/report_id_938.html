<h1 id="executive-summary">1. Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for Midnight Oil Studios, derived from a combination of organizational
data, network scan results, and an analysis of pre-existing risks. The
assessment reveals several critical vulnerabilities and significant
control gaps that require immediate attention.</p>
<p>Key findings include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Critical Network Vulnerabilities:</strong> An outdated
FTP service (vsftpd 2.3.4) with known remote code execution
vulnerabilities was identified, alongside enabled anonymous FTP login,
posing an extreme risk of unauthorized access and system compromise on
target <code>10.0.0.15</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Significant Control Gaps:</strong> The organization lacks
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and sensitive data
systems, leaving these crucial assets vulnerable to credential-based
attacks. Furthermore, the absence of an employee acceptable use policy
and security awareness training for new employees creates a weak
security culture foundation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Outdated Systems:</strong> An existing risk highlights
the presence of outdated Windows 7 workstations, which are no longer
supported by Microsoft and expose the organization to unpatched
vulnerabilities.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, Midnight Oil Studios exhibits a high-risk cybersecurity
posture. Urgent action is recommended to remediate the identified
critical vulnerabilities and implement foundational security controls to
mitigate potential breaches and ensure business continuity.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-control-gaps">Analysis of Control
Gaps:</h2>
<p>The absence of MFA for email and sensitive data systems represents a
significant weakness, as these are primary targets for attackers. The
lack of an acceptable use policy and initial security awareness training
for new employees indicates a gap in establishing a strong security
culture from the outset.</p>

</div>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="technical-findings-analysis">Technical
Findings Analysis:</h2>
<p>The presence of an FTP service running <code>vsftpd 2.3.4</code> on
port 21 is a critical security vulnerability. This version of
<code>vsftpd</code> was released in 2011 and is known to have several
serious vulnerabilities, most notably CVE-2011-2523, a backdoor remote
code execution vulnerability. Exploiting such a vulnerability could
allow an attacker to gain full control over the affected system.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the scan script identified that <strong>anonymous FTP
login is allowed</strong>. This configuration permits any
unauthenticated user to connect to the FTP server, potentially access,
upload, or modify files, depending on the server’s configuration. This
combination of an outdated, critically vulnerable service with anonymous
access enabled constitutes an extremely high risk for system compromise,
data breach, and potential unauthorized code execution.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">6. Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following recommendations are provided to address the identified
risks and improve Midnight Oil Studios’ overall cybersecurity posture.
Prioritization is given to critical and high-severity findings.</p>
<h2 id="immediate-critical-action-items">6.1. Immediate Critical Action
Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Disable Anonymous FTP Access:</strong> Immediately
disable anonymous login functionality on the FTP server at
<code>10.0.0.15</code>. This is a critical vulnerability that allows
unauthenticated access and must be remediated without delay.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade or Decommission FTP Service:</strong> Urgently
upgrade <code>vsftpd</code> to a current, supported version, or
decommission the service entirely if it is not essential for business
operations. If an immediate upgrade is not feasible, isolate the server
from the network or implement strict firewall rules to restrict access
to trusted internal IP addresses only.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="high-priority-control-implementations">6.2. High-Priority
Control Implementations</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Access:</strong> Deploy and
enforce Multi-Factor Authentication for all user accounts accessing
corporate email. This significantly reduces the risk of credential
compromise through phishing and brute-force attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> Extend
MFA enforcement to all systems and applications containing sensitive
organizational data. This includes databases, file shares, and critical
business applications.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="medium-priority-security-enhancements">6.3. Medium-Priority
Security Enhancements</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a comprehensive AUP that outlines acceptable use
of company IT assets, data, and internet resources. Ensure all employees
read, understand, and formally acknowledge this policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Initiate Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong> Implement mandatory security awareness training as
part of the onboarding process for all new hires. This training should
cover common threats, company policies, and best practices for secure
behavior.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade Outdated Windows Workstations:</strong> Plan and
execute an upgrade path for all Windows 7 workstations to a currently
supported operating system (e.g., Windows 10 or 11). Prioritize systems
with access to sensitive data or internet exposure. If immediate upgrade
is not possible, ensure these systems are isolated from the main network
and critical data is not processed or stored on them.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="general-security-best-practices">6.4. General Security Best
Practices</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Regular Patch Management:</strong> Establish a robust and
automated patch management program for all operating systems,
applications, and network devices to ensure timely application of
security updates.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Vulnerability Scanning:</strong> Conduct regular
vulnerability scans and periodic penetration tests across the entire IT
infrastructure to proactively identify and address emerging
weaknesses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Security Logging and Monitoring:</strong> Implement
centralized logging and monitoring solutions to collect, analyze, and
alert on security-related events, enabling timely detection and response
to suspicious activities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Incident Response Plan:</strong> Develop and regularly
test a comprehensive incident response plan to ensure the organization
can effectively prepare for, detect, contain, eradicate, recover from,
and learn from security incidents.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These recommendations, once implemented, will significantly enhance
Midnight Oil Studios’ cybersecurity posture and reduce its overall risk
exposure.</p>
