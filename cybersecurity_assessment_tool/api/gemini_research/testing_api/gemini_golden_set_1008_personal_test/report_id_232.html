<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a cybersecurity posture assessment for
<strong>Granite Shield</strong>, based on a review of provided
organizational data, a security questionnaire, and a targeted network
scan of <code>192.168.1.100</code>.</p>
<p>The analysis reveals several critical gaps in foundational security
controls. Notably, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for
email access or computer logins, and the organization lacks a formal
Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). Furthermore, new employees do not receive
essential security awareness training. These deficiencies represent
significant internal risks and potential compliance challenges.</p>
<p>From a technical standpoint, the network scan of
<code>192.168.1.100</code> did not identify any open ports or directly
exposed services. While this specific finding indicates a minimal
external attack surface for this host, it does not provide a
comprehensive view of the entire network’s external exposure or internal
vulnerabilities. No pre-existing vulnerabilities were reported in the
provided data.</p>
<p>In summary, <strong>Granite Shield</strong>’s security posture
demonstrates weaknesses in fundamental policy and access controls that
require immediate attention. Addressing these areas is crucial for
mitigating significant cybersecurity risks.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was conducted using Nmap, targeting the IP address
<code>192.168.1.100</code>. The objective was to identify open ports and
services that could represent an external attack surface.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Target:</strong> <code>192.168.1.100</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> <em>Not provided in input
data.</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Used:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> Up</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports Detected:</strong> None. The scan indicated
that no open ports were found on the target host
<code>192.168.1.100</code>. All extra ports were reported as
closed.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Analysis:</em> The finding of no open ports on the scanned target
<code>192.168.1.100</code> suggests a minimal direct network-level
attack surface from an external perspective for this specific host. This
is a positive indicator for the host’s direct exposure. However, this
finding should be interpreted cautiously as it does not provide a
comprehensive assessment of the entire organizational network, nor does
it address potential vulnerabilities at the application layer, internal
network weaknesses, or risks on other hosts within the environment.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes findings from the security control review,
technical scan results, and any reported existing vulnerabilities to
identify and categorize current cybersecurity risks.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align: left;"><strong>Risk Name</strong></th>
<th style="text-align: left;"><strong>Overview</strong></th>
<th style="text-align: left;"><strong>Severity</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of MFA for Email Access</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The absence of Multi-Factor Authentication
for email access significantly elevates the risk of account compromise
via phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force attacks, potentially
leading to business email compromise (BEC) or data exfiltration.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">High</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of MFA for Computer Login</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Without MFA for computer logins, a
compromised user credential (e.g., through malware or social
engineering) grants an attacker direct access to internal systems,
facilitating lateral movement and broader system compromise.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">High</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Absence of Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP)</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The lack of a formal Acceptable Use Policy
leaves employees without clear guidelines regarding the appropriate and
secure use of company IT resources. This can lead to increased incidents
of misuse, data leakage, and potential non-compliance with regulatory
requirements.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Medium</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">No Security Awareness Training for New
Employees</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">New employees, unfamiliar with
organizational security practices and common threats, are particularly
vulnerable targets for social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing). The
absence of initial training significantly increases the human element
risk from day one.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Medium</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">No Reported Existing Vulnerabilities</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Based on the provided input data, no
pre-existing vulnerabilities were identified or reported by the
organization. This reduces the immediate known risk from this category
but does not preclude unknown vulnerabilities.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Low</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Minimal External Attack Surface on Scanned
Host</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The network scan of the specified host
(<code>192.168.1.100</code>) revealed no open ports, suggesting a
reduced direct external attack surface for this individual asset. This
is a positive technical finding, assuming proper firewalling.</td>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the comprehensive assessment, the following recommendations
are provided to enhance <strong>Granite Shield</strong>’s cybersecurity
posture and mitigate identified risks:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Across All
Critical Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> Immediate.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Mandate and deploy MFA for all email
access and for all computer logins across the organization. Prioritize
administrative accounts and sensitive systems. This is the single most
effective control against credential theft.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce a Comprehensive Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> High.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Create a clear, concise, and legally
reviewed AUP that outlines employee responsibilities for using company
IT assets. Implement a mandatory sign-off process for all employees, new
and existing.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Mandatory Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> High.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Integrate a comprehensive cybersecurity
awareness training module into the onboarding process for all new hires.
This training should cover topics such as phishing, social engineering,
password hygiene, and company policies.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Broader Vulnerability Assessments and Penetration
Testing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> Medium.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Expand network scanning and
vulnerability assessments to encompass all internal network segments,
critical servers, and other external-facing assets. Consider engaging in
regular penetration testing to simulate real-world attacks.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Regularly Review and Update Security Policies and
Procedures:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> Ongoing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Establish a recurring schedule (e.g.,
annually) for reviewing and updating all security policies, including
the AUP and security awareness training content, to ensure they remain
current with evolving threats and technologies.</p></li>
</ul></li>
