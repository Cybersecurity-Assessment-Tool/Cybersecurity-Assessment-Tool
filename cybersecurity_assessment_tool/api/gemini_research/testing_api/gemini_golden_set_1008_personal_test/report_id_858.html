<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report presents a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for Hidden Gem, derived from an analysis of organizational data, a
recent network scan, and existing risk information. The assessment
reveals a nuanced security landscape characterized by foundational
policy strengths but also significant operational and technical
vulnerabilities. Key findings include a concerning lack of Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) across crucial access vectors and a gap in security
awareness training for new employees. While a limited network scan of a
specified internal target indicated no open ports, a conflict was
identified with an existing risk stating an "Unencrypted Web Server"
with an open Port 80. Strategic recommendations are provided to mitigate
these risks, prioritizing the implementation of MFA and enhanced
training programs, to significantly bolster the organization’s defense
capabilities.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-security-control-review">Analysis
of Security Control Review</h2>
<p>The questionnaire responses indicate a critical deficiency in the
deployment of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). The absence of MFA for
email access, computer logins, and sensitive data systems represents a
severe vulnerability, making the organization highly susceptible to
credential stuffing, phishing, and other forms of unauthorized access.
Another significant gap is the lack of dedicated security awareness
training for new employees, which leaves new hires ill-equipped to
recognize and respond to cyber threats during their initial employment
period. Positively, Hidden Gem has an acceptable use policy in place and
conducts annual security awareness training for all employees,
demonstrating a commitment to policy and ongoing education for existing
staff.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on a specific internal target. The
metadata and findings are detailed below.</p>
<h2 id="scan-metadata">Scan Metadata</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>192.168.0.5</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Used:</strong> nmap</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not provided in source data.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="scan-findings">Scan Findings</h2>
<p>The scan of <code>192.168.0.5</code> identified the host as
<strong>up</strong>. However, for the specific port checked (Port 80),
the state was reported as <strong>closed</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 80:</strong> Closed. No services, products, or
versions were identified as running on this port.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overall:</strong> This scan did not identify any open ports
on the target <code>192.168.0.5</code>. This finding, while positive for
the scanned port, suggests that the target’s direct network exposure for
the specified port is minimal or well-controlled. It is important to
acknowledge that this was a limited scan, and a more comprehensive scan
of additional ports and network segments would provide a fuller
picture.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="note-on-discrepancy-with-existing-risks">Note
on Discrepancy with Existing Risks</h2>
<p>It is crucial to highlight a discrepancy between this technical scan
finding and an existing vulnerability record. Input 3 contains an
existing risk titled "Unencrypted Web Server" with the overview "Port 80
is open." However, the recent network scan of <code>192.168.0.5</code>
found port 80 to be <strong>closed</strong>. This directly contradicts
the premise of this specific existing risk for the scanned target. This
suggests that the existing risk may be outdated, refer to a different
system within the organization, or require re-validation and update
based on current infrastructure configuration.</p>

<p><em>Note 1: This existing risk states "Port 80 is open." However, the
recent network scan of <code>192.168.0.5</code> found port 80 to be
closed. This suggests the risk may be outdated, apply to a different
system, or require re-validation.</em></p>
</div>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and enhance Hidden Gem’s overall
cybersecurity posture, the following actionable recommendations are
provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Across All
Critical Systems (High Priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Deploy MFA for all user accounts accessing email, irrespective of
location, to significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access due to
compromised credentials.</p></li>
<li><p>Enforce MFA for all user logins to company computers, network
resources, and VPNs to secure workstation and network access.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement MFA for all sensitive data systems and applications to
protect critical information assets from unauthorized access.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Mandatory Security Awareness Training for New
Employees (High Priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and integrate a comprehensive cybersecurity awareness
training module into the onboarding process for all new hires. This
training should cover topics such as phishing, social engineering,
password hygiene, safe browsing, and data handling policies.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Review and Validate Existing Risk Register (Medium
Priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Conduct an immediate review of the "Unencrypted Web Server" risk
(R5) to determine its current applicability. Verify if Port 80 is indeed
closed on all relevant production systems. Update or retire the risk if
it is no longer valid or if the service has been moved to HTTPS. Extend
this review to all entries in the existing risk register to ensure
accuracy and relevance.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Comprehensive Network Scans (Medium
Priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Expand network scanning efforts beyond single targets and
specific ports to gain a more complete and accurate inventory of all
network-facing assets. This includes regular scans of external
perimeter, internal network segments, and cloud environments for open
ports, vulnerable services, and misconfigurations.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Regularly Review and Update Policies and Training (Low
Priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>While an acceptable use policy and annual training are in place,
ensure these documents and materials are reviewed at least annually and
updated to reflect the latest threat landscape, technological changes,
and organizational best practices.</p></li>
</ul></li>
