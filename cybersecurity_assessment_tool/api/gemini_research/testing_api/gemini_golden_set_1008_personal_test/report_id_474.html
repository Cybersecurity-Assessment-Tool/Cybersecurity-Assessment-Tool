<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report presents a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for <strong>Vertex Solutions</strong>, derived from the analysis and
correlation of a recent network scan, a detailed organizational security
questionnaire, and the organization’s existing risk register.</p>
<p>The assessment identifies several critical vulnerabilities and
significant control gaps. Notably, the organization lacks Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for email access, posing a severe risk of account
compromise. Furthermore, there is an absence of consistent security
awareness training for both new and existing employees, significantly
increasing the human element risk from social engineering and phishing
attacks.</p>
<p>Technically, the network scan on revealed no open ports, which is a
positive indicator for the perimeter’s immediate security. However, this
finding contradicts an existing risk register entry for an "Unencrypted
Web Server" on Port 80, highlighting a need for risk register
reconciliation. Addressing the identified control deficiencies and
ensuring the accuracy of risk documentation are paramount for elevating
Vertex Solutions’ overall security resilience.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the comprehensive analysis, the following actionable
recommendations are provided to address identified risks and enhance
Vertex Solutions’ overall cybersecurity posture:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Mandate and Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
for Email Access:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediately deploy and enforce MFA for
all organizational email accounts. This is the single most impactful
step to mitigate the risk of email account compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Guidance:</strong> Provide clear instructions, training,
and support to all employees during the rollout phase to ensure smooth
adoption.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish and Maintain a Robust Security Awareness
Training Program:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop and integrate mandatory security
awareness training for all new employees as part of their onboarding
process.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Implement annual mandatory refresher
training for all employees, covering current threat landscapes, phishing
recognition, secure browsing, and incident reporting
procedures.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Consideration:</strong> Implement regular phishing
simulation exercises to test and reinforce employee vigilance in a
controlled environment.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Reconcile and Validate Risk Register
Entries:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Conduct an immediate review of the
"Unencrypted Web Server" risk in the risk register.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Investigation:</strong> Verify if Port 80 was indeed
remediated and closed on the target , or if the risk pertains to another
system not covered by this scan.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Update:</strong> Update the risk register to accurately
reflect the current state of assets and associated risks, marking
remediated risks as closed or providing clarification for
discrepancies.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Regular Vulnerability Scanning and Penetration
Testing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Establish a recurring schedule for
internal and external network vulnerability scans to proactively
identify and address security weaknesses before they can be
exploited.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Consider periodic penetration tests to
simulate real-world attacks and assess the effectiveness of existing
security controls and incident response capabilities.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Review and Update Security Policies
Periodically:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Conduct annual reviews of all security
policies, including the Acceptable Use Policy, to ensure they remain
current, relevant, and enforceable given changes in technology, threats,
and organizational structure.</p></li>
