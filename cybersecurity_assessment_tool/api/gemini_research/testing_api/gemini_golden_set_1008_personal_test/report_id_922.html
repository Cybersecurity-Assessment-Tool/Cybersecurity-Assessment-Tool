<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for <strong>Iron Oak Furniture</strong> based on an organizational
security questionnaire, technical network scan data, and a review of
pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The assessment highlights several critical security gaps primarily
identified through the organizational questionnaire. Key findings
include the complete absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across
email access, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, which
represents a significant vulnerability to credential-based attacks.
Furthermore, the organization lacks formal security awareness training
for new employees and does not conduct annual training for all staff,
leaving the workforce susceptible to social engineering and phishing
attempts.</p>
<p>No technical network scan findings (open ports, services) were
identified from the provided data, indicating either a clean external
posture at the time of the scan or that the scan results were empty.
Similarly, no pre-existing vulnerabilities were provided for review.
Therefore, this report focuses on addressing the foundational policy and
control gaps.</p>
<p>Immediate recommendations include the urgent implementation of MFA
across all relevant systems and the establishment of robust, recurring
security awareness training programs. Addressing these fundamental
controls will significantly enhance the organization’s security posture
against common attack vectors.</p>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This report synthesizes data from three primary sources to provide a
holistic view of the current cybersecurity landscape for the client
organization:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Network Scan Data (Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON):</strong>
Provides insights into publicly exposed services and potential
vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Organizational Security Questionnaire
(Input_2_Org_Data_JSON):</strong> Assesses the implementation of key
security policies and controls.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Current Risk Register
(Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON):</strong> Details pre-existing and
identified vulnerabilities within the organization.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The objective is to identify security gaps, assess their potential
impact, and provide actionable recommendations to enhance the overall
security posture.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>The network scan targeted <code>[Target IP]</code>. No open ports or
services were identified from the provided network scan data. This
indicates that either no services were exposed externally at the time of
the scan, or the scan results provided were empty. Without active scan
data, a detailed technical vulnerability assessment cannot be performed
at this layer.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the security control review, several high-priority risks
have been identified due to the lack of essential security controls. No
technical scan-based risks or pre-existing risks were provided in the

awareness training program for all employees. This training should be
updated regularly to reflect current threat landscapes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Keeps all employees informed about
evolving threats (e.g., new phishing techniques, social engineering
tactics) and reinforces secure behaviors, fostering a security-conscious
culture.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The assessment of <strong>Iron Oak Furniture</strong>’s cybersecurity
posture reveals significant gaps in fundamental security controls,
particularly concerning Multi-Factor Authentication and employee
security awareness training. While no active technical vulnerabilities
were identified from the provided (empty) scan data, the policy and
training deficiencies present a high risk to the organization.</p>
<p>Addressing the recommendations outlined in this report, especially
the immediate implementation of MFA across critical access points and
the establishment of comprehensive, recurring security awareness
training, will substantially mitigate the identified risks and improve
the overall resilience against common cyber threats. Continuous
monitoring and regular reassessment of security controls are crucial for
maintaining a strong security posture in an evolving threat
landscape.</p>
