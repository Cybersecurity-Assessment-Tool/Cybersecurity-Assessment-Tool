<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment for Aeon Pharmaceuticals, conducted on <strong>November 22,
2025</strong>. The assessment involved a review of organizational
security controls via questionnaire, analysis of a network scan, and
correlation with any pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The overall cybersecurity posture of Aeon Pharmaceuticals is assessed
as <strong>Weak</strong>, primarily due to several critical gaps in
security policies and a significant technical vulnerability identified
on a public-facing service. Key findings include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Outdated Web Server:</strong> The public-facing web
server on <code>192.168.10.5</code> (port 443) is running Nginx 1.18.0,
which has reached End-of-Life (EOL) in 2021 and is highly vulnerable to
known exploits.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>SSL Certificate Mismatch:</strong> The SSL certificate
for <code>192.168.10.5</code> is issued to
<code>www.acme-corp.com</code>, not
<code>AeonPharmaceuticals.org</code>, indicating a potential
misconfiguration or security concern.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>MFA Gap:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is
not required for access to sensitive data systems, leaving critical
assets exposed to credential-based attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Policy Deficiencies:</strong> The organization lacks an
Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and does not conduct regular or new-employee
security awareness training, creating significant human factor
risks.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Immediate action is required to address these critical
vulnerabilities and policy gaps to enhance the organization’s resilience
against cyber threats.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-security-control-gaps">Analysis
of Security Control Gaps:</h2>
<p>The ’No’ responses indicate critical policy and procedural
deficiencies that significantly elevate risk:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> Lack of MFA on
systems containing sensitive data is a severe vulnerability, allowing a
single compromised credential to grant unauthorized access to critical
organizational information.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> Absence of an AUP
means employees may not be aware of their responsibilities regarding IT
asset usage, leading to misuse, data breaches, or compliance
violations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Security Awareness Training (SAT):</strong> The complete
lack of both new-employee and annual SAT leaves the organization highly
susceptible to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting)
and general human error, which are leading causes of cyber
incidents.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Outdated Nginx Version:</strong> Nginx version 1.18.0 was
released in 2020 and reached End-of-Life (EOL) in 2021. This means it no
longer receives security updates, making it highly vulnerable to known
and newly discovered exploits. Running EOL software on an
internet-facing service is a critical security risk.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>SSL Certificate Mismatch:</strong> The SSL certificate
presented by the server on port 443 is for
<code>www.acme-corp.com</code>, not for Aeon Pharmaceuticals. This could
indicate a misconfiguration, a shared hosting environment with another
entity, or potentially a security incident where an incorrect
certificate is being presented. This poses a trust issue and could
impact legitimate secure communication.</p></li>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and improve Aeon Pharmaceuticals’
cybersecurity posture, the following recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade/Patch Nginx Server:</strong> Immediately upgrade
the Nginx web server on <code>192.168.10.5</code> to the latest stable
and supported version. Alternatively, replace it with a currently
supported web server solution. Ensure regular patching and updates are
part of an ongoing maintenance schedule.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> Deploy
and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication for all systems that store,
process, or transmit sensitive organizational data. This will
significantly reduce the risk of credential compromise leading to data
breaches.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a comprehensive AUP that outlines employee
responsibilities and acceptable conduct regarding organizational IT
resources. Communicate this policy clearly to all employees and obtain
their acknowledgment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish a Comprehensive Security Awareness Training
(SAT) Program:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Conduct mandatory security awareness training for all new
employees during their onboarding process.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement annual mandatory security awareness training for all
employees, covering topics such as phishing, social engineering, data
handling, and strong password practices.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Correct SSL Certificate Configuration:</strong>
Investigate and rectify the SSL certificate mismatch on
<code>192.168.10.5</code>. Ensure that the certificate installed is
valid, current, and issued for the correct domain
(<code>AeonPharmaceuticals.org</code> or a relevant subdomain) to
maintain trust and secure communication.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Vulnerability Scanning:</strong> Implement a
schedule for regular internal and external vulnerability scanning to
proactively identify and address security weaknesses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Incident Response Plan:</strong> Develop and test an
incident response plan to ensure the organization can effectively
detect, respond to, and recover from cybersecurity incidents.</p></li>
