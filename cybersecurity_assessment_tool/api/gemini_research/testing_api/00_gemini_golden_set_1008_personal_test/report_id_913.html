<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings from a cybersecurity posture
assessment conducted for Atlas Mapping. The assessment involved
reviewing organizational security controls via a questionnaire and
analyzing network scan results. Key findings indicate several critical
security gaps, including a lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
email and sensitive data systems, absence of security awareness training
for new employees, and the presence of an outdated and unsupported Nginx
web server. These issues represent significant risks that could be
exploited by malicious actors. Immediate attention and remediation
efforts are highly recommended to enhance the organization’s security
posture and reduce its attack surface.</p>

</ul>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of
Technical Findings</h3>
<p>The Nginx web server running version 1.18.0 on port 443 is a
significant concern. Nginx 1.18.x reached its End-of-Life (EoL) in April
2021, meaning it no longer receives security updates or bug fixes.
Running an EoL software version exposes the server to known and future
vulnerabilities for which no patches will be released, making it a
high-risk target for exploitation. Common vulnerabilities include remote
code execution, denial of service, and information disclosure. The SSL
certificate’s common name, <code>www.acme-corp.com</code>, also suggests
a potential discrepancy if <code>AtlasMapping.com</code> is the intended
domain, which could lead to browser warnings or trust issues for users,
although this is not a direct security vulnerability in itself.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the security questionnaire and technical
scan results, the following risks have been identified:</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and significantly improve Atlas
Mapping’s overall cybersecurity posture, the following actionable
recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email
Access:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Enable and enforce MFA for all user accounts accessing email
services. This significantly reduces the risk of account compromise even
if passwords are stolen, offering a critical layer of defense against
phishing and credential-based attacks.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive
Data Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Extend MFA requirements to all systems and applications that
store or process sensitive organizational data to prevent unauthorized
access. Prioritize systems based on data criticality and regulatory
compliance needs.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Mandatory Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and implement a mandatory security awareness training
program for all new hires, ideally as an integral part of their
onboarding process. This training should cover topics such as phishing,
social engineering, password hygiene, and company-specific security
policies.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade and Maintain Nginx Web Server:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Immediately plan and execute an upgrade of the Nginx web server
from the End-of-Life version 1.18.0 to a current, stable, and officially
supported version (e.g., Nginx 1.26.x or the latest stable release).
Ensure proper testing is conducted before deploying to
production.</p></li>
<li><p>Establish and adhere to a regular patching and update schedule
for all software, especially public-facing services, to ensure security
vulnerabilities are promptly addressed.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct a comprehensive review of the SSL certificate configured
on the Nginx server to ensure it is valid, unexpired, and aligns with
the organization’s current domain (<code>AtlasMapping.com</code>) to
maintain trust and prevent browser warnings.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish a Vulnerability Management
Program:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement a continuous vulnerability scanning and management
program across the entire IT infrastructure. This includes regular
scans, prioritization of findings, and a structured remediation process
to proactively identify and address security weaknesses before they can
be exploited.</p></li>
</ul></li>
