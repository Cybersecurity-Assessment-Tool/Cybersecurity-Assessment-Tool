<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This report details the findings from a cybersecurity posture
assessment conducted for Maple Leaf Logistics. The assessment
synthesizes data from a security control questionnaire, a network
vulnerability scan, and a review of current organizational risks. The
objective is to provide an objective overview of the current security
state, identify potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses, and propose
actionable recommendations for improvement.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following information was provided for the organization under
assessment:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Organization Name:</strong> Maple Leaf Logistics</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Email Domain:</strong>
<code>MapleLeafLogistics.com</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Website Domain:</strong>

<li><p><strong>External IP Address:</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A questionnaire was used to assess the implementation of key security
controls within the organization. The responses indicate a strong
commitment to Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) but highlight
significant areas for improvement regarding security awareness and
policy enforcement.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on the target using Nmap. The scan aimed
to identify open ports, running services, and potential
vulnerabilities.</p>
<h2 id="scan-details">Scan Details</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> 2026-01-27</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="findings">Findings</h2>
<p>The Nmap scan against reported no open ports. All extra ports were
reported as closed, and the host status was up. This indicates a
well-secured or heavily filtered target, at least from the perspective
of external port exposure to the scanning host. No active services were
identified, suggesting a strong perimeter defense or that the target is
intentionally isolated.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the questionnaire responses, the technical
scan, and the provided current risks, the following risks have been
identified:</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To enhance Maple Leaf Logistics’ cybersecurity posture, the following
recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Draft a clear, comprehensive AUP that outlines acceptable and
unacceptable use of company IT resources, data, and communication
systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure the policy covers areas such as password hygiene, data
handling, internet usage, software installation, and reporting security
incidents.</p></li>
<li><p>Distribute the AUP to all employees and require acknowledgment of
understanding and compliance.</p></li>
<li><p>Review and update the AUP annually or as organizational policies
and threats evolve.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Mandatory Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement a mandatory security awareness training program as part
of the onboarding process for all new hires.</p></li>
<li><p>The training should cover fundamental cybersecurity concepts,
common threats (e.g., phishing, malware), company policies (including
the AUP), and incident reporting procedures.</p></li>
<li><p>Utilize engaging and interactive training materials to ensure
comprehension and retention.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Annual Security Awareness Training for All
Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Conduct mandatory annual security awareness training for all
employees, regardless of their tenure.</p></li>
<li><p>Refresh key security concepts, update employees on emerging
threats and attack techniques, and reinforce the importance of
vigilance.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider phishing simulation exercises to test and improve
employee awareness and response.</p></li>
<li><p>Tailor training content to be relevant to different roles and
responsibilities within the organization.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Maintain Strong Network Perimeter Security:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>While the scan of showed no open ports, continuous vigilance is
key. Regularly review firewall rules and network configurations to
ensure only necessary ports are open and services exposed.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDPS) and
regularly review logs for suspicious activity.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Continue Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Best
Practices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Commendable use of MFA. Continue to enforce and expand MFA where
appropriate, especially for remote access, cloud services, and
privileged accounts.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Maple Leaf Logistics has a solid foundation with MFA implementation,
but there are critical, easily remediable gaps in policy and training
that expose the organization to significant human-element risks.
Addressing the lack of an Acceptable Use Policy and comprehensive
Security Awareness Training for both new and existing employees will
significantly improve the organization’s overall security posture and
resilience against common cyber threats. The positive technical scan
results for the specified target are an encouraging sign of effective
network segmentation or perimeter control for that particular asset.</p>
