<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for Signal Flare, integrating data from a network scan, organizational
security questionnaire responses, and a review of reported pre-existing
risks.</p>
<p>The assessment indicates a foundational level of security controls
with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enabled for computer logins and
sensitive data systems, along with an acceptable use policy and annual
security awareness training. However, two significant security gaps were
identified from the questionnaire: the lack of MFA for email access and
the absence of security awareness training for new employees. These
deficiencies represent critical risks that could lead to account
compromise and successful social engineering attacks.</p>
<p>Technically, a recent network scan revealed one open port, SSH (Port
22), on the target host . While SSH is essential for remote
administration, its exposure warrants careful hardening to prevent
unauthorized access. No pre-existing vulnerabilities were reported.</p>
<p>Immediate recommendations include implementing MFA for email,
mandatory security awareness training for new hires, and hardening all
exposed SSH services.</p>

<p>A network scan was performed on the target host . The scan date was

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target Host:</strong></p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 22/tcp:</strong> State: Open</p>

</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of
Technical Findings</h3>
<p>The presence of an open SSH service (Port 22) indicates that remote
administration or file transfer capabilities are enabled on the target
host. While SSH is a legitimate and secure protocol when properly
configured, it is a frequent target for brute-force attacks and
exploitation if weak credentials, default configurations, or unpatched
vulnerabilities are present. The lack of detailed service and version
information prevents a deeper analysis of potential known
vulnerabilities for this specific SSH implementation.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the questionnaire responses and technical
scan data, the following risks have been identified:</p>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of MFA for Email</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Email accounts without MFA are highly
susceptible to compromise via phishing, credential stuffing, or password
reuse. A compromised email account can lead to further breaches (e.g.,
password resets for other services, business email compromise).</td>

<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">No Security Awareness Training for New
Employees</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">New employees, unfamiliar with
organizational security policies and common threats, are particularly
vulnerable to social engineering and phishing attacks. This increases
the risk of successful attacks against the organization.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">High</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Exposed SSH Service (Port 22)</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">An open SSH port, especially without
detailed configuration or version information, represents an attack
surface. Without proper hardening (e.g., strong authentication, disabled
root login, rate limiting), it can be susceptible to brute-force attacks
or exploitation of software vulnerabilities.</td>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and enhance Signal Flare’s
cybersecurity posture, the following recommendations are provided:</p>
<h2 id="immediate-actions">Immediate Actions</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Access:</strong> Mandate
Multi-Factor Authentication for all email accounts across the
organization. This significantly reduces the risk of account compromise,
even if an employee’s password is stolen.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mandatory New Employee Security Awareness
Training:</strong> Establish and enforce a mandatory security awareness
training program for all new hires, to be completed before they gain
access to company systems. This should cover phishing, social
engineering, password best practices, and organizational security
policies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Harden SSH Service (Port 22):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Disable root login via SSH.</p></li>
<li><p>Enforce strong, complex passwords or, ideally, implement
key-based authentication for all SSH access.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement rate limiting and IP-based access restrictions on the
SSH service to prevent brute-force attacks.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure the SSH server software is kept up-to-date with the latest
security patches.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider changing the default SSH port (22) to a non-standard
port, which can deter casual scanning and automated attacks.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="ongoing-best-practices">Ongoing Best Practices</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Regular Security Audits:</strong> Conduct regular,
comprehensive security audits, including authenticated vulnerability
scans and penetration tests, to identify new weaknesses as the
environment evolves.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Continuous Employee Training:</strong> Supplement annual
security awareness training with regular, targeted communications (e.g.,
phishing simulations, security bulletins) to keep security top-of-mind
for all employees.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Patch Management:</strong> Implement a robust patch
management program to ensure all operating systems, applications, and
network devices are regularly updated with the latest security
patches.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Incident Response Plan:</strong> Develop, document, and
regularly test an incident response plan to ensure the organization can
effectively detect, respond to, and recover from security
incidents.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Detailed Network Scans:</strong> Conduct network scans
with service version detection (‘-sV‘ in Nmap) to gain deeper insights
into running services and potential known vulnerabilities.</p></li>
