<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details a cybersecurity assessment conducted for
<strong>Vanguard Heritage</strong>. The assessment involved a
multi-faceted approach, including a review of organizational security
controls via a questionnaire and a technical network scan targeting a
specific IP address.</p>
<p>Overall, the organization demonstrates a strong foundational posture
with robust policies and training programs in place, as indicated by the
questionnaire responses. All critical security controls surveyed, such
as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) requirements and security awareness
training, are reportedly implemented.</p>
<p>However, the technical network scan identified an outdated web server
(Nginx 1.18.0) running on port 443. This represents a <strong>High
severity</strong> vulnerability due to the potential presence of
unpatched security flaws that could be exploited by adversaries. No
pre-existing vulnerabilities were provided for this assessment,
indicating a clean slate in that specific input, but the outdated
software presents a new, significant risk.</p>
<p>Key recommendations focus on immediate remediation of the outdated
software, implementation of a robust patch management program, and
continuous vulnerability scanning to maintain and improve the
organization’s security posture.</p>

<h2 id="detailed-technical-findings">Detailed Technical Findings</h2>
<p>The scan identified an Nginx web server, version 1.18.0, running on
port 443. Nginx 1.18.0 was released in April 2020. As of the current
assessment date, this version is considered significantly outdated. The
latest stable branch of Nginx is typically 1.24.x (or newer), with
mainline development at 1.25.x (or newer). Running an outdated version
of server software, especially a public-facing web server, dramatically
increases the risk of exposure to publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs)
for which patches have been released in newer versions. While the scan
itself did not identify specific CVEs, the general security posture
demands that all public-facing services be kept up-to-date with the
latest stable releases to ensure all known security patches are
applied.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the provided data inputs, one primary
technical risk has been identified. It is important to note that the
‘Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON‘ provided was empty, indicating no
pre-existing vulnerabilities were recorded or available for correlation
in this specific input.</p>

<td style="text-align: left;">The Nginx web server running on
<code>192.168.10.5</code> (port 443, version 1.18.0) is severely
outdated. This version is likely susceptible to multiple known
vulnerabilities that have been patched in more recent releases. An
attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized
access, deface the website, or compromise the underlying server.</td>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and further enhance Vanguard
Heritage’s cybersecurity posture, the following actionable
recommendations are provided:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade Nginx Web Server:</strong> Immediately plan and
execute an upgrade of the Nginx web server on <code>192.168.10.5</code>
(or the equivalent production system) to the latest stable version
(e.g., 1.24.x or newer). Prioritize this upgrade, ensuring proper
testing in a staging environment before deployment to
production.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement a Robust Patch Management Program:</strong>
Establish or enhance a comprehensive patch management program that
covers all operating systems, applications, and network devices. This
should include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Regular vulnerability scanning to identify outdated software and
missing patches.</p></li>
<li><p>Scheduled patching cycles to ensure timely application of
security updates.</p></li>
<li><p>Automated deployment tools where feasible.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Regular Vulnerability Scanning:</strong>
Implement a schedule for regular, automated vulnerability scans against
all external-facing assets and internal infrastructure. These scans
should be followed by a formal review process to identify and prioritize
remediation efforts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Perform Security Hardening Review:</strong> Conduct a
detailed security hardening review of the Nginx server configuration and
other public-facing services. This should include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Disabling unnecessary modules and features.</p></li>
<li><p>Implementing strong TLS/SSL configurations (e.g., TLS 1.2/1.3,
strong cipher suites).</p></li>
<li><p>Ensuring proper logging and monitoring is in place.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Maintain Strong Security Policies and Training:</strong>
Continue to enforce and periodically review the strong security policies
and security awareness training programs already in place. These
foundational controls are crucial for maintaining a strong human
firewall and defending against social engineering and other
threats.</p></li>
