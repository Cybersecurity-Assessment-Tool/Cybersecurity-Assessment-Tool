<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This document presents a detailed cybersecurity assessment report for
<strong>Terraform Global</strong>. The objective of this assessment is
to evaluate the current security posture by reviewing existing
organizational policies and technical configurations. The insights
derived from this analysis aim to identify potential vulnerabilities,
risks, and provide strategic recommendations for improvement.</p>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A review of key security controls was conducted based on responses to
a provided questionnaire. The findings highlight the current state of
implementation for several critical security practices.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-security-controls">Analysis of Security
Controls</h2>
<p>The questionnaire responses indicate a mixed security posture. While
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is implemented for email and computer
logins, its absence for sensitive data systems is a significant concern.
Furthermore, the lack of an Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and
comprehensive security awareness training (both for new and existing
employees) represents critical gaps in the organization’s human and
policy-based security layers.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on the specified target to identify open
ports, running services, and potential vulnerabilities.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Target:</strong> <code>192.168.1.100</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> N/A (Date information not available
in provided scan data)</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="detailed-scan-findings">Detailed Scan Findings</h2>
<p>The Nmap scan against <code>192.168.1.100</code> reported no open
ports or services. The ‘extraports_state‘ was ‘closed‘, meaning all
other ports not specifically enumerated were found to be closed. This
indicates that the scanned host is either well-hardened against external
(or internal, depending on scan context) enumeration, or it simply does
not have any services listening on standard ports. While this is a
positive finding in terms of direct network exposure, it’s important to
note that a lack of open ports does not inherently mean complete
security, as vulnerabilities can exist at other layers (e.g.,
application layer, misconfigurations). No specific service versions or
products could be identified due to the absence of open ports.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section consolidates identified risks from the organizational
control review and technical findings. No pre-existing vulnerabilities

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the assessment findings, the following recommendations are
provided to enhance <strong>Terraform Global</strong>’s cybersecurity
posture:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for All Sensitive Data Systems:</strong>
Prioritize the deployment and enforcement of Multi-Factor Authentication
for all systems storing or processing sensitive data. This adds a
crucial layer of security against credential theft and unauthorized
access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a comprehensive AUP that clearly defines the
acceptable use of company IT resources, data, and internet access.
Ensure all employees read, understand, and sign this policy to establish
clear expectations and accountability.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Mandatory New Employee Security Awareness
Training:</strong> Develop and implement a mandatory security awareness
training program for all new hires. This training should cover topics
such as phishing, malware, password hygiene, social engineering, and the
AUP, integrating security best practices from day one.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Regular (Annual) Security Awareness Training for
All Employees:</strong> Implement a recurring security awareness
training program for all employees, at least annually. This training
should be engaging, updated with current threat landscapes, and
reinforced through phishing simulations and ongoing communications to
maintain a high level of security consciousness.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Expand Network Scanning Scope:</strong> While the current
scan found no open ports, consider broadening the scope of network scans
to cover other internal segments, external-facing assets, and different
port ranges. Regularly scheduled vulnerability scanning and penetration
testing should also be considered to identify deeper-seated
issues.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The cybersecurity assessment of <strong>Terraform Global</strong>
highlights a strong performance in network hardening for the scanned
target but reveals critical deficiencies in foundational organizational
security controls. Addressing the lack of MFA for sensitive data
systems, implementing an AUP, and establishing robust security awareness
training programs are paramount steps to significantly mitigate human
and policy-based risks. Proactive implementation of these
recommendations will substantially strengthen the organization’s overall
security posture and resilience against evolving cyber threats.</p>
