<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for True North Travel, based on an external network scan, a review of
organizational security controls, and an analysis of pre-existing risk
data. Our findings indicate a foundational commitment to certain
security practices, such as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email
access and an employee acceptable use policy. However, critical gaps
exist concerning the widespread implementation of MFA for computer
logins and access to sensitive data systems, as well as a lack of
regular, organization-wide security awareness training. An open SSH port
was also identified during the network scan, representing a potential
entry point that requires diligent monitoring and securing. Addressing
these identified risks is crucial for enhancing the overall security
posture and reducing the attack surface against modern cyber
threats.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An Nmap scan was conducted against the target ‘2001:db8::1‘. The scan
metadata indicates that the target was online.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of Technical
Findings</h2>
<p>The presence of an open SSH (Port 22) port indicates that the system
is likely configured for remote access. While SSH is a secure protocol
when configured correctly, it represents an exposed attack surface.
Without detailed version information, it is not possible to determine if
outdated or vulnerable SSH versions are in use. Best practices for
securing SSH include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ensuring strong, complex passwords or, preferably, key-based
authentication with passphrases.</p></li>
<li><p>Disabling root login directly via SSH.</p></li>
<li><p>Restricting SSH access to known, trusted IP addresses or
networks.</p></li>
<li><p>Keeping SSH daemon software updated to the latest stable
version.</p></li>
<li><p>Implementing MFA for SSH access, if supported and
feasible.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>

critical assets, preventing unauthorized access even if a user’s primary
credentials are breached.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Priority:</em> Critical</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Annual Security Awareness Training for All
Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Develop and implement a mandatory, annual
security awareness training program for all employees. This training
should cover current threats such as phishing, ransomware, social
engineering tactics, data handling best practices, and organizational
security policies.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Empowers employees to recognize and report
threats effectively, fostering a stronger human firewall and reducing
the likelihood of successful social engineering attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Priority:</em> High</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Harden and Monitor SSH Access (Port 22):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Conduct a thorough review and implement SSH
hardening best practices:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Disable password-based authentication; strictly enforce strong,
cryptographically secure key-based authentication.</p></li>
<li><p>Disable direct root login via SSH.</p></li>
<li><p>Restrict SSH access to specific, trusted source IP addresses or
subnets using firewall rules.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure the SSH daemon software is regularly patched and updated
to the latest stable version to mitigate known vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement robust logging and monitoring solutions for all SSH
access attempts and failures, with alerts for suspicious
activity.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider implementing MFA for SSH access where supported by the
infrastructure.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Reduces the attack surface and significantly
mitigates the risk of unauthorized access, brute-force attacks, or
exploitation through SSH.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Priority:</em> Medium</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>While True North Travel demonstrates a foundational awareness of
cybersecurity through certain implemented controls, there are clear and
significant areas for improvement, particularly concerning the
comprehensive implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication and ongoing,
organization-wide security awareness training. Proactively addressing
the identified risks and diligently implementing the recommended
measures will significantly strengthen the organization’s cybersecurity
posture, better protecting its valuable assets and data from evolving
cyber threats.</p>
