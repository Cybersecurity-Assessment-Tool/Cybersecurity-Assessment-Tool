<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides an assessment of <strong>Swift Current
Labs</strong>’s cybersecurity posture based on a security questionnaire
and a perimeter network scan. The organization demonstrates some
foundational security practices, such as Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) for computer login and sensitive data systems, and initial
security awareness training for new employees. However, critical gaps
were identified in key areas, including the absence of MFA for email
access, the lack of a formal employee acceptable use policy, and
insufficient annual security awareness training for all employees. The
perimeter scan did not identify any immediate external vulnerabilities
or open services on the scanned target, but this should not be taken as
a complete security guarantee without further internal and external
testing. Addressing the identified control deficiencies is crucial to
enhance the overall security posture and reduce organizational risk.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A perimeter network scan was conducted to identify externally
accessible services and potential vulnerabilities.</p>
<h2 id="scan-details">Scan Details</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target Scanned:</strong> <code>[Target IP]</code> (The
provided target IP was empty, hence this placeholder is used.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> No specific scan date
provided.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="findings">Findings</h2>
<p>The perimeter network scan on the specified target yielded no
findings of open ports or services. This indicates that, at the time of
the scan, there were no immediately apparent external attack surfaces on
the provided target. It is important to note that an empty target IP
means no actual scan was performed; therefore, this should not be
interpreted as a clean bill of health without a valid target for a
comprehensive scan. This also does not preclude the existence of
internal vulnerabilities or misconfigurations, or vulnerabilities on
other external hosts not included in the scope of this (empty) scan.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the security questionnaire, several critical
risks and control gaps have been identified. No pre-existing
vulnerabilities were provided in the input data, and the technical scan
did not identify any new findings due to an empty target.</p>
<h2 id="identified-risks">Identified Risks</h2>
<p>The primary risks are derived from the "No" answers in the security
control review. These represent significant weaknesses in the
organization’s security posture.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and strengthen <strong>Swift Current
Labs</strong>’s cybersecurity posture, the following recommendations are
provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Access:</strong> Immediately
deploy and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all user
accounts accessing company email services. This significantly raises the
bar for attackers attempting to gain unauthorized access, even if
passwords are compromised through phishing or other means.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a clear and comprehensive AUP that outlines
employee responsibilities for using company IT assets, data, and
networks. Ensure all employees read, understand, and formally
acknowledge this policy. Integrate it into new hire onboarding processes
and review it annually.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Annual All-Employee Security Awareness
Training:</strong> Conduct mandatory, annual security awareness training
for all employees, not just new hires. This training should be updated
regularly to cover current threats (e.g., phishing, social engineering,
ransomware), company policies, data handling best practices, and
incident reporting procedures. Regular refreshers are crucial for
maintaining a strong security culture and keeping employees
informed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Comprehensive Vulnerability Assessments (External
and Internal):</strong> While the initial perimeter scan yielded no
findings (due to an empty target), it is strongly recommended to perform
regular, authenticated vulnerability scans and penetration tests. These
should cover both external (with a valid target IP) and internal
networks, as well as critical applications, to identify potential
weaknesses in systems, software, and network configurations before they
can be exploited by malicious actors.</p></li>
