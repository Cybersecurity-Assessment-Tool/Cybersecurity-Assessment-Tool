<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for Velocity Ventures, based on a combination of organizational data, a
security questionnaire review, and external network scanning results
conducted on 2026-01-26.</p>
<p>Overall, the external network posture appears robust with no open
ports identified on the scanned target, indicating a minimal direct
attack surface from unauthenticated external access. This suggests a
good baseline for perimeter defense against common network-based
attacks.</p>
<p>However, several critical internal control gaps were identified
through the security questionnaire. Specifically, the lack of
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and access to
sensitive data systems, along with the absence of dedicated security
awareness training for new employees, pose significant internal risks.
While an Acceptable Use Policy is in place and annual security training
is conducted for all employees, these specific MFA and onboarding
training omissions create exploitable vulnerabilities for initial
access, privilege escalation, and successful social engineering within
the organization.</p>
<p>No pre-existing vulnerabilities or risks were reported by Velocity
Ventures at the time of this assessment. Addressing the identified
internal control weaknesses should be prioritized to enhance the overall
security posture.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed on the target IP address .</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> 2026-01-26</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Type:</strong> Nmap default scan</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The external network scan revealed no open ports on the target host .
All scanned ports were reported as closed.</p>
<p>This is a positive security finding, as it indicates a minimal
external attack surface directly exposed via common network services.
The absence of open ports reduces the likelihood of external attackers
exploiting vulnerable services or gaining initial access through
network-based attacks. No specific services, products, or versions could
be identified, as no ports were found to be open.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>

scan results, the following risks have been identified:</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and further enhance Velocity
Ventures’ cybersecurity posture, the following recommendations are
provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Logins:</strong> Immediately
implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer login
processes across the organization, including both local and domain
logins. This crucial security measure will significantly reduce the risk
of unauthorized access even if user credentials are stolen, as an
attacker would also need access to the second authentication
factor.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> Extend
MFA requirements to all systems storing or processing sensitive
organizational data (e.g., CRM, ERP, HR systems, financial databases,
cloud storage with sensitive content). This adds a crucial layer of
security, protecting critical assets from unauthorized access and
potential data breaches.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Initiate Mandatory Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong> Establish a mandatory and comprehensive security
awareness training program for all new employees as an integral part of
their onboarding process. This training should cover essential topics
such as phishing identification, social engineering tactics, strong
password hygiene, recognizing malware, and adherence to internal
security policies. Regular refreshers should also be
considered.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Review and Updates of Security Policies:</strong>
Regularly review and update all security policies and controls,
including the acceptable use policy and security awareness training
content, to ensure they remain current and adapt to the evolving threat
landscape and organizational changes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Consider Proactive Vulnerability Management:</strong>
While no open ports were found externally, consider implementing regular
internal and external vulnerability scanning and penetration testing.
This proactive approach will help identify and remediate potential
weaknesses, misconfigurations, and outdated software versions before
they can be exploited by malicious actors, encompassing both network and
application layers.</p></li>
