<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment for <strong>North Star Education</strong>. The assessment
involved reviewing organizational security controls via a questionnaire,
analyzing network scan data, and incorporating existing risk
information.</p>
<p>Key findings indicate significant gaps in foundational security
controls, particularly regarding Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
implementation for email and computer access, and the absence of an
Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and security awareness training for new
employees. The external network scan also confirmed a critical
vulnerability: an exposed MySQL database. While some controls are in
place (MFA for sensitive data systems, annual security awareness
training), the overall posture suggests a high level of exposure to
common cyber threats due to critical deficiencies in preventative
measures and a directly exposed sensitive service. Immediate attention
to the recommendations outlined in this report is strongly advised to
mitigate identified risks and improve the organization’s security
posture.</p>

<p>A review of the organization’s self-reported security controls

</p>
</div>
<p>The presence of an open MySQL port (<code>3306</code>) running
version <code>5.7.33</code> on the target system is a significant
finding. While MySQL 5.7 is a stable and widely used version, exposing a
database port directly to the network without adequate protection (e.g.,
firewall rules, VPN) is a critical security configuration issue. This
direct exposure significantly increases the attack surface for
database-related exploits, unauthorized access, and potential data
breaches. This technical finding corroborates the existing risk of
"Database Exposure".</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actionable recommendations are provided to address the
identified risks and significantly improve the overall cybersecurity
posture of <strong>North Star Education</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Broadly:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Email Access:</strong> Mandate MFA for all email accounts
across the organization. This is a critical first line of defense
against phishing and credential stuffing attacks, significantly reducing
the risk of email account compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Computer Logins:</strong> Implement MFA for all computer
logins, especially for devices accessing sensitive data or networks.
This adds an essential layer of security beyond passwords.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Secure Database Exposure (Port
<code>3306</code>):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Mitigation (Firewall Rules):</strong> Restrict
direct network access to the MySQL server (on <code>172.16.50.20</code>,
port <code>3306</code>). Implement firewall rules to allow connections
only from specific, authorized internal IP addresses or application
servers that absolutely require access. Block all other inbound
connections to this port.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Long-Term Solution (VPN/SSH Tunneling):</strong> For any
necessary remote administration or development access, enforce the use
of a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or secure SSH tunneling. Database
access should never be directly exposed to the general network.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Database Hardening:</strong> Ensure the MySQL server
itself is configured with security best practices, including strong,
unique passwords for all accounts, regular patching, principle of least
privilege for database users, and encryption of data at rest and in
transit.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create a formal, comprehensive AUP that clearly outlines the
rules and expectations for employees regarding the use of all
organizational IT resources, including computers, networks, internet,
email, and software. Distribute the policy widely and require
acknowledgement from all employees.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Enhance Security Awareness Training Program:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Mandatory New Employee Training:</strong> Implement
mandatory security awareness training as part of the onboarding process
for all new hires. This ensures a foundational understanding of security
policies, common threats, and reporting procedures from day
one.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ongoing Training Enhancement:</strong> While annual
training is conducted, review and update its content regularly to cover
evolving threats (e.g., ransomware, social engineering tactics, supply
chain attacks). Consider more frequent, shorter training modules or
simulated phishing exercises to reinforce learning.</p></li>
