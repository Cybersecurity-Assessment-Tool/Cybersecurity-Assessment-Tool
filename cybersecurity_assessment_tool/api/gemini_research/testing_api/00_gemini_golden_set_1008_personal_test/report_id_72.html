<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment for Oasis Wellness. The assessment involved reviewing
provided organizational data, a security questionnaire, and attempting
to analyze network scan results and pre-existing risk information.</p>
<p>Key findings include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strong Foundational Controls:</strong> The organization
demonstrates good adherence to several foundational security practices,
including requiring Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and
computer logins, maintaining an acceptable use policy, and conducting
regular security awareness training.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Critical Security Gap Identified:</strong> A significant
risk was identified regarding the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems. This oversight could lead to
unauthorized access to critical information if credentials are
compromised.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data Limitations:</strong> Due to limitations and broken
data in the provided network scan and pre-existing vulnerability
information, a comprehensive technical vulnerability assessment could
not be performed. No technical findings from a network scan are present
in this report, and no pre-existing vulnerabilities were available for
analysis.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Recommendations focus on immediately addressing the identified MFA
gap and establishing processes for more comprehensive technical
assessments in the future.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following organizational details were gathered for the
assessment. Where specific data was not provided or was incomplete, a
placeholder has been used.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Organization Name:</strong> Oasis Wellness</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Email Domain:</strong>
<code>OasisWellness.org</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Website Domain:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>External IP Address:</strong>
<code>193.74.79.30</code></p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A review of the organization’s self-reported security controls was
conducted based on the provided questionnaire. The responses indicate
the current state of these controls.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>Due to limitations and broken data in the provided
‘Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON‘, the network scan results could not be
parsed, processed, or included in this report. Therefore, no technical
vulnerabilities were identified through automated scanning during this
assessment. A target IP address for the scan was also unavailable; for
future reference, it would have been <code>[Target IP]</code>.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the available information, the following risks have been
identified. It is important to note that this assessment is limited by
the lack of comprehensive technical scan data and pre-existing
vulnerability information.</p>

<td style="text-align: left;">The organization does not require
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems.
This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical

<td style="text-align: center;">High</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Undefined Technical Vulnerabilities</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Due to the inability to process network

misconfigurations, or unpatched systems that could be exploited by
malicious actors.</td>
