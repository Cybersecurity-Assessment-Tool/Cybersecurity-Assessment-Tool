<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture assessment for
<strong>Iron Bridge Legal</strong>, based on provided organizational
data, a security control questionnaire, and an external network scan.
The organization demonstrates foundational controls such as an
acceptable use policy and initial security awareness training. However,
critical vulnerabilities have been identified concerning Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) implementation for email and sensitive data
systems, alongside a lack of consistent annual security awareness
training for all employees. The external network scan for
<code>[Target IP]</code> did not identify any open ports, suggesting a
potentially hardened perimeter, but this finding is limited by the scope
of the scan. No pre-existing risks were reported. Addressing the
identified MFA and training gaps is crucial for significantly enhancing
the organization’s overall security posture and mitigating high-impact
risks.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and enhance the overall
cybersecurity posture of Iron Bridge Legal, the following actionable
recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
Email:</strong> Mandate and enforce MFA for all organizational email
accounts. This significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access,
even if user credentials are stolen or compromised, aligning with modern
security best practices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive
Data Systems:</strong> Enforce MFA for access to all systems and
applications that store, process, or transmit sensitive organizational
or client data. This adds a critical layer of defense against
unauthorized data access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Annual Security Awareness Training for All
Employees:</strong> Establish and implement a mandatory, annual security
awareness training program for all employees. This training should be
comprehensive, covering current threats (e.g., advanced phishing,
ransomware), organizational policies, and best practices for secure
computing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Perform Regular Vulnerability Assessments and Penetration
Testing:</strong> Initiate a program for regular external and internal
vulnerability assessments. Additionally, consider periodic penetration
testing to proactively identify and address potential weaknesses before
they can be exploited by malicious actors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Review and Update Security Policies and
Procedures:</strong> Regularly review and update existing security
policies, including the acceptable use policy, to ensure they remain
current, effective, and align with evolving threat landscapes,
technological changes, and regulatory requirements.</p></li>
