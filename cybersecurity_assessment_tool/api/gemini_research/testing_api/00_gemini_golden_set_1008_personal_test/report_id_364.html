<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture assessment for
<strong>Top Tier</strong>. The assessment integrates organizational
security control reviews, technical network scan results, and an
analysis of pre-existing risk data.</p>
<p>The technical scan of the target host <code>192.168.1.100</code>
indicated a robust configuration with no open ports detected, which is a
positive finding. However, a review of the organizational security
questionnaire revealed critical gaps in policy and implementation.
Specifically, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not universally
enforced for email access or sensitive data systems, and dedicated
security awareness training for new employees is absent. No pre-existing
vulnerabilities were provided for analysis.</p>
<p>These identified policy and procedural weaknesses pose significant
risks that could undermine the positive technical findings. Urgent
recommendations focus on implementing MFA where it is currently lacking
and establishing comprehensive security awareness training programs.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-questionnaire-findings">Analysis of Questionnaire
Findings</h2>
<p>The review highlights several critical areas requiring immediate
attention:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA for Email Access:</strong> The absence of MFA for
email access significantly increases the risk of account compromise
through phishing or credential stuffing attacks. Email accounts often
serve as a gateway to other critical systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> Failure to
enforce MFA for sensitive data systems leaves critical organizational
data vulnerable to unauthorized access, potentially leading to data
breaches and regulatory non-compliance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Security Awareness Training for New Employees:</strong>
New employees are often prime targets for social engineering attacks due
to their unfamiliarity with organizational security policies and common
threat vectors. The lack of immediate training represents a significant
initial vulnerability.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on a target internal IP address to
identify open ports and services.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> 2026-01-26</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanned Target:</strong>
<code>192.168.1.100</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> The host was detected as
<strong>Up</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports:</strong> No open ports were detected on the
scanned target. The target’s extraports state was reported as
closed.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of Technical
Findings</h2>
<p>The absence of open ports on the scanned target
<code>192.168.1.100</code> is a positive security indicator. It suggests
that this specific host is either well-firewalled or configured to
minimize its attack surface, at least from the perspective of the scan.
This reduces the immediate risk of external or network-based
exploitation against this particular device. It is important to note
that this finding applies only to the scanned target and does not
necessarily reflect the security posture of the entire network or other
systems.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the organizational security controls and
technical scan results, the following risks have been identified. No
pre-existing vulnerabilities were provided in the input data.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and enhance the overall cybersecurity
posture of <strong>Top Tier</strong>, the following recommendations are
provided:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Access:</strong> Mandate
Multi-Factor Authentication for all email accounts across the
organization. This should be a top priority due to the critical nature
of email in business operations and as an attack vector.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> Extend
the implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication to all systems that
store, process, or transmit sensitive organizational or client data.
Prioritize systems based on data classification and potential impact of
compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish New Employee Security Awareness
Training:</strong> Develop and implement a mandatory cybersecurity
awareness training program specifically for all new hires. This training
should be conducted as part of the onboarding process, before employees
gain full access to organizational systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Security Audits:</strong> Conduct periodic
comprehensive security audits that include penetration testing,
vulnerability assessments, and policy reviews to proactively identify
and remediate weaknesses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Continuous Employee Training:</strong> While annual
training is conducted, consider increasing the frequency or introducing
smaller, more targeted training modules throughout the year to reinforce
security best practices and address emerging threats.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>While the technical scan on the target <code>192.168.1.100</code>
showed positive results with no open ports, the organizational security
review revealed significant policy and procedural deficiencies,
particularly concerning the implementation of Multi-Factor
Authentication and security awareness training for new employees.
Addressing these gaps is paramount to fortifying <strong>Top
Tier</strong>’s defense against common and sophisticated cyber threats.
Proactive implementation of the recommended controls will significantly
reduce the organization’s overall risk exposure.</p>
