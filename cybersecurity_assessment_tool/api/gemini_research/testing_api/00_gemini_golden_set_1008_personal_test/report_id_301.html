<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This cybersecurity assessment for Clear Path has identified a mix of
strengths and critical weaknesses. While the organization employs MFA
for email and computer login, a significant gap exists with the lack of
MFA for sensitive data systems. Furthermore, the absence of an employee
acceptable use policy and annual security awareness training poses
substantial risks to internal security. Technical scans revealed an
outdated Nginx web server version on an internal host, presenting a
known vulnerability. The identified risks, ranging from High to
Critical, require immediate attention to mitigate potential exploitation
and improve compliance. Recommendations focus on implementing robust
access controls, enhancing policy and training frameworks, and
maintaining up-to-date software.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-gaps">Analysis of Gaps</h2>
<p>The "No" responses highlight significant security gaps that could
lead to increased risk:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> Lack of MFA for
sensitive data systems represents a critical vulnerability. If
credentials are compromised, an attacker could gain direct access to
critical information without a second layer of defense.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> The
absence of an AUP leaves the organization vulnerable to misuse of
company assets, intellectual property theft, and non-compliance with
regulatory requirements. It also creates ambiguity regarding employee
responsibilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Annual Security Awareness Training:</strong> While new
employees receive training, the lack of annual refreshers means that
security knowledge can degrade over time, and employees may not be aware
of evolving threats (e.g., new phishing tactics, social engineering
techniques).</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on the internal host on
2025-11-22T10:00:00Z. The scan identified the following open ports and
services:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Port:</strong> 443/TCP</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>State:</strong> Open</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Service:</strong> HTTPS (HTTP Secure)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Product:</strong> Nginx</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.18.0</p></li>
<li><p><strong>SSL Certificate Common Name:</strong>
<code>www.acme-corp.com</code></p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="technical-analysis">Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>The most significant finding from the technical scan is the presence
of Nginx version 1.18.0. Nginx 1.18.0 was released in 2020 and is now
considered end-of-life (EOL). It no longer receives security patches,
making it vulnerable to known exploits that have been discovered since
its release. Running EOL software is a high-risk security posture as it
leaves the service exposed to unpatched vulnerabilities that could lead
to compromise, data breaches, or denial of service. The certificate’s
common name ‘www.acme-corp.com‘ suggests this server might be serving an
internal application or acting as a proxy.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the questionnaire responses, technical scan
results, and current threat landscape, the following risks have been
identified:</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and enhance Clear Path’s
cybersecurity posture, the following recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade Nginx Server:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediately plan and execute an upgrade
of the Nginx server on to the latest stable version (e.g., Nginx 1.24.x
or 1.26.x).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mitigation:</strong> This will ensure the server benefits
from the latest security patches and bug fixes, reducing the attack
surface.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> High</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Conduct an inventory of all systems
storing or processing sensitive data and implement mandatory
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all access to these
systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Adds an essential layer of security,
significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access even if primary
credentials are stolen.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> Critical</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Draft and formalize a comprehensive
Employee Acceptable Use Policy outlining guidelines for the proper use
of company IT resources, data, and internet access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Distribute the AUP to all employees,
obtain signed acknowledgments, and integrate it into new employee
onboarding processes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Establishes clear expectations,
reduces insider threats, and helps demonstrate due diligence for
compliance purposes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> Medium</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Annual Security Awareness Training
Program:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Implement a mandatory annual security
awareness training program for all employees. The training should cover
current threats, organizational policies, and best practices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Track completion rates and reinforce key
messages periodically.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Educates employees on evolving cyber
threats, strengthens the human firewall, and fosters a
security-conscious culture.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> Medium</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement a Patch Management Strategy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop and enforce a formal patch
management policy and procedure for all operating systems, applications,
and network devices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Ensures all software is kept
up-to-date with security patches, preventing exploitation of known
vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> High (General, linked to Nginx
vulnerability)</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>This assessment highlights both the progress made by Clear Path in
certain security areas (MFA for email and computer login) and critical
deficiencies that require immediate attention. By addressing the
outlined risks and implementing the recommended actions, Clear Path can
significantly improve its overall cybersecurity posture, reduce its
attack surface, and enhance its resilience against cyber threats.
Continuous monitoring, regular assessments, and a proactive security
culture are paramount for long-term security success.</p>
