<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides an assessment of the current cybersecurity
posture for Paper Plane Publishing, based on organizational data,
security questionnaire responses, a network scan, and a review of
existing vulnerabilities. The overall posture is assessed as
<strong>Moderate Risk</strong>, primarily due to significant gaps in
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) implementation across critical access
points and a lack of consistent annual security awareness training.
While the recent network scan indicated a well-hardened external surface
with no open ports found, pre-existing organizational risks highlight
areas that require immediate attention. Addressing the identified
control deficiencies and reviewing existing risks is crucial for
enhancing the organization’s security posture against common attack
vectors.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-security-control-gaps">Analysis
of Security Control Gaps</h2>
<p>The questionnaire highlights critical weaknesses in the
organization’s security controls, particularly concerning Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) and ongoing security awareness training:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA:</strong> MFA is not required for email
access, computer logins, or sensitive data systems. This is a severe
vulnerability, as compromised credentials (e.g., via phishing) could
grant unauthorized access to critical systems and data without an
additional authentication factor.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training:</strong>
While new employees receive training, a lack of annual refresher
training means employees may not be kept up-to-date on evolving threats
and best practices, increasing the risk of human-error-based security
incidents.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was conducted on the specified target to identify open
ports and services.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Target:</strong> <code>192.168.0.5</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Type:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not provided in input data.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="detailed-scan-findings">Detailed Scan
Findings</h2>
<p>The network scan of <code>192.168.0.5</code> revealed that <strong>no
open ports were identified</strong>. All commonly scanned ports,
including port 80, were reported as ‘closed‘. This indicates a
well-hardened network perimeter for the scanned target from an external
perspective, with no exposed services directly accessible via these
ports.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and enhance the overall
cybersecurity posture of Paper Plane Publishing, the following
recommendations are provided:</p>
<h2 id="implement-multi-factor-authentication-mfa">Implement
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Mandate MFA for all access
points: email, computer logins, and access to sensitive data
systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Details:</strong> MFA adds an essential layer of
security, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access even if
primary credentials are compromised. Evaluate various MFA solutions
(e.g., authenticator apps, hardware tokens, biometrics) and implement
one that integrates well with existing infrastructure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> <strong>Critical</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="enhance-security-awareness-training-program">Enhance Security
Awareness Training Program</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Implement mandatory annual
security awareness training for all employees, in addition to new
employee onboarding training.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Details:</strong> Regular training ensures employees are
continually updated on emerging threats (e.g., phishing techniques,
social engineering), safe browsing practices, and company policies,
fostering a strong security culture.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> <strong>High</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<h2
id="review-and-address-pre-existing-unencrypted-web-server-risk">Review
and Address Pre-existing "Unencrypted Web Server" Risk</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Investigate the status of the
"Unencrypted Web Server" risk. While the recent scan showed port 80 as
closed, this was a pre-existing vulnerability.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Details:</strong> Confirm if there are other web servers
(internal or external) within the organization that might be serving
unencrypted HTTP traffic on port 80. If any are found, they should be
configured to use HTTPS with valid SSL/TLS certificates or be
decommissioned/blocked if not required. If the specific service related
to this pre-existing risk is confirmed to no longer exist or be exposed,
the risk can be closed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> <strong>Medium</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="continuous-monitoring-and-auditing">Continuous Monitoring and
Auditing</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Implement continuous monitoring
solutions for network activity, system logs, and security
configurations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Details:</strong> Regular auditing and vulnerability
scanning should be performed to proactively identify new weaknesses and
ensure that security controls remain effective over time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> <strong>Ongoing</strong></p></li>
