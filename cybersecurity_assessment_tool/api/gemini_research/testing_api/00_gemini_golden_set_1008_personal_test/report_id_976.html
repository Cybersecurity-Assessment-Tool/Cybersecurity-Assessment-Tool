<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of <strong>Vivid
Vision</strong>, based on a review of organizational security controls,
a targeted network scan, and an assessment of current risks. The
analysis reveals significant weaknesses in fundamental security
controls, particularly regarding Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and
Security Awareness Training. While a basic network scan of
<code>192.168.1.100</code> found no immediately open ports, this should
not be mistaken for a strong overall security posture.</p>
<p>The lack of MFA for email and computer logins, combined with the
absence of regular security awareness training, exposes the organization
to common and critical attack vectors like phishing, credential theft,
and social engineering. Addressing these human and process-related gaps
is paramount for improving the overall security posture and reducing the
likelihood of successful cyberattacks.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following information was provided for the assessment:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Organization Name</strong>: Vivid Vision</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Email Domain</strong>:

</ul>
<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A questionnaire was used to assess the current state of key security
controls within <strong>Vivid Vision</strong>. The responses are
detailed below:</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed to identify open ports and services on a
specified target.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP</strong>: <code>192.168.1.100</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date</strong>: Not specified</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Used</strong>: Nmap</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="findings">Findings</h2>
<p>The Nmap scan revealed that the target host
<code>192.168.1.100</code> was reported as <em>up</em>. However, no open
ports were identified during this scan. All probed extra ports were
reported as closed.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="analysis">Analysis</h3>
<p>This finding indicates a minimal exposed network attack surface from
the perspective of this specific unauthenticated scan. While this is
generally positive, it is crucial to note that this limited scan does
not provide insight into:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Internal network vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p>Application-layer weaknesses or misconfigurations on running
services (if any are present on non-probed ports).</p></li>
<li><p>Weaknesses that could be exploited through social engineering or
other non-network-based attack vectors.</p></li>
<li><p>Vulnerabilities on other internal systems not included in this
specific scan.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, the absence of open ports in this scan should not be
interpreted as comprehensive security.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the security control questionnaire and the
technical scan results, the following risks have been identified:</p>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Inadequate Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) Implementation</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">MFA is not required for accessing email or
logging into computers. This leaves accounts highly vulnerable to
credential theft via phishing, brute-force attacks, or password reuse,
as a single compromised password could grant full access to critical
systems and data.</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">High</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Lack of Comprehensive Security
Awareness Training</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The organization does not conduct security
awareness training for new employees, nor does it provide annual
training for all employees. This significantly increases the risk of
successful social engineering attacks, phishing, malware infections, and
policy violations due to a lack of employee understanding of cyber
threats and best practices.</td>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and enhance the overall cybersecurity
posture of <strong>Vivid Vision</strong>, the following recommendations
are provided:</p>
<h2 id="implement-broad-multi-factor-authentication-mfa">Implement Broad
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Mandate MFA for Email Access</strong>: Implement and
enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all employee access to
email systems. This adds a critical layer of security beyond just a
password.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mandate MFA for Computer Logins</strong>: Roll out MFA
for all computer and workstation logins, especially for administrative
accounts and users accessing sensitive data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Review Existing MFA Controls</strong>: While MFA is used
for sensitive data systems, it is recommended to regularly review its
configuration and ensure strong methods (e.g., authenticator apps,
hardware tokens) are prioritized over weaker ones (e.g., SMS-based
MFA).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2
id="establish-a-robust-security-awareness-training-program">Establish a
Robust Security Awareness Training Program</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>New Employee Training</strong>: Develop and implement
mandatory security awareness training for all new employees as part of
their onboarding process. This should cover fundamental cybersecurity
principles, phishing recognition, password hygiene, and the
organization’s acceptable use policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Annual Refresher Training</strong>: Conduct mandatory
annual security awareness training for all employees to reinforce
knowledge, update them on new threats, and maintain a vigilant security
culture.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Phishing Simulations</strong>: Supplement training with
regular phishing simulation exercises to test employee awareness and
provide targeted education.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2
id="conduct-regular-and-comprehensive-vulnerability-assessments">Conduct
Regular and Comprehensive Vulnerability Assessments</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Authenticated Internal Scans</strong>: Perform
authenticated, internal vulnerability scans to identify weaknesses
beyond the network perimeter, including operating system and application
vulnerabilities on internal assets. This provides a much deeper insight
than a basic unauthenticated scan.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Penetration Testing</strong>: Consider engaging in
regular penetration testing to simulate real-world attacks and validate
the effectiveness of existing security controls, processes, and employee
awareness.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="review-and-update-security-policies">Review and Update Security
Policies</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Policy Review</strong>: Ensure the existing Acceptable
Use Policy is regularly reviewed and updated to reflect current threats,
technological changes, and organizational practices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>New Policy Development</strong>: Develop and implement
specific policies for areas such as incident response, data
classification and handling, password complexity, and remote
access.</p></li>
