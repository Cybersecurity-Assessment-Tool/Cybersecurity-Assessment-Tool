<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">1. Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture assessment for Stellar
Pathways. The assessment was primarily based on self-reported
organizational data obtained through a security questionnaire. Due to
limitations in provided data, specifically the unavailability of network
scan results and pre-existing vulnerability information, this assessment
relies heavily on the documented security controls and practices of the
organization.</p>
<p>Key findings indicate significant gaps in critical security areas.
These include the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer
logins, the absence of a formal employee acceptable use policy, and
insufficient annual security awareness training for all employees. These
areas represent high-priority risks that require immediate attention to
enhance the organization’s overall security resilience and reduce its
attack surface.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="organizational-information">2. Organizational

<p>This section provides an overview of the organization under
assessment, based on the provided administrative data.</p>

Review</h1>
<p>A review of the organization’s self-reported security controls, based
on the questionnaire provided, is presented below. A checkmark ()
indicates that a control is reported to be in place, while an X-mark ()

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">4. Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>An attempt was made to analyze network scan data to identify open
ports, running services, product versions, and potential
vulnerabilities. However, the provided ‘Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON‘ data
was malformed and incomplete (indicated as ‘[BROKEN]‘), preventing any
meaningful analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Target IP Address for Scan:</strong> <code>[Target IP]</code>
(No scan data was provided for analysis against this target.)</p>
<p>Therefore, this section cannot provide specific technical findings
related to network configurations or software versions. It is strongly
recommended that a comprehensive network scan be conducted and its
results analyzed in a subsequent assessment to gain a full understanding
of the organization’s technical attack surface.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment">5. Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the available organizational data, particularly the critical
gaps identified in the security control review (Section 3), the
following risks have been identified. It is important to note that this
assessment does not include risks derived from network scans or
pre-existing vulnerability databases, as that data was unavailable
during this review.</p>

<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of MFA for Computer Logins</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Without Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
for computer logins, an attacker who compromises user credentials (e.g.,
through phishing or password reuse) can gain direct access to internal

</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Absence of Employee Acceptable Use
Policy</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">A lack of a formal Employee Acceptable Use
Policy (AUP) means employees may not be fully aware of the appropriate
use of company IT resources. This can lead to unintentional misuse,
risky behavior (e.g., unauthorized software installations, risky website
browsing), compliance issues, and increased exposure to malware.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Medium</td>

<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Insufficient Annual Security Awareness
Training</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Failing to provide regular, at least
annual, security awareness training for all employees leaves the
organization vulnerable to evolving cyber threats. Employees are often
the first line of defense, and outdated knowledge increases the
likelihood of successful social engineering attacks, phishing campaigns,
or malware infections.</td>

</div>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">6. Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the identified risks and gaps in the cybersecurity posture,
the following actionable recommendations are provided to enhance Stellar
Pathways’ security.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for All Computer Logins:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediately deploy and enforce
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all user logins to company
computers, laptops, and other endpoints. Integrate MFA with existing
identity management solutions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Significantly reduces the risk of
unauthorized access to internal systems, even if primary credentials are
stolen or compromised. This adds a crucial layer of security.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Create a comprehensive AUP that clearly
outlines employee responsibilities, permitted and prohibited activities,
and consequences of non-compliance regarding company IT assets,
networks, and data. Distribute it to all employees and obtain signed
acknowledgments of understanding.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Establishes clear guidelines for
employee behavior, reduces risky practices, mitigates legal and
compliance risks, and reinforces a culture of security.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Mandatory Annual Security Awareness Training for
All Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Establish and regularly conduct a
mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees.
The training should cover current threats such as phishing, social
engineering tactics, strong password hygiene, data handling best
practices, and incident reporting procedures.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Equips employees with the necessary
knowledge and skills to identify and mitigate cyber threats, effectively
transforming them into a stronger defensive layer against attacks and
reducing human error-related incidents.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Comprehensive Network Scans and Vulnerability
Assessments:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Engage qualified cybersecurity
professionals to perform regular, in-depth external and internal network
vulnerability scans and, if appropriate, penetration tests. The results
should be thoroughly analyzed to identify and remediate technical
weaknesses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Provides a complete technical picture
of the organization’s external and internal attack surface, uncovering
system and application vulnerabilities that self-reported data cannot.
This is crucial for proactive risk management.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish a Vulnerability Management
Program:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Implement systematic processes for
continuously identifying, assessing, prioritizing, tracking, and
remediating vulnerabilities across all IT systems, applications, and
infrastructure components.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Proactively addresses known security
weaknesses, reducing the window of opportunity for attackers and
improving the overall security posture over time.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">7. Conclusion</h1>
<p>This assessment highlights several critical areas for improvement
within Stellar Pathways’ cybersecurity posture, primarily driven by
observable gaps in policy, training, and authentication controls.
Addressing these fundamental issues through the recommended actions will
significantly enhance the organization’s resilience against common cyber
threats and improve its overall security maturity. While this report
provides valuable insights based on available information, a more
complete and holistic picture requires additional technical data from
comprehensive network scans and existing vulnerability reports to fully
understand and mitigate all potential risks.</p>
