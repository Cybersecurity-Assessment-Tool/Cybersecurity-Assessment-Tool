<h1 id="executive-overview">Executive Overview</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of Brimstone
Manufacturing, based on a review of organizational data, security
questionnaire responses, and a recent network scan. The assessment
reveals several critical vulnerabilities and control gaps that warrant
immediate attention.</p>
<p>Key findings indicate a concerning lack of Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for email access and inadequate security awareness
training programs for employees. While a recent network scan on a
specific internal target (<code>192.168.0.5</code>) showed no open
ports, a pre-existing organizational risk concerning an unencrypted web
server suggests potential exposure on other systems or historical
configurations. Addressing these fundamental control weaknesses is
paramount to significantly enhancing Brimstone Manufacturing’s overall
cybersecurity resilience and reducing its attack surface.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>

<p>The "No" responses to MFA for email and both security awareness

organization’s risk profile.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on the target
<code>192.168.0.5</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not provided in input data</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Target:</strong> <code>192.168.0.5</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> Up</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports Detected:</strong> None</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The scan on <code>192.168.0.5</code> identified that the host was
online but found no open ports. Specifically, port 80 was reported as
<code>closed</code>. This indicates a minimal direct attack surface from
this specific IP address at the time of the scan.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of security questionnaire responses, technical
scan results, and pre-existing organizational risks, the following
issues have been identified:</p>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of MFA for Email Access</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Multi-Factor Authentication is not
required for accessing organizational email accounts. This significantly
increases the risk of account compromise through phishing, credential

</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Insufficient New Employee Security
Training</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">New employees are not receiving formal
security awareness training upon onboarding. This omission leads to a
higher likelihood of human-factor vulnerabilities, as new staff may not
be aware of organizational security policies, common threat vectors, or
best practices from the outset.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Insufficient Annual Security Training</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Employees do not receive mandatory annual
security awareness training. This results in a decaying understanding of
current threats, evolving attack techniques, and critical security best
practices over time, leaving the workforce susceptible to novel social
engineering attacks and malware.</td>

Risk)</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">An existing organizational vulnerability
report indicates an unencrypted web server (Port 80) is open,
potentially exposing sensitive traffic or outdated services. <em>Note: A
recent scan on <code>192.168.0.5</code> found Port 80 closed. This
pre-existing risk may pertain to a different system, an internal service
not externally scanned, or a historical configuration, and requires
further verification and remediation if still active.</em></td>

</div>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To significantly improve Brimstone Manufacturing’s cybersecurity
posture, the following actionable recommendations are provided,
prioritized by severity:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email
Accounts:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediately enforce mandatory MFA for
all organizational email accounts. This should be a top
priority.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Drastically reduces the risk of account
takeover even if passwords are compromised, protecting against phishing
and credential stuffing attacks.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Comprehensive Security Awareness Training
Programs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action (New Employees):</strong> Develop and implement a
mandatory security awareness training program for all new employees as
part of their onboarding process.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action (Annual Training):</strong> Conduct mandatory
annual security awareness training for all employees. Training content
should be updated regularly to cover emerging threats (e.g., advanced
phishing, ransomware, social engineering).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Cultivates a security-aware culture,
empowers employees to identify and report threats, and reduces the
likelihood of human-error-induced breaches.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Investigate and Remediate Unencrypted Web Server
Risk:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Conduct an internal audit to verify the
current status and location of any "Unencrypted Web Server" identified
in previous risk assessments. Determine if it’s the target
<code>192.168.0.5</code> (which currently shows port 80 closed) or
another system.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> If such a server is found and deemed
necessary, ensure it is properly secured by implementing SSL/TLS
encryption (HTTPS) for all traffic. If the server is no longer needed,
decommission it securely.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Prevents eavesdropping on sensitive
data, enhances data integrity, and improves compliance with modern
security standards. Update the risk register upon remediation.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Regular Security Audits and Vulnerability
Assessments:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Implement a schedule for regular
internal and external vulnerability scanning and penetration
testing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Proactively identifies new security
weaknesses, misconfigurations, and outdated software versions before
they can be exploited by attackers.</p></li>
</ul></li>
