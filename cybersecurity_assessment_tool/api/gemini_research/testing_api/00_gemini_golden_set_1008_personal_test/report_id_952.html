<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This document presents a cybersecurity assessment for <strong>Apex
Legends Group</strong>. The assessment is based on three primary data
inputs: organizational security questionnaire responses, network scan
results for the internal IP <code>192.168.1.100</code>, and a review of
reported pre-existing vulnerabilities. The objective is to analyze the
current security posture, identify potential risks, and provide
actionable recommendations to enhance the overall security
landscape.</p>

</div>
<h2 id="key-observations-from-questionnaire">Key Observations from
Questionnaire</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Positive Controls:</strong> The organization has
implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and
sensitive data systems, possesses an acceptable use policy, and conducts
security awareness training for new employees. These are positive steps
towards a robust security posture.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Identified Gaps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA for Email (Critical):</strong> The lack of
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access is a significant
vulnerability. Email is a primary vector for phishing and account
compromise, and without MFA, a stolen password can lead directly to
unauthorized access to sensitive communications and systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Annual Security Awareness Training (High):</strong> While
new employees receive initial training, the absence of annual recurring
security awareness training for all employees leaves a critical gap. The
threat landscape evolves rapidly, and regular training is crucial to
keep all employees informed about the latest threats and best
practices.</p></li>
</ul></li>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on the target IP address
<code>192.168.1.100</code>. The provided scan metadata did not include a
specific scan date.</p>
<h2 id="nmap-scan-summary">Nmap Scan Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>192.168.1.100</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> The host was reported as
<code>up</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports:</strong> No open ports were identified during
the scan. All extraports were reported as closed.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This finding indicates a strong network perimeter for the specific
scanned host from the perspective of external services. No publicly
exposed services or open ports were detected that could immediately be
exploited.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following recommendations are provided to address the identified
risks and enhance the cybersecurity posture of <strong>Apex Legends
Group</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Access:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mandate Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all user accounts
accessing email. This significantly reduces the risk of account
compromise due to stolen or weak passwords.</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluate available MFA solutions compatible with the
organization’s email platform and deploy one that offers user-friendly
and robust security features (e.g., authenticator apps, hardware
tokens).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Annual Security Awareness
Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and implement a mandatory annual security awareness
training program for all employees.</p></li>
<li><p>The training should cover current threat landscapes, including
phishing, social engineering, password hygiene, data handling best
practices, and incident reporting procedures.</p></li>
<li><p>Regular refreshers ensure employees remain vigilant and informed
about evolving cyber threats.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Regular, Authenticated Vulnerability
Assessments:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>While the current basic port scan showed no open ports, this is
only a partial view. Regular, authenticated vulnerability scans and
penetration tests should be conducted on internal and external
assets.</p></li>
<li><p>These assessments should aim to identify misconfigurations,
outdated software, and potential vulnerabilities within operating
systems and applications that might not be detected by a basic
unauthenticated port scan.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Maintain Strong Existing Controls:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Continue to enforce MFA for computer logins and sensitive data
systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Regularly review and update the employee acceptable use policy to
reflect current organizational needs and legal requirements.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure initial security awareness training for new employees is
comprehensive and up-to-date.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p><strong>Apex Legends Group</strong> demonstrates several positive
security practices, including the use of MFA for critical internal
systems and an acceptable use policy. The network scan also indicated a
well-secured perimeter for the scanned host with no open ports. However,
the absence of MFA for email and a lack of recurring annual security
awareness training represent significant risks that could be exploited
by malicious actors. Addressing these key areas with the provided
recommendations will substantially improve the organization’s overall
cybersecurity resilience and reduce its attack surface.</p>
