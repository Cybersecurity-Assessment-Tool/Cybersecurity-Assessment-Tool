<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>This document presents the findings of a cybersecurity assessment
conducted for <strong>Ember Glow Hospitality</strong>. The assessment
involved a comprehensive review of organizational security controls
through a structured questionnaire, a targeted technical network scan,
and an analysis of pre-existing risk data. The objective is to provide a
holistic view of the current security posture and offer actionable
recommendations for enhancement.</p>
<p>The analysis identified critical gaps in foundational security
controls, specifically concerning multi-factor authentication for
sensitive systems, the absence of key security policies, and
insufficient new employee security awareness training. While the
technical scan on the specified target revealed no immediately
exploitable open ports, a significant discrepancy was noted with a
pre-existing risk related to an unencrypted web server. These findings
collectively indicate several areas requiring immediate attention to
significantly enhance the overall security posture of Ember Glow
Hospitality.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-questionnaire-gaps">Analysis of
Questionnaire Gaps</h2>
<p>The questionnaire revealed several significant security control
deficiencies that pose immediate risks:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> The absence of
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data systems
is a critical vulnerability. This significantly increases the risk of
unauthorized access to critical information in the event of compromised
credentials (e.g., via phishing).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> The lack
of an AUP means there are no formal, documented guidelines for employees
regarding the proper and secure use of organizational IT assets and
resources. This can lead to misuse, increased risk of data breaches, and
potential non-compliance with industry regulations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>New Employee Security Awareness Training:</strong> New
employees do not receive dedicated security awareness training. This
leaves new hires vulnerable to common social engineering attacks (e.g.,
phishing, pretexting) and unaware of organizational security policies
from the outset, posing an immediate and preventable risk.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on the target IP address
<code>192.168.0.5</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP:</strong> <code>192.168.0.5</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> N/A (Scan date not provided in
metadata)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Nmap scan indicated that the host <code>192.168.0.5</code> was
up. However, the scan did not identify any open ports. Specifically,
port 80 was reported as <strong>closed</strong>. No services, products,
or versions were identified as a result of this scan.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="discrepancy-with-pre-existing-risks">Discrepancy with Pre-existing
Risks</h2>
<p>It is crucial to highlight a significant discrepancy between the
current technical scan results and the pre-existing risk data. The
recent scan reported port 80 as <strong>closed</strong> on
<code>192.168.0.5</code>. Conversely, the pre-existing risk data
(detailed in Section <a href="#sec:risk_assessment"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:risk_assessment">5</a>)
includes a vulnerability named “Unencrypted Web Server” with the
overview “Port 80 is open.”. This contradiction suggests that either the
pre-existing risk information is outdated, pertains to a different asset
not covered by this scan, or the reported remediation for port 80 being
closed has not yet been reflected in the risk register. Further
investigation is strongly recommended to reconcile this discrepancy.</p>
<h1 id="sec:risk_assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes the identified security gaps from the
questionnaire, the findings from the technical scan, and pre-existing
vulnerabilities into a consolidated risk register. Each risk is
categorized by severity to help prioritize remediation efforts.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the assessment, the following actionable recommendations are
provided to enhance Ember Glow Hospitality’s cybersecurity posture,
categorized by area of impact.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="identity-and-access-management">5.1. Identity
and Access Management</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong>
Immediately deploy and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication for all
systems that contain or provide access to sensitive organizational data.
Prioritize systems based on data classification and potential impact of
compromise. This is a critical control to prevent unauthorized access
even if primary credentials are breached.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="policy-and-training">5.2. Policy and
Training</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a comprehensive AUP that clearly outlines
employee responsibilities for using company IT resources, data handling,
internet usage, and communication. Ensure all employees formally review
and acknowledge the policy annually, and integrate it into
onboarding.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Introduce Mandatory New Employee Security Awareness
Training:</strong> Establish mandatory security awareness training for
all new hires during their onboarding process. This training should
cover common cybersecurity threats (e.g., phishing, malware),
organizational security policies, best practices for secure computing,
and incident reporting procedures.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Review and Enhance Annual Security Awareness
Training:</strong> While annual training is currently conducted, review
its content to ensure it is current, engaging, and effectively covers
relevant emerging threats, recent policy updates, and
organization-specific security challenges. Consider varied formats and
regular refreshers.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="technical-controls-vulnerability-management">5.3. Technical Controls
&amp; Vulnerability Management</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Reconcile Discrepancy for Unencrypted Web Server
Risk:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Conduct an immediate investigation to understand why the
pre-existing risk states “Port 80 is open” when the recent scan shows it
as closed on <code>192.168.0.5</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>If the risk pertains to a different asset, update the risk
register to correctly associate the risk with the relevant
asset(s).</p></li>
<li><p>If port 80 on <code>192.168.0.5</code> was recently mitigated
(e.g., closed), ensure the risk register is updated to reflect its
current status and remediation.</p></li>
<li><p>If port 80 is intended to be open for specific purposes, ensure
that all traffic is securely redirected to HTTPS (Port 443) with a
valid, trusted SSL/TLS certificate, enforcing encrypted
communication.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Regular Network Vulnerability
Scanning:</strong> Establish a schedule for regular, automated network
vulnerability scanning (e.g., monthly or quarterly) to proactively
identify newly exposed services, insecure configurations, outdated
software versions, and other technical weaknesses across the IT
infrastructure.</p></li>
