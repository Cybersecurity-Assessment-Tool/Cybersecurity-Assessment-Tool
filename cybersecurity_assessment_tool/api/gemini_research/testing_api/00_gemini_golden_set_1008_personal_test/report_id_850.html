<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive assessment of the cybersecurity
posture for <strong>Summit Peak Partners</strong>. The analysis is based
on a review of organizational security controls, an external network
scan, and an evaluation of existing risk data.</p>
<p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of
security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for sensitive
data systems. However, critical gaps were identified in several key
areas. Specifically, the absence of MFA for email and computer logins, a
lack of an employee acceptable use policy, and insufficient annual
security awareness training for all employees represent significant
vulnerabilities that could be exploited by adversaries.</p>
<p>The external network scan of <code>58.147.112.98</code> did not
reveal any open ports, suggesting a robust external perimeter or that
services are not exposed publicly on standard ports. While this is a
positive finding, it’s crucial to acknowledge that an empty target in
the scan metadata means the specific scope for external scanning was not
fully defined or the scan didn’t complete for that particular
target.</p>
<p>Overall, <strong>Summit Peak Partners</strong> has established some
security controls, but there are high-priority areas requiring immediate
attention to significantly reduce the attack surface and enhance overall
resilience against cyber threats. The recommendations provided in this
report aim to guide the organization in strengthening its security
framework.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed to identify publicly
accessible services and potential vulnerabilities.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Target:</strong> (Target was unspecified in the scan
metadata)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> No scan date specified.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="scan-findings">Scan Findings</h2>
<p>The provided scan data for target indicates that no open ports were
identified, or the target was unreachable/unspecified for a detailed
scan. This means no external services were found to be openly exposed on
common ports from this scan’s perspective. It is important to ensure
that critical services are not unintentionally exposed and that regular
external scans are performed with a clearly defined target scope.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the security control review and technical findings, the
following risks have been identified. These risks primarily stem from
gaps in foundational security practices.</p>

<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of MFA for Computer Logins</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Failure to implement MFA for computer
logins significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to
endpoints, facilitating lateral movement within the network and
potential data breaches if credentials are stolen.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">No Acceptable Use Policy</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The absence of an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP) leaves the organization vulnerable to employee misuse of IT
resources, data leakage, and compliance issues, as expectations for
proper conduct are not formally documented.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Insufficient Annual Security Training</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Without annual security awareness training
for all employees, the workforce remains susceptible to evolving social
engineering tactics and may not be aware of current threats and best
practices, making them a weak link in the security chain.</td>
