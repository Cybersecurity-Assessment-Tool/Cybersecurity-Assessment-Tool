<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive assessment of <strong>Iron River
Finance</strong>’s current cybersecurity posture. The analysis is based
on self-reported organizational data, a network scan of a specified
internal target (), and existing risk documentation.</p>
<p>The organization demonstrates positive security practices by
implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer
logins. However, critical gaps were identified concerning the absence of
MFA for sensitive data systems and a lack of comprehensive security
awareness training programs for both new and existing employees.</p>
<p>The network scan of the specified internal target () is a positive
finding, as it did not reveal any open ports, indicating a restricted
network exposure for this particular host. This finding, however,
introduces a crucial discrepancy with a pre-existing risk documented as
an “Unencrypted Web Server” on Port 80. This contradiction requires
immediate investigation to ascertain the current state and applicability
of the identified risk.</p>
<p>Overall, while some foundational controls are in place, the
organization faces significant risks related to human factors and
sensitive data access, alongside a need to reconcile conflicting
technical security information.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">3. Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was conducted on the internal target to identify
exposed services and potential vulnerabilities.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target Scanned:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not provided (Report generated on
2026-01-27)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Used:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="scan-findings">Scan Findings</h2>
<p>The Nmap scan of reported that the host was ‘up‘, indicating it was
responsive on the network. However, the scan did not detect any open
ports. Specifically, port 80 was identified as ‘closed‘. This indicates
a positive security posture for this specific host, as no common
services appear to be directly exposed to the network from this
scan.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="discrepancy-with-pre-existing-risk-data">Discrepancy with
Pre-existing Risk Data</h2>
<p>It is crucial to highlight a significant discrepancy between this
current scan finding and a pre-existing risk identified in the
organization’s vulnerability data (Input 3). The pre-existing risk,
“Unencrypted Web Server” (assigned a severity of 5.0), explicitly states
that “Port 80 is open.” In direct contrast, the current Nmap scan found
port 80 to be ‘closed‘ on the target .</p>
<p>This discrepancy could imply several scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The pre-existing risk refers to a different system or IP address
within the organization that was not included in this particular
scan.</p></li>
<li><p>The pre-existing risk is outdated, and port 80 on the relevant
system has since been closed or secured.</p></li>
<li><p>The current scan, while useful, might have been too narrow or
incomplete to detect the service if it operates on an uncommon port or
is protected by other network controls.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Further investigation is strongly recommended to clarify this
contradiction and confirm the true current status of all web servers and
services within the organization.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">5. Recommendations</h1>
<p>To enhance <strong>Iron River Finance</strong>’s cybersecurity
posture and mitigate the identified risks, the following actionable
recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong>
Immediately deploy and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication for all
systems that store, process, or transmit sensitive organizational or
customer data. This is a critical control to prevent unauthorized
access, even if primary credentials are compromised.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish New Employee Security Awareness
Training:</strong> Develop and implement a mandatory security awareness
training program for all new employees during their onboarding process.
This training should cover fundamental cybersecurity principles, common
threats (e.g., phishing, social engineering, malware), and
organizational security policies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Annual Security Awareness Training:</strong>
Institute a mandatory, comprehensive, and up-to-date security awareness
training program for all employees at least once per year. Regular
training is vital to reinforce secure behaviors and educate employees on
evolving threat landscapes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Investigate Port 80 Discrepancy:</strong> Conduct a
thorough investigation into the “Unencrypted Web Server” risk and its
contradiction with the latest network scan results.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Determine if the pre-existing risk refers to a different system
or IP address within the organization not covered by the scan.</p></li>
<li><p>If the risk is indeed associated with , verify if port 80 has
been definitively closed or otherwise secured since the risk was
initially identified.</p></li>
<li><p>If a web server is intended to be accessible, ensure it uses
HTTPS/TLS encryption, is configured securely, and only exposes necessary
ports.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Vulnerability Scanning and Penetration
Testing:</strong> Implement a consistent schedule for regular internal
and external vulnerability scans, complemented by periodic penetration
tests. This proactive approach will help identify and address security
weaknesses before they can be exploited.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Maintain Comprehensive Asset Inventory:</strong> Develop
and maintain an accurate and up-to-date inventory of all IT assets
(hardware, software, network devices), including their purpose,
location, and assigned owners. This ensures complete visibility and
comprehensive security coverage.</p></li>
