<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a cybersecurity posture assessment for Fable
&amp; Lore, based on organizational data, a recent network scan, and an
overview of pre-existing risks. The assessment highlights key strengths,
identified vulnerabilities, and areas for improvement.</p>
<p>Overall, Fable &amp; Lore demonstrates a foundational commitment to
security, particularly in implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
for computer logins and sensitive data systems, and conducting regular
security awareness training. However, critical gaps were identified
concerning the absence of MFA for email access and a formal employee
acceptable use policy, posing significant risks.</p>
<p>The network scan of revealed positive findings, specifically that TCP
port 80 (typically used for unencrypted web traffic) is currently
closed. This suggests a potential successful remediation of the
"Unencrypted Web Server" risk identified in the organization’s
pre-existing vulnerability list, or that the previous risk pertained to
a different asset. Despite this positive technical finding, the lack of
MFA for email and a formal AUP remain pressing concerns requiring
immediate attention.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-questionnaire-gaps">Analysis of
Questionnaire Gaps</h2>
<p>The review highlights two significant gaps in security controls:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Email Access:</strong> Not requiring MFA
for email access is a critical vulnerability. Email is a primary vector
for phishing, business email compromise (BEC), and account takeover
attacks. Without MFA, compromised credentials can grant attackers full
access to an employee’s inbox, leading to data breaches, further
compromise of systems, and financial fraud.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong>
The lack of an AUP means there are no formal guidelines for employees
regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources. This can lead to
misuse of systems, increased risk of malware infections, data
exfiltration, and legal/compliance issues due to undefined expectations
for employee conduct.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was conducted on 2026-01-26 targeting the host .</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="scan-details">Scan Details</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target Host:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> 2026-01-26</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Used:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="host-status-and-open-ports">Host Status and

<p>The scan identified the host as ‘up‘.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 80 (HTTP):</strong> State:
<code>closed</code></p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of
Technical Findings</h3>
<p>The finding that TCP port 80 is ‘closed‘ on the scanned target is a
positive security posture indicator. This suggests that no unencrypted
web services are directly exposed on this specific host, which is
beneficial for reducing the attack surface.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following recommendations are provided to address the identified
risks and enhance Fable &amp; Lore’s cybersecurity posture.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="immediate-actions-high-priority">Immediate
Actions (High Priority)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Access:</strong> Mandate
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts across the
organization. This is a critical control to prevent unauthorized access
even if passwords are stolen.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a comprehensive AUP outlining the proper use of
organizational IT assets, including internet, email, software, and
hardware. Distribute it to all employees, obtain signed
acknowledgements, and integrate it into onboarding processes.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="medium-to-long-term-actions">Medium to
Long-Term Actions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Verify Remediation of Unencrypted Web Server
Risk:</strong> Although the recent scan found Port 80 closed on ,
thoroughly investigate the "Unencrypted Web Server" pre-existing risk.
Confirm if this vulnerability has been fully remediated across all
relevant assets or if it pertains to a different scope. If any
unencrypted web services are still required, ensure they are secured
with SSL/TLS (HTTPS) and appropriate access controls.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Policy Review and Updates:</strong> Periodically
review and update all security policies, including the AUP, to ensure
they remain relevant with evolving threats and technologies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Advanced Security Awareness Training:</strong> While
current training is in place, consider incorporating more advanced
topics, simulated phishing exercises, and role-specific training to
further enhance employee resilience against cyber threats.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These recommendations, when implemented, will significantly
strengthen Fable &amp; Lore’s defenses against common cyber threats and
foster a more robust security environment.</p>
