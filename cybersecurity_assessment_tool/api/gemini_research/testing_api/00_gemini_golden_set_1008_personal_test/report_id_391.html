<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This report presents a comprehensive cybersecurity assessment for
<strong>Silver Leaf Collective</strong>. The assessment involved an
analysis of organizational security practices based on a questionnaire,
a review of network scan data, and an evaluation of current risks. The
objective is to identify critical security gaps, assess technical
vulnerabilities, and provide actionable recommendations to enhance the
overall security posture and protect against evolving cyber threats.</p>
<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p><strong>Silver Leaf Collective</strong>’s current cybersecurity
posture reveals several critical areas requiring immediate attention,
primarily concerning the widespread absence of Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins. These MFA gaps
represent significant risks that could lead to unauthorized access,
credential compromise, and potential data breaches. Additionally, the
lack of dedicated security awareness training for new employees creates
a vulnerability to social engineering attacks such as phishing. While a
basic network scan identified an open SSH port, further information
regarding service versions and configurations is needed for a complete
technical risk assessment. This report outlines these key findings,
categorizes associated risks, and provides targeted recommendations to
strengthen the organization’s defenses against common cyber threats.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on the target <code>2001:db8::1</code>.
The scan identified the following open ports and services. It is
important to note that without more detailed service versioning
information, the full extent of potential vulnerabilities associated
with the identified service cannot be accurately assessed.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Target:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> <em>Not specified in scan
data.</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports and Services:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 22 (TCP):</strong> Open</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Service:</strong> SSH (Secure Shell)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Product/Version:</strong> <em>Not identified by
scan.</em></p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The presence of an open SSH port, especially if exposed externally,
requires robust security measures. Without specific version information,
it is not possible to determine if the SSH daemon is running an outdated
or vulnerable version. This lack of information prevents a definitive
assessment of the service’s security posture.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of security controls from the questionnaire and
the findings from the technical scan, the following cybersecurity risks
have been identified:</p>

<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for
Email Access</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Without MFA, email accounts are highly
susceptible to credential stuffing, phishing, and brute-force attacks.

<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for
Computer Logins</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Absence of MFA on computer logins
significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to endpoints. If
credentials are stolen or guessed, attackers can gain direct access to
internal systems, potentially escalating privileges and moving laterally
across the network.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Inadequate Security Awareness Training for
New Employees</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">New employees are often a primary target
for social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) due to their
unfamiliarity with organizational security policies and common threat
vectors. Lack of initial training leaves them vulnerable and increases
the likelihood of human-error-induced security incidents.</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">Medium</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Open SSH Port (Lack of Version
Information)</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">An open SSH port (22), especially if
externally accessible, can be a target for brute-force attacks or
exploits. Without version information, it’s impossible to confirm if the
service is running a secure, up-to-date version, posing a potential
vulnerability.</td>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and enhance <strong>Silver Leaf
Collective</strong>’s cybersecurity posture, the following actionable
recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Broadly:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>High Priority:</strong> Mandate MFA for all email
accounts across the organization. This is a critical defense against
phishing, credential theft, and business email compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>High Priority:</strong> Implement MFA for all user logins
to computers, workstations, and internal systems. This significantly
reduces the risk of unauthorized access even if passwords are stolen or
compromised.</p></li>
<li><p>Explore extending MFA to other critical systems or applications
not currently covered, as part of a comprehensive identity and access
management strategy.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Enhance Security Awareness Training Program:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Medium Priority:</strong> Develop and implement a
mandatory security awareness training program specifically for all new
employees during their onboarding process. This training should cover
essential topics such as phishing identification, social engineering
tactics, strong password best practices, and procedures for reporting
suspicious activities.</p></li>
<li><p>Regularly update and reinforce existing annual security awareness
training to address emerging threats, new policies, and evolving attack
techniques.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Review and Secure Open Network Services:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Medium Priority:</strong> Conduct a detailed assessment
of the SSH service running on . This assessment should identify the
exact product and version of the SSH daemon.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure the SSH daemon is running the latest stable and patched
version to mitigate known vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement strong SSH security configurations, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Disabling password authentication in favor of more secure
key-based authentication.</p></li>
<li><p>Disabling direct root login via SSH.</p></li>
<li><p>Implementing rate limiting for failed login attempts to deter
brute-force attacks.</p></li>
<li><p>Restricting SSH access to known, trusted source IP addresses (if
external access is absolutely necessary).</p></li>
<li><p>Regularly review SSH access logs for any suspicious activity or
unauthorized connection attempts.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If the SSH service is not essential for external access, consider
restricting its exposure to the internal network only or removing it
entirely to reduce the attack surface.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Regular Vulnerability Management
Practices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement a routine vulnerability scanning and penetration
testing schedule for both external and internal assets to proactively
identify and remediate security weaknesses before they can be
exploited.</p></li>
<li><p>Develop and maintain a robust patch management program to ensure
all operating systems, applications, and network devices are kept
up-to-date with the latest security patches and configurations.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>This cybersecurity assessment has identified key vulnerabilities and
areas for improvement within <strong>Silver Leaf Collective</strong>’s
security posture. By prioritizing the immediate implementation of
Multi-Factor Authentication for email and computer logins, and by
enhancing the security awareness training program, the organization can
significantly reduce its exposure to common and impactful cyber threats.
Proactive management of network services, coupled with a steadfast
commitment to ongoing security practices and continuous monitoring, will
be crucial in building a resilient defense against the evolving threat
landscape and safeguarding organizational assets.</p>
