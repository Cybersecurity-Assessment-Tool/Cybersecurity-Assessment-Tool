<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings from a cybersecurity posture
assessment for Digital Drift, encompassing an organizational security
control review, technical network scan analysis, and correlation with
existing risk data. The assessment identified several critical security
gaps and discrepancies requiring immediate attention.</p>
<p>Key findings include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Critical Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Gaps:</strong>
MFA is not uniformly required for email access or computer logins,
significantly increasing the risk of account compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Insufficient Ongoing Security Awareness
Training:</strong> While new employees receive training, annual security
awareness training for all employees is not conducted, leaving the
organization vulnerable to evolving human-factor threats.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Exposed Sensitive Database Interface (Port
8080):</strong> A network scan revealed an open port 8080 on an internal
system (<code>10.5.5.5</code>) explicitly advertising "TOP SECRET DB".
This finding critically contradicts the organization’s current risk
assessment which incorrectly labels this port as "Secured" with zero
severity. This discrepancy represents a severe misconfiguration and a
significant blind spot, exposing highly sensitive information.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Immediate recommendations focus on implementing comprehensive MFA,
establishing mandatory annual security awareness training, and urgently
investigating/securing the service on port 8080, along with a full
re-evaluation of its security status.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>

<h2 id="analysis-of-control-gaps">Analysis of Control Gaps</h2>
<p>The questionnaire responses highlight critical gaps in the
organization’s security posture:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA Adoption:</strong> While MFA is used for sensitive
data systems, its absence for email and general computer logins
represents a severe vulnerability. These are common initial access
vectors for attackers, and without MFA, they are highly susceptible to
credential-based attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ongoing Security Training:</strong> The lack of annual
security awareness training for all employees is a significant
oversight. Cyber threats constantly evolve, and regular training is
essential to keep employees informed and resilient against phishing,
social engineering, and other attack vectors.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed to identify open ports and services on
specified targets.</p>
<h2 id="target">Target: </h2>
<p>The following relevant findings were identified during the scan:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 8080 (TCP):</strong> Open</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Service/Product:</strong> HTTP (implied by http-title
script)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>HTTP Title:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Analysis:</strong> This finding is highly critical. The
service on port 8080 explicitly advertises itself as "TOP SECRET DB" via
its HTTP title. This strongly indicates a sensitive database interface
is exposed, potentially over an unencrypted or easily accessible
protocol. This contradicts existing organizational information that
labels Port 8080 as "Secured" with a severity of 0.0. This discrepancy
suggests a severe misconfiguration or a critical lack of awareness
regarding the system’s current exposure and sensitivity.</p></li>

<h2 id="existing-risks-re-evaluation-required">Existing Risks
(Re-evaluation Required)</h2>
<p>The provided existing risk data included one entry:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Risk Name:</strong> Port 8080 Secured</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Overview:</strong> Port 8080 is confirmed secure and
false positive.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Severity:</strong> 0.0 (CVSS)</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> As highlighted in the Technical Scan Results
and Risk Assessment, the network scan explicitly identified port 8080 on
displaying "TOP SECRET DB". This directly contradicts the "Port 8080
Secured" assessment. This existing risk entry requires immediate and
thorough re-evaluation, as the current technical findings indicate it is
severely miscategorized and poses a critical threat. The organization’s
internal risk register should be updated to reflect the actual state of
exposure and its associated critical severity.</p>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actionable recommendations are provided to address the
identified risks and improve Digital Drift’s cybersecurity posture:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Extend mandatory MFA requirements to all corporate email
accounts.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement mandatory MFA for all computer logins across the
organization.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure MFA policies are consistently enforced across all access
points.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Comprehensive Annual Security Awareness
Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and implement a mandatory annual security awareness
training program for all employees.</p></li>
<li><p>The training should cover current threat landscapes, phishing,
social engineering, password hygiene, and data handling best
practices.</p></li>
<li><p>Regularly update training content to reflect new and emerging
threats.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Immediately Investigate and Secure Exposed Sensitive
Database Interface (Port 8080):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Urgently investigate the service running on port 8080 on
.</p></li>
<li><p>Determine the nature and sensitivity of the data accessible via
this service.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement immediate remediation steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Restrict network access to this port to only authorized,
internal, and necessary systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement strong authentication and authorization
controls.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all traffic to and from this service is encrypted (e.g.,
migrate to HTTPS if applicable).</p></li>
<li><p>If the service is not intended for external or broad internal
access, it should be removed or moved behind multiple layers of security
(e.g., VPN, firewalls, reverse proxies).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Conduct a full re-evaluation of the security status of port 8080
and update the internal risk register to accurately reflect its critical
severity and the implemented controls.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Review and Update Risk Register Processes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Establish a process for regularly reconciling internal risk
assessments with external vulnerability scans and penetration test
results to identify and correct discrepancies.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure that risk owners are clearly identified and that
remediation plans are tracked and validated.</p></li>
