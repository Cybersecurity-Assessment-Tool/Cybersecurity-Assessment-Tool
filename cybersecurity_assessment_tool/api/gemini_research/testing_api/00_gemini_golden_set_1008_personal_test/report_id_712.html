<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for Crestview Analytics, drawing insights from a recent network scan, a
detailed organizational security questionnaire, and a review of any
existing identified risks.</p>
<p>A key positive finding from the external network scan is the absence
of any open ports on the target host, significantly reducing the
immediate external attack surface. This indicates a well-configured
perimeter from a basic port scanning perspective.</p>
<p>However, a critical governance and compliance gap was identified: the
organization currently lacks an Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP).
This fundamental policy is essential for establishing clear guidelines
for employee conduct regarding company IT assets, data, and internet
usage, and its absence poses a notable risk.</p>
<p>No pre-existing vulnerabilities or specific technical
misconfigurations were identified from the provided data.
Recommendations are provided to address the identified policy gap and
further enhance Crestview Analytics’ overall security posture.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-responses">Analysis of Responses</h2>
<p>Crestview Analytics demonstrates a strong commitment to multi-factor
authentication (MFA), requiring it for email, computer logins, and
sensitive data systems. This significantly enhances protection against
unauthorized access via compromised credentials. The organization also
maintains regular security awareness training programs for both new and
existing employees, which is crucial for fostering a security-conscious
culture.</p>
<p>However, a critical gap was identified: the absence of an Employee
Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). An AUP is a foundational document that
outlines the appropriate and acceptable use of company assets,
information systems, and networks. Its absence can lead to confusion
regarding employee responsibilities, increased risk of misuse of
resources, and potential legal and compliance issues.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An Nmap network scan was performed to assess the external network
posture of a specified target.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Used:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>192.168.1.100</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not available in provided
metadata.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> Up</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports Found:</strong> None</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Extra Ports State:</strong> Closed</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of Technical
Findings</h2>
<p>The Nmap scan against <code>192.168.1.100</code> indicated that the
host was operational ("up") but revealed no open ports. Furthermore, the
‘extraports_state‘ was reported as "closed," implying that all scanned
ports were either closed or filtered. This is a positive security
finding, as it suggests a minimal attack surface from an external
network perspective. With no open ports, there are no directly exposed
services, products, or versions that could be exploited through common
network vulnerabilities. This indicates a well-secured perimeter from
the perspective of basic port scanning.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the provided data, the following significant
risk has been identified:</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risk and further strengthen Crestview
Analytics’ cybersecurity posture, the following recommendation is
provided:</p>
<h2
id="recommendation-1-develop-and-implement-a-comprehensive-employee-acceptable-use-policy-aup">Recommendation
1: Develop and Implement a Comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Description:</strong> Create and formally implement a
written Acceptable Use Policy that clearly outlines the expected and
prohibited behaviors for employees regarding the use of all
company-owned or controlled IT assets, networks, systems, and
data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> An AUP is a fundamental component
of an organization’s security governance framework. It sets clear
boundaries, communicates employee responsibilities, reduces the risk of
unintentional policy violations, and provides a basis for disciplinary
action if policies are breached. This policy enhances overall security
by mitigating risks associated with human error, insider threats, and
compliance failures.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action Steps:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Form a Policy Development Team:</strong> Assemble a
cross-functional team including representatives from IT, HR, and Legal
departments to draft the AUP.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Define Scope and Content:</strong> The policy should
cover, but not be limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Use of company computers, networks, internet, and email.</p></li>
<li><p>Data handling procedures, including classification, storage, and
sharing.</p></li>
<li><p>Prohibited activities (e.g., illegal content, unauthorized
software installation, harassment).</p></li>
<li><p>Password management guidelines.</p></li>
<li><p>Incident reporting procedures.</p></li>
<li><p>Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policies, if applicable.</p></li>
<li><p>Consequences of policy violations.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Legal Review and Management Approval:</strong> Ensure the
AUP is reviewed by legal counsel to ensure compliance with relevant laws
and regulations, and obtain formal approval from senior
management.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Communication and Acknowledgment:</strong> Distribute the
approved AUP to all employees. Conduct mandatory training to explain the
policy and require all employees to acknowledge that they have read,
understood, and agree to abide by its terms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Review and Updates:</strong> Establish a process
for periodically reviewing (e.g., annually) and updating the AUP to
ensure it remains relevant with technological changes and evolving
regulatory landscapes.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> Critical</p></li>
