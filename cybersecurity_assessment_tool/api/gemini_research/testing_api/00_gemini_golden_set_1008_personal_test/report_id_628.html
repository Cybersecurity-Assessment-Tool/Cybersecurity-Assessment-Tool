<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of <strong>Radiant
Life</strong> based on an analysis of provided network scan data,
organizational security questionnaire responses, and existing risk
information. The assessment reveals a mix of strong technical controls
in certain areas and significant gaps in security policies, awareness
training, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) implementation.</p>
<p>While the provided network scan for the internal target
<code>192.168.1.100</code> indicated no open ports, which is a positive
sign for host hardening, the organizational data highlights critical
deficiencies. Specifically, the absence of MFA for computer logins and
sensitive data systems, along with a lack of fundamental security
policies and awareness training, presents substantial risks. These gaps
expose the organization to common attack vectors such as phishing,
credential compromise, and insider threats. Immediate attention to the
identified risks and implementation of the recommended controls is
crucial to elevate the overall security posture and reduce the
likelihood of a successful cyber attack.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are provided to
enhance <strong>Radiant Life</strong>’s cybersecurity posture:</p>
<h2 id="immediate-actions-critical-gaps">Immediate Actions (Critical
Gaps)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>For Computer Logins:</strong> Immediately deploy and
enforce MFA for all employee computer logins. This significantly reduces
the risk of unauthorized access even if passwords are stolen.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>For Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> Implement MFA for
access to all systems containing or processing sensitive organizational
data. Prioritize systems with the highest impact in case of
compromise.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="policy-and-training-enhancements-high-priority">Policy and
Training Enhancements (High Priority)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create a clear and comprehensive AUP outlining employee
responsibilities, prohibited activities, and consequences for
non-compliance regarding IT systems and data.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all employees review and acknowledge the AUP
annually.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Robust Security Awareness Training
Programs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>New Employee Training:</strong> Institute mandatory
security awareness training as part of the onboarding process for all
new employees. This should cover common threats, policies, and incident
reporting.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Annual All-Employee Training:</strong> Conduct mandatory,
engaging, and relevant security awareness training for all employees at
least once per year. This should include phishing simulations, password
hygiene, and data handling best practices.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="general-security-best-practices">General Security Best
Practices</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Regular Network Scans:</strong> Continuously monitor
internal and external networks for open ports, unauthorized services,
and misconfigurations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Patch Management:</strong> Ensure all operating systems,
applications, and network devices are kept up-to-date with the latest
security patches to mitigate known vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Incident Response Plan:</strong> Develop and regularly
test an incident response plan to effectively detect, contain,
eradicate, and recover from security incidents.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Backups:</strong> Implement a robust backup
strategy, including offsite and immutable backups, to ensure business
continuity in case of data loss or ransomware attacks.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These recommendations, when implemented, will significantly
strengthen <strong>Radiant Life</strong>’s defense against cyber threats
and improve its overall security posture.</p>
