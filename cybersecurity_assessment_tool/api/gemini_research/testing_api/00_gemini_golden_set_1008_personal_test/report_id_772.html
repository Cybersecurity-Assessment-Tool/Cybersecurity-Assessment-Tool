<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for , synthesizing findings from an organizational security
questionnaire, a network vulnerability scan, and a review of existing
risks. The assessment reveals several critical areas for improvement,
primarily in the realm of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
implementation for computer logins and the establishment of robust
security awareness training programs. While the external network scan
did not identify any immediate open ports or services, the internal
control gaps present significant risks to the organization’s overall
security. Implementing the recommended actions will substantially
enhance ’s defense against common cyber threats.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was conducted against the target host . The scan aimed
to identify open ports, running services, and potential
vulnerabilities.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> The target host was found to be
<code>up</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports and Services:</strong> No open ports or
services were identified during the scan. All observed ports were
reported as <code>closed</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>The lack of identified open ports is a positive finding, suggesting
that the host may be well-hardened against external access or protected
by an effective firewall. However, this scan does not assess internal
vulnerabilities or misconfigurations. It is important to note that a
lack of open ports on a single scan does not guarantee complete
security, as services might operate on non-standard ports or only be
accessible from specific internal network segments.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the organizational data and the network
scan, the following risks have been identified. The pre-existing
vulnerabilities list was empty, indicating no known, documented risks
within the provided data.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and enhance ’s cybersecurity
posture, the following recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer
Logins:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Deploy and enforce MFA for all employee and administrative
computer logins. This adds a crucial layer of security, making it
significantly harder for unauthorized users to gain access even if
passwords are compromised.</p></li>
<li><p>Research and select an MFA solution compatible with existing
infrastructure (e.g., Active Directory, cloud identity
providers).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Mandatory Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and implement a comprehensive security awareness training
program that all new employees must complete during their onboarding
process.</p></li>
<li><p>Training should cover topics such as phishing, social
engineering, password hygiene, identifying suspicious emails, and proper
data handling.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Annual Security Awareness Training for All
Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mandate annual (or more frequent) security awareness training
refresher courses for all existing employees.</p></li>
<li><p>These sessions should update employees on new and evolving
threats, reinforce best practices, and include interactive elements like
simulated phishing campaigns.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Consider Periodic Vulnerability Scanning:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>While the initial scan showed no open ports, consider
implementing regular, authenticated internal and external vulnerability
scans. This helps to identify misconfigurations, outdated software, and
potential security weaknesses within the internal network and any
services that may become exposed over time.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>has a foundational level of security controls in place, evidenced by
MFA for email and sensitive data, and an acceptable use policy. However,
the identified gaps in MFA for computer logins and, critically, the
complete absence of security awareness training programs for both new
and existing employees, pose significant and immediate risks. Addressing
these deficiencies through the proposed recommendations will
significantly strengthen the organization’s overall security posture,
reduce the likelihood of successful cyberattacks, and protect valuable
organizational assets.</p>
