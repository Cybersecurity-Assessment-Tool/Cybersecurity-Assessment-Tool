<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings from an initial cybersecurity
posture assessment for Green Sprout Organic. The analysis involved
correlating organizational data, security questionnaire responses, and
technical network scan results. The assessment reveals significant
deficiencies across the organization’s security posture, encompassing
critical gaps in foundational security controls and exposed technical
vulnerabilities. Key findings include a widespread lack of Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for critical services like email, the absence of an
Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), and a complete dearth of security awareness
training for employees. Furthermore, a network scan identified an
End-of-Life (EoL) web server running an outdated version of Nginx and an
SSL certificate mismatch, posing immediate technical risks. Addressing
these issues with urgency is paramount to bolster Green Sprout Organic’s
defenses against common cyber threats.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-questionnaire-results">Analysis
of Questionnaire Results</h2>
<p>The questionnaire results reveal significant vulnerabilities related
to human factors and foundational policy.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Critical Gap: MFA for Email Access.</strong> The absence
of MFA for email significantly increases the risk of account compromise
through phishing or credential stuffing attacks, potentially leading to
business email compromise (BEC) and unauthorized access to sensitive
communications.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Critical Gap: Acceptable Use Policy (AUP).</strong>
Without an AUP, employees lack clear guidelines on the appropriate use
of company IT resources, increasing the likelihood of misuse, data
leakage, and non-compliance with security best practices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Critical Gap: Security Awareness Training.</strong> The
complete lack of security awareness training for both new and existing
employees leaves the organization highly susceptible to social
engineering attacks, phishing, malware infections, and other
human-factor vulnerabilities.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was conducted on the target system . The scan date was
<code>2025-11-22T10:00:00Z</code>.</p>
<h2 id="identified-open-ports-and-services">Identified Open Ports and
Services</h2>
<p>The following open ports and services were identified:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port:</strong> 443/TCP</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>State:</strong> Open</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Service:</strong> HTTPS</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Product:</strong> Nginx</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.18.0</p></li>
<li><p><strong>SSL Certificate Details:</strong> The SSL certificate
presented by the server has a common name (CN) of
<code>www.acme-corp.com</code>.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of
Technical Findings</h2>
<p>The technical scan revealed two critical vulnerabilities:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>End-of-Life (EoL) Web Server:</strong> Nginx version
1.18.0 was released in April 2020 and is an End-of-Life stable branch.
It no longer receives security updates or bug fixes. This exposes the
server to numerous known and unpatched vulnerabilities, making it a
high-risk target for exploitation. Attackers could leverage these
vulnerabilities for remote code execution, denial-of-service, or other
forms of system compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>SSL Certificate Mismatch:</strong> The server at is
presenting an SSL certificate issued for <code>www.acme-corp.com</code>.
This common name does not match the organization’s stated website domain
(<code>www.GreenSproutOrganic.net</code>). This mismatch raises
significant trust concerns, will trigger security warnings in web
browsers for users attempting to connect, and indicates either a severe
misconfiguration or potentially that the server is not intended to host
Green Sprout Organic’s services. If it is intended to host Green Sprout
Organic’s services, it undermines the integrity and confidentiality of
communications.</p></li>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and improve Green Sprout Organic’s
overall cybersecurity posture, the following recommendations are
provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
Email:</strong> Immediately enable and enforce MFA for all
organizational email accounts. This is a critical control to prevent
unauthorized access even if credentials are stolen.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade and Patch Web Server:</strong> Prioritize
upgrading the Nginx web server on to a currently supported and stable
version (e.g., Nginx 1.24.x or 1.26.x). Establish a regular patching
schedule to ensure all software is kept up-to-date.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Resolve SSL Certificate Mismatch:</strong> Investigate
the server at . If it is intended to host
<code>www.GreenSproutOrganic.net</code>, obtain and install a valid
SSL/TLS certificate issued for <code>www.GreenSproutOrganic.net</code>.
If it is not intended for this purpose, ensure it is properly configured
or decommissioned.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a comprehensive AUP that clearly outlines
employee responsibilities for using company IT resources. Ensure all
employees review and acknowledge this policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish a Robust Security Awareness Training
Program:</strong> Implement mandatory security awareness training for
all new employees during onboarding. Conduct annual refresher training
for all employees, covering topics such as phishing, social engineering,
password hygiene, and data handling.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Vulnerability Scanning and Penetration
Testing:</strong> Institute a program for regular internal and external
vulnerability scanning to proactively identify new technical weaknesses.
Consider engaging a third party for periodic penetration testing to
simulate real-world attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Incident Response Planning:</strong> Develop and document
an incident response plan to ensure the organization can effectively
detect, respond to, and recover from cybersecurity incidents.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Green Sprout Organic currently faces significant cybersecurity risks
due to critical gaps in both technical controls and organizational
policies. The combination of End-of-Life software, an SSL certificate
mismatch, and foundational weaknesses in MFA, AUP, and security
awareness training presents a substantial attack surface. Addressing
these vulnerabilities through the recommended actions is crucial for
improving the organization’s resilience against cyber threats and
protecting its assets and reputation.</p>
