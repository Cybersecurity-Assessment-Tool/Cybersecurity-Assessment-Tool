<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of <strong>Moxie
Marketing</strong> based on provided organizational data and a security
questionnaire. Due to issues with the provided data, detailed technical
network scan results and pre-existing vulnerability lists could not be
incorporated into this assessment. The analysis primarily highlights
critical security control gaps identified through the questionnaire,
particularly concerning Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and initial
employee security awareness training. While some foundational controls
like an Acceptable Use Policy are in place, significant areas require
immediate attention to reduce exposure to common cyber threats.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>

<h2 id="analysis-of-questionnaire-findings">Analysis of Questionnaire
Findings</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Critical Gap:</strong> MFA is not required for email
access (SC-01) or for logging into computers (SC-02). This significantly
increases the risk of account compromise through phishing or brute-force
attacks, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, system
control, or business email compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Positive Control:</strong> MFA is used for sensitive data
systems (SC-03), which is a good practice.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Security Awareness Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Critical Gap:</strong> Security awareness training is not
mandatory for new employees during onboarding (SC-05). New hires are
often prime targets for social engineering due to unfamiliarity with
organizational policies and common threats, posing an immediate
risk.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Positive Control:</strong> Annual security awareness
training is conducted for all employees (SC-06), which helps maintain a
baseline level of awareness.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Positive Control:</strong> An employee acceptable use
policy is in place (SC-04), providing a framework for responsible
technology use.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<h2 id="network-scan-findings">Network Scan Findings</h2>
<p>No actionable network scan data was provided for analysis. The input
indicated a broken data structure for scan metadata and results.
Therefore, no open ports, services, products, or versions could be
identified or evaluated for vulnerabilities. The target IP for this
missing scan would have been <code>[Target IP]</code>.</p>
<h2 id="impact-of-missing-technical-data">Impact of Missing Technical
Data</h2>
<p>The absence of network scan data severely limits the ability to
perform a comprehensive technical vulnerability assessment. It prevents
the identification of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Exposed services and their configurations.</p></li>
<li><p>Outdated software versions with known vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p>Misconfigurations or default credentials that could be
exploited.</p></li>
<li><p>Network-level attack surface details.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A dedicated network vulnerability scan is strongly recommended to
fill this critical gap in the assessment.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the available information, particularly the questionnaire
responses, the following high-priority risks have been identified. No
pre-existing vulnerability data was provided, thus this section focuses
on the control gaps.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified security gaps and enhance the overall
cybersecurity posture of Moxie Marketing, the following recommendations
are provided:</p>
<h2 id="multi-factor-authentication-mfa-implementation">Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) Implementation</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Access:</strong> Mandate MFA for
all user accounts accessing organizational email. This should cover all
platforms, including webmail, desktop clients, and mobile devices.
Evaluate solutions like Microsoft 365 MFA, Google Workspace MFA, or
third-party identity providers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Logins:</strong> Deploy MFA
for logging into all company computers, especially those accessing
sensitive data or systems. Consider solutions integrated with Active
Directory (if applicable) or other identity management systems to
enforce MFA at login. Prioritize administrative and privileged
accounts.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="security-awareness-training-enhancement">Security Awareness
Training Enhancement</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Mandatory New Employee Security Onboarding:</strong>
Develop and implement a mandatory security awareness training program
for all new employees as part of their onboarding process. This training
should cover phishing identification, password best practices, incident
reporting, and the organization’s acceptable use policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Phishing Simulations:</strong> Supplement annual
training with regular phishing simulation exercises for all employees.
This helps reinforce training, identify vulnerable individuals, and
continuously improve the organization’s human firewall.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="technical-assessment">Technical Assessment</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Conduct a Comprehensive Network Vulnerability
Scan:</strong> Engage a qualified cybersecurity firm to perform a
detailed external and internal network vulnerability assessment. This
will identify exposed services, outdated software, misconfigurations,
and other technical weaknesses that could not be assessed in this report
due to missing data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Vulnerability Management:</strong> Establish a
routine schedule for vulnerability scanning and patching of all
network-connected devices, applications, and operating systems.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Moxie Marketing has some foundational security controls in place,
such as an acceptable use policy and annual security awareness training.
However, the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for email and computer
logins, coupled with the absence of mandatory security awareness
training for new employees, represents significant and immediate risks.
Addressing these critical gaps, along with conducting a thorough
technical vulnerability assessment, will substantially improve the
organization’s resilience against common cyber threats and safeguard its
assets.</p>
