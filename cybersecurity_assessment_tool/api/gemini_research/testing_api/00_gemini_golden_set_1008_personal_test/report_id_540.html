<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report presents an assessment of the cybersecurity posture for
<strong>Iron River Finance</strong>. The assessment is primarily based
on a self-reported security questionnaire. Due to issues with the
provided data inputs, technical network scan results and details of
pre-existing vulnerabilities could not be incorporated into this
analysis.</p>
<p>The self-assessment revealed several critical security gaps,
particularly concerning Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) implementation
for email and sensitive data systems, as well as significant
deficiencies in security awareness training and policy enforcement.
These areas represent immediate and high-priority risks that require
urgent attention. Without comprehensive technical scan data and existing
risk registers, a full technical risk profile could not be
established.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>

<h1 id="security-control-review-self-assessment">Security Control Review

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>Network scan data was unavailable for analysis due to broken input.
Therefore, no technical vulnerabilities derived from network scans could
be assessed or reported in this document. A comprehensive assessment
would typically include details on open ports, services, product
versions, and identified vulnerabilities from the target network
<code>[Target IP]</code>.</p>

<p>This section outlines risks identified primarily from the

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the findings from the self-reported security questionnaire,
the following recommendations are provided to enhance the cybersecurity
posture of <strong>Iron River Finance</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Access:</strong> Immediately
deploy and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication for all email accounts.
This significantly strengthens defenses against credential theft and
unauthorized access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> Extend
Multi-Factor Authentication requirements to all systems storing or
processing sensitive organizational data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a clear, comprehensive AUP that outlines employee
responsibilities and acceptable behaviors regarding company IT
resources. Ensure all employees review and acknowledge this
policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Mandatory New Employee Security Awareness
Training:</strong> Implement a mandatory security awareness training
program for all new hires, covering fundamental cybersecurity
principles, common threats, and organizational policies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Annual Security Awareness Training for All
Employees:</strong> Conduct regular (at least annual) security awareness
training for all employees to keep them informed about evolving threats,
best practices, and policy updates.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>General Recommendation for Future Assessments:</strong>
Ensure complete and valid data inputs are provided for future
comprehensive assessments, including network scan data and pre-existing
vulnerability information, to allow for a holistic evaluation of the
cybersecurity posture.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The current cybersecurity posture of <strong>Iron River
Finance</strong> exhibits several critical vulnerabilities primarily
identified through the self-assessment questionnaire. Addressing the
identified gaps in MFA implementation, security awareness training, and
policy enforcement should be prioritized to mitigate significant risks
to the organization’s data and operations. A comprehensive technical
assessment, once all necessary data is available, will provide further
insights and facilitate a more robust risk management strategy.</p>
