<p><strong>Cybersecurity Posture Assessment Report</strong><br />

</p>
</div>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report presents a cybersecurity posture assessment for Symmetry
Architecture, primarily based on self-reported organizational data and a
security questionnaire.</p>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> The provided technical network scan
data (Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON) and pre-existing vulnerability data
(Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON) were identified as malformed or broken and
could not be processed. Consequently, this report’s technical findings
and a comprehensive risk overview are limited by the absence of this
critical information.</p>
<p>The assessment of available data reveals several critical gaps in
security controls, notably concerning Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
implementation for email and computer logins, the absence of an employee
acceptable use policy, and infrequent security awareness training. These
deficiencies introduce significant risks that require immediate
attention. Recommendations are provided to address these identified gaps
and establish a more robust security foundation.</p>

<td style="text-align: center;"></td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Critical Gap:</strong> Without
MFA, email accounts are highly vulnerable to unauthorized access via
credential theft, phishing, or brute-force attacks. This significantly
increases the risk of data breaches and business email compromise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Do you require MFA to log into
computers?</td>
<td style="text-align: center;"></td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Critical Gap:</strong> Lack of MFA
for computer logins increases the risk of successful attacks from
compromised credentials, enabling unauthorized access to internal
systems and potential lateral movement within the network.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;">Do you require MFA to access sensitive
data systems?</td>

<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Good Practice:</strong>
Implementing MFA for sensitive data systems is a strong control, helping
to protect critical assets from unauthorized access.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;">Does your organization have an employee
acceptable use policy?</td>
<td style="text-align: center;"></td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Critical Gap:</strong> The absence
of an AUP means there are no formal guidelines for employee conduct
regarding IT resource usage, increasing operational, legal, and security
risks from inappropriate or malicious activity.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;">Does your organization do security
awareness training for new employees?</td>

new employees on security best practices helps establish a
security-aware culture from the outset.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;">Does your organization do security
awareness training for all employees at least once per year?</td>
<td style="text-align: center;"></td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>High Risk:</strong> Without
regular, comprehensive training, employees may not be aware of evolving
cyber threats (e.g., sophisticated phishing, ransomware tactics),
increasing the organization’s susceptibility to human-error-driven
incidents.</td>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>The provided network scan data (Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON) was
identified as malformed and could not be parsed. Therefore, no technical
network scan results are available for analysis in this report. A
successful and complete external network scan is crucial for identifying
exposed services, outdated software versions, and potential
vulnerabilities from an attacker’s perspective. The inability to review
this data represents a significant blind spot in the overall security
posture assessment.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the available organizational data and security control
review, the following risks have been identified.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The pre-existing vulnerability data
(Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON) was identified as malformed and could not
be processed. This assessment therefore does not include a review of
known vulnerabilities from that source, which represents another
significant gap in understanding the organization’s overall risk
landscape.</p>

<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of MFA for Email</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Without MFA, email accounts are highly
susceptible to credential stuffing, phishing, and brute-force attacks.

</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of MFA for Computer Login</td>

<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Absence of Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP)</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Without a clear AUP, employees may
inadvertently or intentionally engage in activities that introduce
security risks (e.g., unauthorized software installations, risky
browsing, misuse of company assets), leading to malware infections, data
loss, or legal issues.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Infrequent Security Awareness
Training</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Gaps in annual security awareness training
mean employees may not be up-to-date on evolving threats (e.g., advanced
phishing tactics, ransomware vectors, social engineering techniques),
significantly increasing the likelihood of successful attacks due to
human error.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Unassessed External Exposure</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Due to the unavailability of network scan

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified gaps and enhance Symmetry Architecture’s
cybersecurity posture, the following actionable recommendations are
provided. These are prioritized to address the most significant risks
first.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="immediate-actions">Immediate Actions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Access:</strong> Mandate
Multi-Factor Authentication for all email accounts across the
organization. This is one of the most effective controls against
credential theft and phishing for email systems and should be
prioritized.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Login:</strong> Require MFA
for all computer login processes, especially for systems that access
sensitive data or network resources. This adds a critical layer of
security against unauthorized access from stolen or guessed
credentials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a comprehensive AUP outlining appropriate use of
company IT resources, data, and internet access. Ensure all employees
read, understand, and formally acknowledge the policy.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="ongoing-improvements">Ongoing
Improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Annual Security Awareness Training for All
Employees:</strong> Supplement new employee training with mandatory
annual refresher courses for all staff. Training should cover current
threats, phishing recognition, safe browsing, data handling, and company
policies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Perform Regular External Network Scans:</strong> Engage a
qualified cybersecurity professional to conduct regular (e.g., quarterly
or semi-annual) external network vulnerability scans. These scans are
essential to identify open ports, services, and software versions that
may expose the organization to attack.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish a Vulnerability Management Program:</strong>
Implement a systematic process for regularly identifying, assessing, and
remediating known vulnerabilities across all IT assets. This should
include leveraging vulnerability databases, patching schedules, and
asset inventory.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Review and Update Security Policies Regularly:</strong>
Ensure that all security policies, including the AUP, data handling
procedures, and incident response plans, are reviewed and updated at
least annually or when significant changes occur in the IT environment
or threat landscape.</p></li>
