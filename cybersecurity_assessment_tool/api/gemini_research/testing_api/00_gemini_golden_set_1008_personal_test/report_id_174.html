<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of Brimstone
Manufacturing, based on a correlation of a recent network scan,
organizational security questionnaire responses, and documented
pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The organization demonstrates good adherence to security best
practices in several areas, including employee acceptable use policies,
initial and annual security awareness training, and the implementation
of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and sensitive
data systems.</p>
<p>However, a significant vulnerability exists with the lack of MFA for
email access. This oversight represents a critical attack vector that
could lead to account compromise, phishing success, and broader network
intrusion.</p>
<p>The technical scan of the internal target showed only Port 80 (HTTP)
as closed, with no other open ports or active services identified. This
finding contradicts a pre-existing risk identifying an "Unencrypted Web
Server" on Port 80, suggesting either remediation or a discrepancy in
scope.</p>
<p>Recommendations prioritize the immediate implementation of MFA for
email, further investigation into the "Unencrypted Web Server" risk, and
a continuous improvement approach to cybersecurity controls.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-questionnaire-gaps">Analysis of Questionnaire
Gaps</h2>
<p>The most significant gap identified from the questionnaire is the
lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. This is a
critical deficiency, as email is a primary communication vector and a
frequent target for phishing and account compromise attacks. Without
MFA, compromised credentials can grant attackers full access to an
employee’s inbox, potentially leading to further internal
reconnaissance, data exfiltration, or business email compromise (BEC)
scams.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was conducted on the internal target . The scan
utilized <code>nmap</code> and reported the host as <code>up</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> (Not available in provided
metadata)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Used:</strong> nmap</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="open-ports-and-services">Open Ports and Services</h2>
<p>The scan identified the following ports and their states:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 80/tcp:</strong> <code>closed</code> (No service
identified)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>No other open ports or active services were identified during this
scan of the specified target. Detailed service versions or product
information were not available in the scan output.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes the identified security gaps from the
questionnaire, technical findings from the network scan, and
pre-existing organizational risks.</p>
<h2 id="identified-gaps-from-questionnaire">Identified Gaps (from
Questionnaire)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Risk Name:</strong> Lack of MFA for Email Access</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Category:</strong> Authentication/Access Control</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization does not require
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email accounts. This
significantly increases the risk of account compromise through phishing,
credential stuffing, or password brute-forcing. Compromised email
accounts can lead to data breaches, business email compromise (BEC)
attacks, and further unauthorized access to internal systems.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="technical-vulnerabilities-from-scan">Technical Vulnerabilities
(from Scan)</h2>
<p>Based on the provided network scan data, no active technical
vulnerabilities (e.g., outdated software, dangerously configured
services) were definitively identified on the target , as Port 80 was
found to be closed and no other open ports or service details were
provided.</p>
<h2 id="pre-existing-organizational-risks">Pre-existing Organizational
Risks</h2>
<p>The following risk was identified from pre-existing
documentation:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Risk Name:</strong> Unencrypted Web Server</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Category:</strong> Data in Transit Protection</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Severity (CVSS Score):</strong> 5.0 (Medium)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Overview:</strong> This risk states that Port 80 is open,
indicating the presence of an unencrypted web server. However, the
recent network scan of reported Port 80 as <code>closed</code>. This
discrepancy suggests that either the risk has been remediated for this
specific host, or the pre-existing risk pertains to a different asset or
a past configuration. Regardless, the risk highlights the potential for
unencrypted web traffic within the environment.</p></li>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are provided to
enhance Brimstone Manufacturing’s cybersecurity posture:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Access (High
Priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Immediately enable and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
for all user accounts accessing organizational email. This is the most
critical and impactful recommendation.</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluate suitable MFA solutions that integrate with the existing
email infrastructure (e.g., Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, on-premise
solutions).</p></li>
<li><p>Communicate the importance and provide training to all employees
on the use of MFA.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Review and Verify "Unencrypted Web Server"
Risk:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Investigate the discrepancy between the pre-existing "Unencrypted
Web Server" risk and the recent scan finding of Port 80 being closed on
.</p></li>
<li><p>Determine if the risk was indeed remediated, or if it pertains to
another server or public-facing asset not included in this
scan.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all public-facing and internal web services transmitting
sensitive data utilize HTTPS with valid SSL/TLS certificates. Implement
redirection from HTTP to HTTPS where applicable.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Expand Scope of Technical Scans:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Conduct regular, comprehensive vulnerability scans across all
internal and external network assets.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure scans include authenticated checks to identify
vulnerabilities within operating systems and applications.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement robust asset inventory management to ensure all
critical systems are regularly scanned and assessed.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Continuous Security Improvement:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Maintain regular security awareness training, reinforcing topics
like phishing recognition and the importance of MFA.</p></li>
<li><p>Periodically review and update the employee acceptable use policy
to reflect current threats and organizational practices.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider engaging in simulated phishing exercises to test
employee resilience against social engineering attacks.</p></li>
