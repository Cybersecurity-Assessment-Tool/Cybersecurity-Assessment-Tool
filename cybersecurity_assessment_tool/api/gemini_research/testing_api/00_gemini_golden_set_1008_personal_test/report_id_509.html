<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive assessment of the cybersecurity
posture for Mainframe Managed, based on a review of organizational data,
existing risk registers, and a targeted network scan. Our analysis
reveals critical gaps in multi-factor authentication (MFA)
implementation across key access vectors, posing significant risks to
organizational assets. Furthermore, the network scan identified an
exposed Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) service on an internal host,
correlating with a previously identified RDP exposure on another system.
These findings collectively indicate a moderate to high-risk posture,
primarily due to easily exploitable access points. Positive aspects
include established security awareness training programs and an
acceptable use policy. This report outlines detailed findings and
actionable recommendations to mitigate identified risks and enhance the
overall security posture.</p>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This cybersecurity posture assessment was conducted to provide
Mainframe Managed with an independent evaluation of its current security
landscape. The assessment involved the analysis and correlation of three
primary data sources:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Network Scan Data (Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON):</strong>
Technical findings from a scan of internal network assets.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Organizational Data (Input_2_Org_Data_JSON):</strong>
Responses to a security questionnaire providing insight into current
security controls and policies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Current Risks Data (Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON):</strong>
A summary of existing identified vulnerabilities and their
severities.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The objective of this report is to synthesize these inputs, identify
critical security gaps and risks, and provide actionable recommendations
for improvement.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-questionnaire-findings">Analysis
of Questionnaire Findings</h2>
<p>The responses indicate a strong foundation in security awareness and
policy implementation, with both new and existing employees receiving
annual training, and an acceptable use policy in place. This
demonstrates a commitment to foundational human-centric security
controls.</p>
<p>However, a critical gap is identified in the lack of multi-factor
authentication (MFA) across all surveyed access points: email, computer
logins, and sensitive data systems. The absence of MFA significantly
increases the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised
credentials, which remain a primary vector for cyberattacks. This is
considered a high-severity vulnerability that requires immediate
attention.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A targeted network scan was performed on an internal host. The scan
details are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> 2026-01-27</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>10.10.10.51</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Used:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="detailed-findings">Detailed Findings</h2>
<p>The scan identified the following open port and service:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port:</strong> <code>3389/tcp</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>State:</strong> Open</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Service:</strong> <code>ms-wbt-server</code> (Remote
Desktop Protocol - RDP)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The presence of an open RDP port (<code>3389</code>) on an internal
system (<code>10.10.10.51</code>) indicates that this service is
potentially accessible within the network. While the scan was internal,
the exposure of RDP services can pose a significant risk if not
adequately secured (e.g., strong passwords, account lockout,
network-level access restrictions, or VPN required for access). RDP is a
frequent target for attackers attempting to gain initial access or move
laterally within a compromised network.</p>

</div>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="risk-correlation-and-impact">Risk Correlation
and Impact</h2>
<p>The analysis reveals a critical theme: accessible endpoints that lack
robust authentication. The lack of MFA across all major access points
(email, computers, sensitive data) represents a systemic vulnerability.
An attacker who obtains a single set of credentials could gain
widespread access without an additional layer of verification.</p>
<p>The discovery of RDP on <code>10.10.10.51</code> by the network scan
is a significant finding that correlates directly with the client’s
existing known risk of "RDP Exposure" on <code>10.10.10.50</code>. This
indicates that RDP exposure is not an isolated incident but rather a
potential pattern within the internal network. Exploitation of exposed
RDP services can lead to remote code execution, data exfiltration, or
installation of malware, including ransomware. Given the CVSS score of
9.0 associated with the existing RDP risk, this vulnerability is highly
critical.</p>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the identified risks and security gaps, the following
recommendations are provided to enhance Mainframe Managed’s
cybersecurity posture:</p>
<h2 id="immediate-actions-high-priority">Immediate Actions (High
Priority)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Access:</strong> Immediately
deploy and enforce multi-factor authentication for all email accounts.
This should be a top priority to protect against phishing and credential
stuffing attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Logins:</strong> Require MFA
for all user and administrative logins to company computers and servers.
This adds a critical layer of security against lateral movement and
unauthorized access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> Ensure
that access to all systems containing sensitive organizational or client
data is protected by MFA.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Restrict RDP Access to <code>10.10.10.51</code> and
<code>10.10.10.50</code>:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Review and implement strict firewall rules to limit RDP access to
only necessary, authorized internal sources.</p></li>
<li><p>For external access, mandate the use of a Virtual Private Network
(VPN) and ensure strong authentication (preferably MFA) for VPN
access.</p></li>
<li><p>Enforce strong, unique passwords and account lockout policies for
all RDP accounts.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider disabling RDP entirely on systems where it is not
absolutely essential.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="long-term-strategies-ongoing-improvement">Long-Term Strategies
(Ongoing Improvement)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Internal Network Segmentation Review:</strong>
Evaluate current network segmentation to ensure that critical assets are
isolated and RDP services, if necessary, are only available within
highly restricted segments.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement a Vulnerability Management Program:</strong>
Establish a regular schedule for internal and external vulnerability
scanning and penetration testing. This will help proactively identify
and remediate exposed services, outdated software, and
misconfigurations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Review and Strengthen Password Policies:</strong>
Complement MFA implementation with robust password policies, including
requirements for complexity, length, and regular rotation for accounts
that do not use MFA.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regularly Review Access Controls:</strong> Periodically
audit user access rights and permissions, ensuring the principle of
least privilege is applied across all systems and data.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Mainframe Managed demonstrates a positive commitment to security
awareness and policy. However, the absence of multi-factor
authentication across critical access points and the presence of exposed
RDP services represent significant vulnerabilities that could be
exploited by attackers. Addressing these high-priority items,
particularly the pervasive lack of MFA and RDP exposure, will
substantially improve the organization’s resilience against common cyber
threats. By diligently implementing the recommended actions, Mainframe
Managed can significantly uplift its cybersecurity posture and better
protect its assets and data.</p>
