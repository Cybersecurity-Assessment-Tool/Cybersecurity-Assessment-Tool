<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive assessment of Clear Path’s
current cybersecurity posture, synthesizing findings from a recent
network scan, organizational security questionnaire responses, and
pre-existing risk data. Our analysis highlights several critical areas
for improvement, particularly regarding multi-factor authentication for
sensitive data systems, the absence of an acceptable use policy, and
infrequent security awareness training. While the network scan revealed
no immediately exploitable open ports on the scanned target, existing
vulnerability data indicates past concerns that warrant re-evaluation.
Recommendations are provided to address identified gaps and strengthen
the overall security posture.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-questionnaire-gaps">Analysis of
Questionnaire Gaps</h2>
<p>The "No" responses indicate significant security control gaps that
could expose the organization to various risks:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> The lack of
multi-factor authentication on systems holding sensitive data
significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access through
compromised credentials, potentially leading to data breaches.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> The
absence of an AUP leaves employees without clear guidelines on
acceptable technology use. This can lead to misuse of company resources,
increased risk of data leakage, and potential compliance
issues.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Annual Security Awareness Training:</strong> While new
employees receive training, the lack of annual refreshers means that
existing employees may not be up-to-date on the latest threats,
organizational policies, or security best practices, leading to a
degradation of security awareness over time.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was conducted on the target . The scan identified the
host as active.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target Host:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> <em>Information not available in
provided data.</em></p></li>

<li><p><strong>Specific Port States:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Port 80 (HTTP): <strong>Closed</strong></p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The scan indicates that no commonly exploited open ports were
directly exposed on this particular host at the time of the scan. Port
80, often associated with unencrypted web traffic, was found to be
closed.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="risk-correlation">Risk Correlation</h2>
<p>The most significant risks identified primarily stem from
organizational policy and training deficiencies, as highlighted by the
questionnaire responses. These gaps, particularly concerning MFA for
sensitive data and the absence of an AUP, present substantial internal
vulnerabilities that could be exploited through human error or social
engineering. While the recent network scan did not identify new
technical vulnerabilities in terms of open ports on the scanned target,
the pre-existing risk of an "Unencrypted Web Server" from prior
assessments underscores the importance of a holistic view. Although the
immediate technical exposure for an unencrypted web server (port 80
open) is not present on the scanned asset according to this latest scan,
the underlying potential for unencrypted services or similar
vulnerabilities on other assets should still be considered. The focus
should be on addressing the policy and human-factor related risks
proactively.</p>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To enhance Clear Path’s cybersecurity posture, the following
recommendations are provided:</p>
<h2 id="policy-and-training-enhancements">Policy and Training
Enhancements</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong>
Mandate multi-factor authentication for all systems that store, process,
or transmit sensitive organizational data. This is a critical control
for protecting against credential theft and unauthorized
access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a clear and comprehensive AUP that outlines
acceptable and unacceptable use of company IT resources, data, and
internet access. Ensure all employees acknowledge, understand, and
adhere to this policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Annual Security Awareness Training:</strong>
Conduct mandatory security awareness training for all employees at least
once per year. Training should cover current threats (e.g., phishing,
social engineering), data handling best practices, and organizational
security policies.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="technical-control-review">Technical Control Review</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Re-evaluate Web Server Security (if applicable):</strong>
Although the recent scan shows Port 80 as closed on , if other web
servers exist within the organization or if this target previously
hosted an unencrypted web service, ensure that all web traffic is
encrypted using HTTPS with strong TLS protocols. Redirect HTTP traffic
to HTTPS and disable unencrypted services where possible.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Comprehensive Network Scanning:</strong> Conduct regular
and comprehensive network vulnerability scans across the entire internal
and external IP range to identify all open ports, outdated software, and
misconfigurations. This ensures a complete and up-to-date technical risk
profile.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="general-security-best-practices">General Security Best
Practices</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Regular Patch Management:</strong> Implement a robust
patch management program to ensure all operating systems, applications,
and network devices are regularly updated and patched to protect against
known vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Incident Response Plan:</strong> Develop, test, and
regularly update a detailed incident response plan to ensure the
organization can effectively detect, respond to, and recover from
security incidents.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Backups:</strong> Implement and regularly test a
robust backup and recovery strategy for all critical data to ensure
business continuity in the event of a data loss incident.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Clear Path demonstrates a foundational understanding of some security
controls, such as MFA for email and computer login, and initial security
awareness training for new hires. However, critical gaps exist
concerning MFA for sensitive data, comprehensive acceptable use
policies, and ongoing security awareness education for all employees.
Addressing these policy and human-factor related risks, alongside
continued technical vigilance through regular scanning and patching,
will significantly strengthen Clear Path’s cybersecurity posture and
resilience against emerging threats.</p>
