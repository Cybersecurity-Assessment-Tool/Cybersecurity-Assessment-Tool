<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment for <strong>Top Tier</strong>. The assessment was conducted
based on an organizational questionnaire, an attempted network scan, and
an analysis of existing vulnerability data.</p>
<p>The assessment revealed critical gaps in security controls,
particularly concerning the widespread implementation of Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) and foundational security awareness programs. While
the organization does utilize MFA for sensitive data systems, its
absence for email and computer logins presents significant exposure.
Furthermore, the lack of an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and
comprehensive security training for employees indicates a critical
weakness in the human element of security.</p>
<p>It is important to note that due to issues with the provided input
data, a comprehensive technical network vulnerability scan could not be
performed, and pre-existing vulnerability data was unavailable. This
limits the scope of the technical assessment and introduces an inherent
risk of unknown technical vulnerabilities. Urgent recommendations are
provided to address these identified deficiencies and improve the
overall security posture.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following information was provided for the organization under
assessment:</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan of the target <code>[Target IP]</code> was attempted.
However, the provided scan data (Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON) was found to
be broken or malformed, preventing any analysis of open ports, services,
products, or versions. Therefore, a technical vulnerability assessment
based on network scanning could not be performed as part of this report.
This significantly limits the ability to identify potential
network-based vulnerabilities.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the available organizational data and the security control
review, the following risks have been identified. Note that the absence
of valid network scan data and pre-existing vulnerability data means
this assessment is primarily based on policy and procedural gaps.</p>

<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Inadequate MFA for Email
Access</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The absence of multi-factor authentication
for email accounts significantly increases the risk of account
compromise through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force
attacks. Compromised email accounts can lead to business email
compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, or further internal network
penetration.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Lack of MFA for Computer
Logins</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Without MFA for computer logins,
compromised user credentials (e.g., via keyloggers, malware, or social
engineering) can grant direct access to internal systems, potentially
leading to unauthorized data access, system disruption, or ransomware
deployment.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">High</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Missing Employee Acceptable Use
Policy</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The lack of a formal Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP) means employees may not be aware of their responsibilities
regarding company IT assets, data handling, and internet usage. This can
lead to non-compliant behavior, legal liabilities, and an increased risk
of security incidents.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Medium</td>
</tr>

<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Insufficient New Employee Security
Training</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">New employees, without proper security
awareness training during onboarding, are more susceptible to social
engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) and may inadvertently introduce
security risks due to a lack of understanding of organizational policies
and best practices.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Medium</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Absence of Annual Security
Awareness Training</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Without regular, mandatory security
awareness training for all employees, security knowledge can degrade
over time, and employees may not be updated on new threats and
organizational policies. This maintains a higher human risk factor for
breaches.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Medium</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Incomplete Technical Vulnerability
Assessment</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Due to broken input data for network
