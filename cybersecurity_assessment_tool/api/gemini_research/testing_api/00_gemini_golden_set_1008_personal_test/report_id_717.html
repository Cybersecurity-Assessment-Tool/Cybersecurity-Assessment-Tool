<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of <strong>Silver Leaf
Collective</strong> based on a recent network scan, organizational
security questionnaire responses, and an existing risk register. While
some foundational controls are in place, critical vulnerabilities and
significant security gaps have been identified. Specifically, an open
port <code>8080</code> was found exposing a system titled “TOP SECRET
DB”, indicating a severe data exposure risk. Furthermore, the
organization lacks Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer
logins, an Employee Acceptable Use Policy, and security awareness
training for new hires. Addressing these issues is paramount to
enhancing the organization’s overall security resilience.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-security-controls">Analysis of
Security Controls</h2>
<p>Several critical security control gaps were identified based on best
practices:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA for Computer Logins:</strong> The absence of
Multi-Factor Authentication for computer logins significantly increases
the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials, as a
single password breach could grant full system access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Acceptable Use Policy:</strong> Lacking an Acceptable Use
Policy (AUP) means employees may not be fully aware of their
responsibilities regarding company IT assets and data, potentially
leading to misuse, insecure practices, or legal liabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>New Employee Security Training:</strong> The lack of
security awareness training for new employees leaves them vulnerable to
social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) and unaware of
organizational security best practices from their first day, making them
potential weak links in the security chain.</p></li>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="open-ports-and-services">Open Ports and

<p>The scan identified the following open port:</p>

<li><p><strong>State:</strong> Open</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Identified Service:</strong> HTTP (inferred from
title)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Description:</strong> A web service was detected on port
<code>8080</code>. The HTTP title for this service explicitly states
“TOP SECRET DB”. This indicates an extremely sensitive database or data
store is exposed via a web interface. This finding presents a critical
vulnerability, as unauthorized access to this port could lead to a
severe data breach, intellectual property theft, or compromise of
sensitive organizational information.</p></li>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="correlation-with-existing-risks">Correlation
with Existing Risks</h2>
<p>The provided existing risk register entry for “Port 8080 Secured”
(Severity: 0.0) states that “Port 8080 is confirmed secure and false
positive.” <strong>Our analysis critically contradicts this
assessment.</strong> The Nmap scan results unequivocally show an open
port <code>8080</code> with a service explicitly identified as “TOP
SECRET DB”. This is a severe, confirmed vulnerability, not a false
positive, and warrants immediate attention. The existing risk entry must
be updated to reflect the current, critical finding. Relying on an
outdated or incorrect risk assessment can lead to significant security
oversights.</p>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following recommendations are provided to mitigate the identified
risks and significantly improve the organization’s cybersecurity
posture.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Action: Secure “TOP SECRET DB” on Port
8080</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Urgency:</strong> Critical.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediately investigate the system
listening on port <code>8080</code>. Determine the purpose and necessity
of its exposure. Implement strong access controls, strict network
segmentation (e.g., firewall rules, VLANs), and ensure the service is
not directly internet-facing unless absolutely necessary and protected
by multiple layers of security (e.g., Web Application Firewall, VPN).
Consider shutting down the service until proper security measures are
thoroughly reviewed and implemented. Review and update the associated
risk register entry to accurately reflect this critical
vulnerability.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Logins</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Urgency:</strong> High.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Roll out Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) for all computer login processes across the organization,
including workstations, servers, and network devices. This drastically
reduces the risk of unauthorized access even if primary credentials are
compromised.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Urgency:</strong> High.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Create a clear, comprehensive AUP that
defines acceptable and unacceptable use of company IT resources, data,
and communication systems. Ensure all employees, new and existing, read,
understand, and acknowledge the policy. Integrate the AUP into both
onboarding and annual security awareness training programs.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Initiate Security Awareness Training for New
Employees</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Urgency:</strong> High.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Establish a mandatory and comprehensive
security awareness training program for all new hires as part of their
onboarding process. This training should cover topics such as phishing,
social engineering, password hygiene, data handling policies, and
incident reporting procedures to ensure new employees are
security-conscious from day one.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p><strong>Silver Leaf Collective</strong> demonstrates a mixed security
posture. While annual security awareness training is conducted for
existing staff and MFA is used for email and sensitive data systems,
critical gaps persist that significantly elevate the organization’s risk
profile. The most pressing concern is the exposed “TOP SECRET DB” on
port <code>8080</code>, which demands immediate, high-priority
remediation. Coupled with the absence of MFA for computer logins, a
formal AUP, and dedicated security training for new employees, these
vulnerabilities could lead to significant security incidents, data
breaches, and reputational damage. Prioritizing the implementation of
the recommended actions will substantially strengthen the organization’s
defense against current and evolving cyber threats.</p>
