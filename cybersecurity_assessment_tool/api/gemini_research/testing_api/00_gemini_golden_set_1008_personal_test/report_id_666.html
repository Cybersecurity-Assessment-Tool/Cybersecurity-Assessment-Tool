<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">1. Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This assessment highlights key areas requiring immediate attention
for <strong>Iron River Finance</strong>. The organization demonstrates
commitment in some areas, such as MFA for sensitive data systems and
annual security training. However, critical vulnerabilities stemming
from a lack of MFA for email access, the absence of an employee
acceptable use policy, and insufficient security awareness training for
new employees pose substantial risks. Technically, the scanned target
showed no open ports, which is positive, but this finding needs to be
considered in light of a previously identified risk for an "Unencrypted
Web Server" on Port 80, suggesting either a recent remediation or a
scope mismatch. Addressing the policy and training gaps is paramount to
enhancing the overall security posture and reducing the likelihood of
successful social engineering attacks or insider threats.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="network-scan-overview">4.1. Network Scan
Overview</h2>
<p>A network scan was conducted on the target <code>192.168.0.5</code>.
The scan aimed to identify accessible services and potential
vulnerabilities.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="detailed-findings">4.2. Detailed
Findings</h2>
<p>The Nmap scan indicated that the target host <code>192.168.0.5</code>
was up.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports and Services:</strong> No open ports were
identified during this scan. Specifically, Port 80 was found to be
<code>closed</code>. This suggests a hardened network perimeter or that
services are not exposed on standard ports or to the scanned
IP.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: The absence of open ports on this specific target is a
positive finding, implying a reduced attack surface from an external
network perspective, assuming this target represents a critical
external-facing asset.</em></p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">6. Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and enhance the overall
cybersecurity posture of Iron River Finance, the following
recommendations are provided:</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="immediate-actions-high-priority">6.1.
Immediate Actions (High Priority)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Access:</strong> Mandate
Multi-Factor Authentication for all email accounts. This is a critical
control against credential compromise and phishing attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Introduce Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong> Establish a mandatory security awareness training
program for all new hires, to be completed before granting access to
company systems.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="short-term-actions-medium-priority">6.2.
Short-Term Actions (Medium Priority)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a comprehensive AUP that clearly outlines
expectations for technology use, data handling, and security practices.
Ensure all employees read and acknowledge the policy annually.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Verify Port 80 Status and Scope:</strong> Investigate the
discrepancy regarding the "Unencrypted Web Server" risk. Confirm if a
service was previously running on Port 80, if it has been remediated, or
if the risk pertains to a different asset not included in the current
scan scope. If such a service still exists, ensure it is properly
secured with HTTPS or decommissioned if no longer needed.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="long-term-strategy">6.3. Long-Term
Strategy</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Regular Security Audits:</strong> Conduct periodic
comprehensive security audits and penetration tests to continuously
identify and address vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enhance Incident Response Plan:</strong> Ensure a
well-documented and regularly tested incident response plan is in place
to effectively handle security breaches.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">7. Conclusion</h1>
<p>Iron River Finance exhibits a strong foundation in some areas of
cybersecurity, particularly with MFA for critical systems and annual
security training. However, the lack of MFA for email, absence of a
formal AUP, and insufficient training for new employees represent
significant vulnerabilities that could be exploited. By implementing the
recommended actions, Iron River Finance can significantly improve its
defense against common cyber threats and foster a more robust security
culture.</p>
