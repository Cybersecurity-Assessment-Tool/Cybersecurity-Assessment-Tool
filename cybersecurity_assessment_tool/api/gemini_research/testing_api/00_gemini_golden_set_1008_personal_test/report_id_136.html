<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for Sovereign Trust, based on an organizational questionnaire, a
technical network scan, and a review of existing risks. The organization
demonstrates good foundational security practices by implementing
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and computer logins.
However, critical gaps were identified, notably the lack of MFA for
sensitive data systems and significant deficiencies in security
awareness training for both new and existing employees. The technical
scan on the target <code>192.168.1.100</code> showed no open ports,
which is a positive finding for the specified host. Addressing the
identified risks, particularly regarding MFA for sensitive data and
employee training, is paramount to enhancing Sovereign Trust’s overall
security resilience.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on the specified target to identify open
ports and services that could represent potential vulnerabilities.</p>
<h2 id="scan-details">Scan Details</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>192.168.1.100</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Used:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> The target host
<code>192.168.1.100</code> was found to be <strong>Up</strong> and
responsive.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="port-scan-findings">Port Scan Findings</h2>
<p>The scan indicated that <strong>no open ports were detected</strong>
on <code>192.168.1.100</code> during the assessment. All extraports were
reported as closed.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports:</strong> None</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Services Identified:</strong> None (due to no open
ports)</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="analysis-of-technical-scan">Analysis of Technical Scan</h3>
<p>The absence of open ports on the scanned target
<code>192.168.1.100</code> is a positive finding, suggesting a
well-hardened system or that it does not provide network services on
standard ports. It’s important to note that this scan was limited to a
single internal IP address, and a broader assessment of the entire
network perimeter and internal infrastructure would provide a more
complete picture of the attack surface.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the organizational data and technical scan
results, the following key risks have been identified:</p>

<caption>Identified Risks</caption>
<thead>
<tr>

</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data
Systems</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Without MFA, a single compromised
credential (e.g., username/password) can grant an attacker full access
to sensitive data, leading to data breaches, compliance failures, and
reputational damage.</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">Critical</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Inadequate New Employee Security
Training</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">New employees who lack proper security
awareness training are more susceptible to social engineering attacks
(e.g., phishing, pretexting), potentially introducing malware or
compromising credentials from day one.</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">High</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Insufficient Annual Security Awareness
Training</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The absence of regular security awareness
training across all employees increases the overall vulnerability of the
organization to evolving cyber threats, as employees may not recognize
new attack vectors or reinforce best practices.</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">High</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Limited Scan Coverage (Implicit)</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">While no vulnerabilities were found on the
scanned IP, the limited scope (single internal IP, no specific date, no
service versions) means other systems or broader network exposures
remain unassessed.</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">Medium</td>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and enhance Sovereign Trust’s
cybersecurity posture, the following actionable recommendations are
provided:</p>
<h2 id="critical-recommendations">Critical Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Mandate and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication
for all systems that store, process, or provide access to sensitive
organizational data (e.g., financial systems, HR databases, customer
data platforms).</p></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
access even if primary credentials are stolen or guessed.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="high-priority-recommendations">High Priority
Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Establish New Employee Security Awareness
Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Develop and implement a mandatory cybersecurity
awareness training program for all new hires. This training should cover
common threats (phishing, social engineering), company security policies
(AUP), password best practices, and incident reporting
procedures.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Ensures that all employees start with a
foundational understanding of cybersecurity risks and best practices,
reducing the likelihood of early-stage breaches.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Annual Security Awareness Training for All
Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Institute a mandatory annual (at minimum)
cybersecurity awareness training program for all employees. This
training should be engaging, up-to-date with current threat landscapes,
and tailored to organizational risks.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Reinforces security best practices, educates
employees on new threats, and helps maintain a security-conscious
culture, significantly reducing the human element risk.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="general-security-recommendations">General Security
Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Expand Network Scanning Scope and Frequency:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Conduct regular, comprehensive network scans
(both internal and external) across the entire IT infrastructure. This
should include vulnerability scanning to identify outdated software
versions, misconfigurations, and other potential weaknesses.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Provides a more complete and continuous view of
the organization’s attack surface, allowing for proactive remediation of
vulnerabilities.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Review Purpose of Scanned IP
<code>192.168.1.100</code>:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> While no open ports were found, it is
recommended to review the specific role and importance of
<code>192.168.1.100</code> within the network to ensure its
configuration aligns with its intended purpose and security
requirements.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Ensures that critical assets are appropriately
secured and monitored, even if they appear hardened.</p></li>
