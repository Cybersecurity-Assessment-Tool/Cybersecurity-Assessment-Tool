<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture assessment for
Crestview Analytics, based on provided organizational data, security
questionnaire responses, and a limited network scan. While the network
scan of the specified internal IP (<code>192.168.1.100</code>) revealed
no open ports or services, indicating a positive external attack surface
for that specific host, the organization exhibits significant critical
gaps in fundamental security controls. Key areas of concern include the
absence of multi-factor authentication (MFA) for email access and a
complete lack of a structured security awareness training program for
both new and existing employees. These human-centric vulnerabilities
represent high-priority risks that could be exploited through phishing
or social engineering, undermining otherwise solid technical controls.
Immediate action on these critical areas is strongly recommended to
enhance the overall security posture.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was conducted on the target IP address

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target Scanned:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> The host was detected as
<code>up</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports/Services:</strong> No open ports or services
were detected on the scanned target. All extra ports were reported as
<code>closed</code>. This indicates a minimal network attack surface for
this specific host based on the provided scan data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Scan date not available in provided
metadata.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: The provided network scan data was limited to a single
internal IP address. A comprehensive assessment would typically involve
scanning the full external perimeter and relevant internal segments, as
well as conducting vulnerability scans to identify software-level
weaknesses.</em></p>

Authentication (MFA) for Email Access</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Email accounts are frequent targets for
phishing and credential stuffing. Without MFA, compromised credentials
can grant attackers full access to an employee’s email, potentially
leading to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, or
further internal network access. This is a critical risk due to the
widespread use and sensitivity of email communication.</td>

Training for New Employees</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">New employees are often unfamiliar with an
organization’s specific security policies and common threat vectors.
Without initial training, they are more susceptible to social
engineering attacks, malware, and policy violations, increasing the
overall risk profile and potentially creating an easy entry point for
attackers.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;">Cyber threats constantly evolve, and
without regular, updated training, employees’ knowledge of best

persistent vulnerability to social engineering, phishing, and other
human-centric attacks across the entire organization, negating efforts
to maintain a resilient security posture.</td>

</div>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and enhance Crestview Analytics’
cybersecurity posture, the following actionable recommendations are
provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email
Access:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediately deploy and enforce MFA for
all employee email accounts. Consider robust options such as
authenticator apps, hardware security keys, or FIDO2-compliant
solutions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Significantly reduces the risk of
unauthorized access to email accounts even if passwords are stolen or
compromised, providing a critical layer of defense against phishing and
credential stuffing attacks.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Mandatory Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop and implement a comprehensive
security awareness training program as a mandatory part of the
onboarding process for all new hires. This training should cover
essential topics such as phishing recognition, strong password hygiene,
safe browsing practices, secure data handling, and the procedure for
reporting suspicious activities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Equips new employees with fundamental
security knowledge and instills best practices from day one,
significantly reducing their susceptibility to common attack vectors and
minimizing insider threat risks.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Annual Security Awareness Training for All
Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Establish and consistently conduct
mandatory annual (or more frequent) security awareness training for all
existing employees. This training should be regularly updated to reflect
new and evolving cyber threats, organizational policies, and industry
best practices. Incorporate interactive elements and simulated phishing
exercises to enhance engagement and effectiveness.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Maintains a high and current level of
security awareness across the entire organization, reinforces best
practices, and educates employees on emerging threats, thereby creating
a more resilient human firewall against a wide range of
cyberattacks.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Expand Scope of Technical Assessments:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> While the current network scan for
<code>192.168.1.100</code> showed no open ports, consider expanding
future technical assessments to include a wider range of internal IP
addresses, external perimeter assets, and the implementation of regular
vulnerability scanning on hosts and applications. This should also
include penetration testing where appropriate.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Provides a more comprehensive and
holistic view of the organization’s network attack surface and
identifies potential software misconfigurations, outdated versions, and
other technical vulnerabilities that may not be apparent from a basic
port scan.</p></li>
</ul></li>
