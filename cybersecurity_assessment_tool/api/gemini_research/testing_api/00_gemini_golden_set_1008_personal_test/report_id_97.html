<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings from a cybersecurity assessment
conducted for Aventine Research. The assessment included a review of
self-reported security controls, a technical network scan, and an
analysis of existing risk data. Key findings indicate significant
security gaps primarily related to the absence of Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for critical systems like email and computer
logins, outdated server software, an SSL certificate common name
mismatch, and insufficient annual security awareness training. These
findings suggest a moderate to high-risk security posture that requires
immediate attention to enhance resilience against common cyber threats.
Specific recommendations are provided to address these vulnerabilities
and improve the overall security landscape.</p>

implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and ongoing security
awareness training. The following table summarizes the responses to a
key security questionnaire.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-questionnaire-findings">Analysis
of Questionnaire Findings</h2>
<p>The review highlights critical areas where security posture can be
significantly improved:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA Gaps:</strong> The absence of MFA for email and
computer login presents a substantial risk, as these are primary targets
for credential theft and unauthorized access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Training Frequency:</strong> While new employees receive
training, the lack of annual security awareness training for all staff
means the organization is missing a crucial opportunity to reinforce
best practices and educate against evolving threats.</p></li>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was conducted on on 2025-11-22 at 10:00:00Z. The scan
revealed the following open ports and services:</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="open-ports-and-services">Open Ports and
Services</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 443/TCP (HTTPS)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Service:</strong> HTTPS (HTTP over SSL/TLS)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Product:</strong> Nginx</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.18.0</p></li>
<li><p><strong>SSL Certificate Details:</strong> The SSL certificate
presented has a Common Name (CN) of
<code>www.acme-corp.com</code>.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of
Technical Findings</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Outdated Nginx Version:</strong> Nginx 1.18.0 was
released several years ago and is no longer actively maintained with
security patches, making it vulnerable to known exploits. Upgrading to a
currently supported stable version is critical.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>SSL Certificate Common Name Mismatch:</strong> The common
name <code>www.acme-corp.com</code> on the SSL certificate does not
match the organization’s assumed domain
<code>AventineResearch.net</code>. This can lead to browser warnings for
users, undermine trust, and suggests a potential misconfiguration or use
of a default/incorrect certificate.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of self-reported controls and technical scan
results, the following risks have been identified. No pre-existing
vulnerabilities were provided in the initial data.</p>

the Nginx web server from version 1.18.0 to the latest stable and
supported release. Ensure proper testing is conducted before deploying
to production.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Patching:</strong> Establish a regular patching
and update schedule for all server software and operating systems to
ensure all known vulnerabilities are addressed promptly.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Timeline:</strong> <em>Short-term (within 1-3
months)</em></p>
<h2 id="correct-ssl-certificate-configuration">Correct SSL Certificate
Configuration</h2>

correctly configured to serve the appropriate certificate, matching the
domain it is hosting.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Timeline:</strong> <em>Immediate/Critical</em></p>
<h2 id="enhance-security-awareness-training-program">Enhance Security
Awareness Training Program</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Annual Training:</strong> Institute mandatory annual
security awareness training for all employees, covering topics such as
phishing, social engineering, password hygiene, and data handling best
practices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Phishing Simulations:</strong> Consider regular simulated
phishing campaigns to test employee vigilance and reinforce training
concepts.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Timeline:</strong> <em>Medium-term (within 3-6
months)</em></p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Addressing the identified risks, particularly the implementation of
MFA and proper SSL certificate management, will significantly improve
Aventine Research’s defensive capabilities against common cyber threats.
Proactive measures, including regular software updates and comprehensive
security awareness training, are essential for maintaining a strong and
resilient cybersecurity posture.</p>
