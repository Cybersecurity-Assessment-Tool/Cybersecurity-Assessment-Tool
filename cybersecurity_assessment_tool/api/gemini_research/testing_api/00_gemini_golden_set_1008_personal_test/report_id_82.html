<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive assessment of the current
cybersecurity posture for <strong>Atlas Mapping</strong>, based on
provided organizational data and a security control questionnaire. While
no active network scan data was provided, the analysis of the
organizational security questionnaire reveals critical areas for
improvement, particularly regarding Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
implementation for computer logins and the frequency of security
awareness training. Addressing these gaps is paramount to enhancing the
overall security resilience of the organization.</p>

</div>
<h2 id="key-findings-from-questionnaire">Key Findings from
Questionnaire</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Positive Implementations</strong>: The organization has
implemented MFA for email and sensitive data systems, which are crucial
steps in protecting high-value assets. An acceptable use policy and
security awareness training for new employees are also positive
foundations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Critical Gaps Identified</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA for Computer Logins</strong>: The lack of MFA for
computer logins is a significant vulnerability. Usernames and passwords
alone are highly susceptible to credential stuffing, phishing, and
brute-force attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Annual Security Awareness Training</strong>: While new
employees receive training, the absence of annual training for all staff
means that security knowledge can degrade over time, leaving the
organization more vulnerable to evolving threats like advanced phishing
campaigns and social engineering tactics.</p></li>
</ul></li>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<h2 id="network-scan-findings">Network Scan Findings</h2>
<p>The provided network scan data for the target
<code>[Target IP]</code> was empty. Therefore, this report cannot
include specific findings related to open ports, services, or potential
vulnerabilities from a network perspective. An active network scan is
crucial for a complete security assessment.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the security questionnaire, two primary
risks have been identified. No pre-existing vulnerabilities were
provided, nor were any found via network scan.</p>

<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of MFA for Computer Logins</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Without Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
for computer logins, a successful compromise of a single set of user
credentials (e.g., via phishing or weak passwords) could grant an
attacker unauthorized access to employee workstations, internal network
resources, and potentially sensitive data without an additional layer of
verification. This significantly increases the risk of lateral movement
and data breaches.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;">Insufficient Annual Security Awareness
Training</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">While new employees receive training, the
absence of annual security awareness training for all employees leads to
a decay in critical security knowledge and best practices. Employees may
become less vigilant against evolving threats such as sophisticated
phishing attacks, social engineering, and malware, making the
organization more susceptible to human-factor security incidents.</td>

</div>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified gaps and enhance the overall cybersecurity
posture, the following recommendations are provided:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for All
Computer Logins</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action</strong>: Mandate and configure MFA for all user
accounts logging into company computers and internal systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit</strong>: Significantly reduces the risk of
unauthorized access even if primary credentials are compromised, acting
as a critical barrier against credential-based attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority</strong>: <strong>High</strong></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish and Enforce Annual Security Awareness Training
for All Employees</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action</strong>: Develop and implement a comprehensive
security awareness training program that is mandatory for all employees
annually. This should cover topics such as phishing, social engineering,
password hygiene, data handling, and incident reporting.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit</strong>: Keeps employees informed about the
latest threats and best practices, empowering them to be the first line
of defense against cyberattacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority</strong>: <strong>High</strong></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Regular Network Vulnerability Scans</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action</strong>: Schedule and execute regular,
authenticated vulnerability scans of the internal and external network
infrastructure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit</strong>: Identifies technical vulnerabilities,
misconfigurations, and outdated software/services that could be
exploited by attackers. This is crucial for a complete security posture
assessment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority</strong>: <strong>Medium</strong></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Review and Update Incident Response Plan</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action</strong>: Ensure that the organization has a
well-defined and regularly tested incident response plan to effectively
detect, contain, eradicate, and recover from cybersecurity
incidents.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit</strong>: Minimizes the impact of security
breaches and ensures business continuity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority</strong>: <strong>Medium</strong></p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The current cybersecurity posture of <strong>Atlas Mapping</strong>
demonstrates a foundational understanding of security, particularly with
MFA for key systems and initial employee training. However, the
identified gaps in MFA for computer logins and consistent annual
security awareness training represent significant risks that, if
unaddressed, could expose the organization to potential data breaches
and operational disruptions. Proactive implementation of the recommended
actions will substantially strengthen the organization’s defense
capabilities.</p>
