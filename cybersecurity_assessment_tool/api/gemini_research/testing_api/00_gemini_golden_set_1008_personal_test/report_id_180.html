<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This Cybersecurity Posture Assessment was conducted for Vertex
Solutions to evaluate its current security landscape. The assessment
incorporated organizational information and a review of self-reported
security controls.</p>
<p><strong>Important Note on Data Limitations:</strong> A significant
challenge in this assessment was the unavailability or corruption of
critical input data.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Network Scan Results:</strong> The provided network scan
data (Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON) was broken, preventing any technical
analysis of open ports, services, or potential vulnerabilities exposed
externally. The target IP for the scan could not be identified from the
input.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Current Risks Data:</strong> The provided current risks
data (Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON) was also broken, meaning no
pre-existing vulnerabilities or risk profiles could be integrated into
this report.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Due to these limitations, the scope of this report is primarily
focused on the organizational security controls as reported through the
questionnaire. A full, technical assessment of the external attack
surface and internal vulnerabilities could not be performed.</p>
<p><strong>Key Findings from Available Data:</strong> The review of
security controls identified two critical gaps:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive Data
Systems:</strong> MFA is currently not required for access to sensitive
data systems, representing a significant risk of unauthorized access if
credentials are compromised.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> The
organization lacks a formal AUP, which is fundamental for setting clear
expectations for employee conduct regarding IT resources and data, and
for establishing a baseline for security awareness.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>While other questionnaire responses indicate good practices in areas
like MFA for email and computers, and general security awareness
training, the identified gaps are serious and warrant immediate
attention.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong> Immediate actions are recommended
to address the identified security control deficiencies. Furthermore, it
is imperative to conduct a comprehensive technical vulnerability
assessment with valid input data to gain a complete understanding of the
organization’s technical risk exposure.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Analysis of Security Control Gaps:</strong> Based on the
questionnaire responses, the following critical gaps have been
identified:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA for Sensitive Data Systems (Critical Gap):</strong>
The lack of MFA for sensitive data systems significantly increases the
risk of unauthorized access. If an attacker compromises a user’s
credentials (e.g., via phishing or malware), they could gain unfettered
access to critical data without an additional authentication
factor.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Employee Acceptable Use Policy (High Risk):</strong> The
absence of an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) means there are no formal
guidelines for how employees should use company IT resources, access
data, and conduct themselves in a secure manner. This can lead to
inconsistent security practices, increased risk of data leakage, and
makes it harder to enforce security policies.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="network-vulnerability-scan-input_1_network_scan_json">Network
Vulnerability Scan (Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON)</h2>
<p><strong>Status: Data Unavailable / Corrupted</strong></p>
<p>Due to a corrupted or unavailable input file for the network scan
results (Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON), a detailed technical analysis of
Vertex Solutions’ external attack surface could not be performed.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>No scan date information is available.</p></li>
<li><p>The target of the scan could not be determined from the
input.</p></li>
<li><p>No open ports, services, products, or versions could be extracted
or analyzed.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This limitation prevents the identification of exposed services,
outdated software versions, or misconfigurations that could represent
significant vulnerabilities. A comprehensive technical assessment of
network exposure and potential entry points is therefore not possible at
this time. The target referenced in the report (where applicable) will
use <code>[Target IP]</code> to denote this missing information.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This risk assessment is primarily based on the identified gaps in
security controls from the questionnaire, given the unavailability of
technical scan data and pre-existing risk information.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="identified-risks">Identified Risks</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Risk Name: Inadequate Multi-Factor Authentication for
Sensitive Data Systems</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Overview:</strong> Vertex Solutions currently does not
require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive data
systems. This leaves critical data vulnerable to credential-based
attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Severity:</strong> <strong>High</strong> (Potential for
significant data breaches, compliance failures, and reputational
damage).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Unauthorized access to sensitive data,
data exfiltration, regulatory penalties, loss of trust.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Risk Name: Lack of Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization lacks a formal
Employee Acceptable Use Policy, leading to potential inconsistencies in
employee behavior regarding IT resource usage and data
handling.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Severity:</strong> <strong>Medium</strong> (Increased
risk of unintentional security incidents, insider threats, and legal
liabilities).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Data leakage, malware infections,
productivity loss, legal and compliance issues, inconsistent security
posture.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="limitations-of-risk-assessment">Limitations
of Risk Assessment</h2>
<p><strong>Status: Data Unavailable / Corrupted for Current Risks
(Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON)</strong></p>
<p>The input for existing vulnerabilities (Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON)
was broken. Therefore, no information regarding pre-existing risks,
historical vulnerabilities, or an established risk register could be
incorporated into this assessment. This significantly limits the ability
to correlate new findings with ongoing risk management efforts. A
complete risk profile would typically include both current and newly
identified risks.</p>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the available information and the identified security
control gaps, the following recommendations are provided to enhance
Vertex Solutions’ cybersecurity posture.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication for Sensitive Data
Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediately implement and enforce MFA
for all systems that store, process, or transmit sensitive data. This
should be prioritized to mitigate the risk of unauthorized
access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Drastically reduces the risk of
successful credential stuffing, phishing, and password brute-force
attacks against critical systems.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Create a comprehensive AUP that clearly
outlines employee responsibilities for using company IT resources, data,
and internet access. The policy should address data handling, software
installation, use of personal devices, and reporting security
incidents.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Distribute the AUP to all employees,
obtain signed acknowledgements, and integrate it into new employee
onboarding and annual security awareness training.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Establishes clear expectations, reduces
insider risk, improves overall security posture by fostering responsible
user behavior, and provides a basis for disciplinary action if policies
are violated.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct a Full Technical Vulnerability
Assessment:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Arrange for a complete and valid
external network vulnerability scan and, if possible, internal network
and application scans. Ensure all necessary input data is provided in a
correct and parsable format for a comprehensive analysis.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Identifies specific technical
weaknesses, misconfigurations, and outdated software versions that could
be exploited by attackers, providing a detailed roadmap for technical
remediation. This is crucial for a complete understanding of the attack
surface.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish a Risk Register and Management
Process:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop a formal process for
identifying, assessing, mitigating, and monitoring risks. This should
include maintaining a centralized risk register that tracks all
identified vulnerabilities, their severity, potential impact, and
mitigation status.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Provides a structured approach to risk
management, ensuring that risks are consistently evaluated and
addressed, and enables informed decision-making regarding security
investments.</p></li>
