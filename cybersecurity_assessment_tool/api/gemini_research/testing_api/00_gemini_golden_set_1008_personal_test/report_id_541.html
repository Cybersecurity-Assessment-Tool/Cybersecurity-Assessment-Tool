<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings from a cybersecurity posture
assessment for Radiant Life, conducted on <code>2025-11-22</code>. The
assessment combined a review of organizational security controls through
a questionnaire, a technical network scan, and an analysis of
pre-existing risk data.</p>
<p>Radiant Life demonstrates good foundational security practices
regarding Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across email, computer
logins, and sensitive data systems. However, several critical gaps were
identified. The organization currently lacks an employee acceptable use
policy and does not conduct security awareness training for new or
existing employees. Technically, a public-facing Nginx web server
(<code>192.168.10.5</code>) was found to be running an outdated version
(<code>1.18.0</code>), posing a potential security risk due to unpatched
vulnerabilities. Additionally, the SSL certificate on this server was
issued for <code>www.acme-corp.com</code>, which differs from the
organization’s domain.</p>
<p>Immediate recommendations focus on implementing comprehensive
security awareness training, developing an acceptable use policy, and
updating critical public-facing infrastructure.</p>

</div>
<h2 id="analysis-of-questionnaire-responses">Analysis of Questionnaire
Responses</h2>
<p>The organization has implemented strong MFA requirements across key
access points, which is an excellent security practice and significantly
reduces the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials.
However, significant deficiencies were identified regarding security
policies and employee training:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> Without a
formal AUP, employees may not be aware of their responsibilities when
using company resources. This gap can lead to inconsistent behavior,
potential misuse of IT assets, and increased risk of security incidents,
compliance violations, or legal issues.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of Security Awareness Training:</strong> The lack
of both new employee and annual security awareness training represents a
major vulnerability. Employees are often the first line of defense;
without proper education, they are highly susceptible to social
engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting, baiting) and may
inadvertently introduce malware, expose sensitive data, or fail to
follow secure operational procedures, significantly increasing the risk
of data breaches or system compromise.</p></li>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on target <code>192.168.10.5</code> on
<code>2025-11-22</code> at <code>10:00:00Z</code>. The scan identified
the following open ports and services:</p>

</div>
<h2 id="analysis-of-technical-scan">Analysis of Technical Scan</h2>
<p>The scan identified one open port, <code>443/TCP</code>, running an
HTTPS service. The server product is identified as <code>nginx</code>
version <code>1.18.0</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Outdated Nginx Version:</strong> Nginx
<code>1.18.0</code> was released in April 2020. This version is
significantly outdated; multiple security vulnerabilities (CVEs) have
been discovered and patched in subsequent releases. Running outdated
software exposes the server to known exploits, potentially leading to
unauthorized access, remote code execution, denial of service, or data
compromise. Regularly updating web servers is a critical security
practice.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>SSL Certificate Anomaly:</strong> The SSL certificate’s
common name was <code>www.acme-corp.com</code>, which differs from the
organization’s reported website domain
(<code>www.RadiantLife.net</code>). While not a direct vulnerability,
this could indicate a misconfigured certificate, a certificate issued
for a different entity (e.g., a shared hosting provider), or a potential
for trust issues if users expect to see a certificate matching the
current domain. This discrepancy should be investigated to ensure proper
configuration, ownership, and to prevent potential browser warnings or
user distrust.</p></li>

</div>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and improve the overall cybersecurity
posture of Radiant Life, the following actionable recommendations are
provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement a Comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop, disseminate, and formally enforce a clear AUP that
outlines acceptable and unacceptable use of company IT resources, data,
internet access, and communication systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all employees read, understand, and formally acknowledge
the AUP, ideally upon hiring and annually thereafter.</p></li>
<li><p>Integrate AUP review into employee onboarding and ongoing
training programs.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish a Robust Security Awareness Training
Program:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>New Employees:</strong> Mandate comprehensive security
awareness training as a critical component of the onboarding process for
all new hires before they gain access to company systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Annual Training:</strong> Conduct mandatory annual
security awareness training for all employees, covering essential topics
such as identifying phishing and social engineering attempts, strong
password hygiene, secure data handling procedures, incident reporting
protocols, and remote work best practices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Reinforcement:</strong> Supplement annual
training with regular, targeted communications, quarterly
micro-trainings, or simulated phishing exercises to keep employees
vigilant and informed about current threats.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Update and Patch Outdated Software (Nginx):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Immediately plan and execute an upgrade of the Nginx web server
on <code>192.168.10.5</code> to the latest stable version (e.g., 1.24.x
or 1.26.x). Prioritize this upgrade due to the significant security risk
posed by outdated software.</p></li>
<li><p>Establish a robust patch management program for all public-facing
and critical internal systems to ensure timely application of security
updates.</p></li>
<li><p>Prior to upgrading, ensure proper testing in a staging
environment to prevent service disruption, and maintain a clear rollback
plan.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Review and Correct SSL Certificate
Configuration:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Investigate the SSL certificate on <code>192.168.10.5</code> to
understand why its common name is
<code>www.acme-corp.com</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Replace the existing certificate with one that correctly matches
the organization’s domain (<code>www.RadiantLife.net</code>) and is
properly owned and managed by Radiant Life.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all certificates are configured to use strong encryption
protocols (e.g., TLS 1.2 or 1.3 only) and have appropriate validity
periods.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>While Radiant Life has made commendable strides in implementing
Multi-Factor Authentication, there are critical areas requiring
immediate attention in terms of security policy, employee training, and
software patching. Addressing the identified risks, particularly the
absence of security awareness training and the use of outdated
public-facing software, will significantly enhance the organization’s
defensive posture against common cyber threats and reduce the likelihood
of successful attacks. Continuous monitoring, proactive risk management,
and a culture of cybersecurity are essential for maintaining a strong
security posture in the evolving threat landscape.</p>
