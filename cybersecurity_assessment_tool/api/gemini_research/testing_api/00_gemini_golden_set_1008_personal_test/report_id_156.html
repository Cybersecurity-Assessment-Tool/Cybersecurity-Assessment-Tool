<p><em>Note: The provided network scan data (Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON)

broken. Consequently, potential technical vulnerabilities (e.g.,
outdated software, misconfigurations, unpatched systems) and any
pre-existing known organizational risks could not be assessed or
included in this report. It is highly recommended that <strong>Aetheric
Systems</strong> conducts a full technical vulnerability assessment and
penetration test to cover these unassessed areas.</em></p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">6. Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the current assessment, the following recommendations are
provided to enhance the cybersecurity posture of <strong>Aetheric
Systems</strong>. These recommendations prioritize the critical gaps
identified through the organizational questionnaire.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Access (Critical
Priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediately enforce Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for all user accounts accessing organizational
email (e.g., Microsoft 365, Google Workspace). This significantly
reduces the risk of account compromise from stolen or phished
credentials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Consideration:</strong> Evaluate various MFA methods,
including authenticator apps (e.g., Microsoft Authenticator, Google
Authenticator) and, for higher assurance, hardware security keys (e.g.,
FIDO2/WebAuthn).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Introduce Mandatory Security Awareness Training for New
Employees (High Priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop and implement a mandatory,
comprehensive security awareness training program for all new hires
during their onboarding process.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Content:</strong> This training should cover essential
topics such as phishing identification, malware prevention, strong
password hygiene, social engineering tactics, acceptable use policies,
and reporting suspicious activities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Timing:</strong> Ensure this training is completed before
new employees gain full access to sensitive systems or
information.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Regular Vulnerability Scanning and Penetration
Testing (Best Practice):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Despite the current assessment’s
limitations, it is strongly recommended that <strong>Aetheric
Systems</strong> regularly performs authenticated vulnerability scans
and external/internal penetration tests on their IT infrastructure. This
will identify technical vulnerabilities that were not assessable in this
report.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Follow-up:</strong> Prioritize patching and remediation
of identified vulnerabilities based on severity and potential
impact.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish a Robust Vulnerability Management Program (Best
Practice):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Implement a formal process for tracking,
prioritizing, and remediating vulnerabilities across all assets,
including systems, applications, and network devices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Integration:</strong> Integrate threat intelligence feeds
to stay informed about emerging threats relevant to the organization’s
technology stack and industry.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">7. Conclusion</h1>
<p><strong>Aetheric Systems</strong> demonstrates a foundational
commitment to certain security controls, particularly regarding MFA for
computer and sensitive data access, and annual security training.
However, the identified lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for email
and the absence of initial security awareness training for new employees
represent significant and exploitable vulnerabilities. Addressing these
immediate gaps, alongside implementing proactive and comprehensive
technical assessments, will substantially improve the organization’s
overall cybersecurity resilience and reduce its attack surface against
common threats.</p>
