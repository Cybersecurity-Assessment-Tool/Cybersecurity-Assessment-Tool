<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a cybersecurity posture assessment for Symmetry
Architecture, compiled from an analysis of organizational data,
responses to a security questionnaire, and a focused network scan
targeting <code>2001:db8::1</code>.</p>
<p>The assessment highlights several positive security practices,
including the mandatory use of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
email and computer logins, and an established annual security awareness
training program for all employees.</p>
<p>However, critical security gaps were identified: the lack of MFA
enforcement for systems containing sensitive data, and the absence of
dedicated security awareness training for new employees during their
onboarding process. The network scan also revealed an open SSH port (22)
on the targeted IPv6 host. While SSH is a legitimate remote access
protocol, an exposed port 22 represents a potential attack surface that
requires robust security configurations and continuous monitoring to
prevent unauthorized access and potential exploits.</p>
<p>The identified risks are categorized and detailed, followed by
actionable recommendations designed to strengthen Symmetry
Architecture’s defenses and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.</p>

exploitation if not properly secured with strong authentication,
up-to-date software, and restricted access.</p></li>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and enhance Symmetry Architecture’s
overall cybersecurity posture, the following actionable recommendations
are provided:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>R1 - Implement MFA for Sensitive Data
Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Mandate and configure Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for all applications, databases, and systems that
store, process, or transmit sensitive organizational or client
data.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Provides an additional layer of security beyond
passwords, drastically reducing the likelihood of successful
unauthorized access even if primary credentials are
compromised.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>R2 - Introduce Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Develop and integrate a comprehensive, mandatory
security awareness training program as part of the onboarding process
for all new employees. This training should cover topics such as
phishing, password hygiene, social engineering, and acceptable use
policies.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Equips new staff with essential cybersecurity
knowledge and best practices from their first day, thereby minimizing
human-related security risks and fostering a security-aware culture
across the organization.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>R3 - Harden SSH Service Configuration:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Review and strengthen the security configuration
for the SSH service on . Specific hardening measures should include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Enforcing strong, key-based authentication exclusively, and
disabling password-based logins.</p></li>
<li><p>Disabling direct root login via SSH.</p></li>
<li><p>Implementing firewall rules to restrict SSH access to only
necessary administrative IP addresses or VPN subnets.</p></li>
<li><p>Utilizing tools like ‘fail2ban‘ or similar solutions to implement
rate-limiting and automatic IP blocking for failed login
attempts.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensuring the SSH server software is kept up-to-date with the
latest security patches.</p></li>
<li><p>Configuring robust logging for SSH access and regularly
monitoring these logs for suspicious activity.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Significantly reduces the attack surface
presented by the open SSH port, protecting against brute-force attacks,
unauthorized access attempts, and exploitation of known
vulnerabilities.</p></li>
</ul></li>
