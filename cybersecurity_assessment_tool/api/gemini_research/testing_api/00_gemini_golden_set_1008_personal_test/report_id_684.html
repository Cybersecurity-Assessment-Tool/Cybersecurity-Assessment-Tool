<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">1. Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for Astraeus Aerospace, incorporating organizational data, a review of
security controls, and an attempted technical scan analysis. Due to
significant corruption and unavailability of technical scan data and
pre-existing risk information, this assessment’s technical depth is
limited, and findings are primarily derived from the self-reported
security questionnaire.</p>
<p>The primary findings indicate critical gaps in multi-factor
authentication (MFA) implementation for email and computer login,
alongside the absence of an employee acceptable use policy. These issues
represent high-severity risks that could significantly impact the
organization’s security posture if left unaddressed. While the
organization demonstrates good practices in security awareness training,
the foundational controls identified as missing warrant immediate
attention and remediation.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-control-gaps">3.1 Analysis of
Control Gaps</h2>
<p>The "No" responses highlight significant security control gaps:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA for Email Access:</strong> The absence of MFA for
email access is a severe vulnerability. Email is a primary vector for
phishing, business email compromise (BEC), and account takeover attacks.
Without MFA, compromised credentials can grant attackers full access to
communication channels, potentially leading to data breaches and
financial fraud.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>MFA for Computer Login:</strong> Not requiring MFA for
computer login significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access
to internal systems. Stolen or weak passwords can allow attackers to
gain a foothold within the network, escalate privileges, and launch
further attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> The lack
of an AUP leaves the organization vulnerable to misuse of company
resources, compliance violations, and legal liabilities. An AUP sets
clear expectations for employee conduct regarding company assets and
information, reducing the risk of accidental or malicious security
incidents.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">4. Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was intended to identify open ports, running services,
and potential vulnerabilities. However, the provided network scan data
(Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON) was found to be corrupted and incomplete.
Therefore, no technical findings regarding open ports, service versions,
or specific host-based vulnerabilities can be reported from this input.
The target of the scan, based on the provided (albeit broken) metadata,
was expected to be <code>[Target IP]</code>.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment">5. Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>The risk assessment is primarily based on the identified security
control gaps from the questionnaire, as the technical scan results and
pre-existing vulnerability data were unavailable.</p>
<div class="tabular">
<p><span>p<span>0.25</span>p<span>0.5</span>p<span>0.1</span></span>
<strong>Risk Name</strong> &amp; <strong>Overview</strong> &amp;
<strong>Severity</strong><br />
<strong>Lack of MFA for Email Access</strong> &amp; Without MFA, email
accounts are highly susceptible to credential stuffing, phishing, and
account takeover, leading to potential data breaches, BEC, and
unauthorized access to sensitive communications. &amp;
<strong>High</strong><br />
<strong>Lack of MFA for Computer Login</strong> &amp; Absence of MFA for
computer login makes endpoints vulnerable to unauthorized access via
compromised credentials, enabling lateral movement and internal system
compromise. &amp; <strong>High</strong><br />
<strong>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy</strong> &amp; Without
an AUP, employees may inadvertently or intentionally misuse company
resources, leading to data loss, security incidents, and non-compliance
with regulatory requirements. &amp; <strong>Medium</strong><br />
<strong>Unavailable Technical &amp; Pre-existing Risk Data</strong>
&amp; The inability to conduct a technical assessment or review existing
vulnerabilities due to data corruption leaves significant blind spots
regarding network-level and application-specific risks. &amp;
<strong>Medium</strong><br />

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">6. Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the identified risks and control gaps, the following
recommendations are provided to enhance Astraeus Aerospace’s
cybersecurity posture:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Access (Critical):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Immediately enable and enforce MFA for all employee email
accounts. Prioritize administrative and executive accounts.</p></li>
<li><p>Educate users on the importance of MFA and how to use it
effectively.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Login (Critical):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Roll out MFA for all computer logins, especially for devices
accessing sensitive information or critical network segments.</p></li>
<li><p>Explore solutions compatible with existing directory services
(e.g., Active Directory) and operating systems.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce an Employee Acceptable Use
Policy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Draft a comprehensive AUP that clearly defines appropriate use of
company IT resources, data handling, internet usage, and device
policies.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all employees review and sign the AUP, and provide regular
training on its contents.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct a Comprehensive Technical Vulnerability
Assessment and Penetration Test:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Given the unavailability of previous scan data, it is crucial to
perform a thorough, external, and internal vulnerability scan and a
penetration test.</p></li>
<li><p>This should identify active open ports, misconfigured services,
outdated software versions, and potential entry points for
attackers.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish a Robust Vulnerability Management
Program:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement tools and processes for continuous vulnerability
scanning and management.</p></li>
<li><p>Define clear procedures for identifying, triaging, patching, and
verifying remediation of vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p>Maintain an up-to-date inventory of all assets and their
associated risks.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Security Awareness Training
(Reinforce):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>While currently performed, continuously update and enhance
security awareness training to cover emerging threats, especially
phishing and social engineering techniques.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct simulated phishing campaigns to test employee
resilience.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>These recommendations, if implemented diligently, will significantly
mitigate the identified risks and strengthen Astraeus Aerospace’s
overall cybersecurity posture.</p>
