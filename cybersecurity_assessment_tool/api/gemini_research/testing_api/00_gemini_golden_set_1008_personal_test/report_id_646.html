<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of Skyward Bound based
on provided organizational data, a security questionnaire, and a network
scan. While no immediate external network vulnerabilities were
identified during the basic scan, significant gaps in foundational
security controls were observed through the questionnaire. Critical
areas needing immediate attention include the absence of Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and access to sensitive data
systems, as well as a lack of dedicated security awareness training for
new employees. Addressing these gaps is crucial for enhancing overall
resilience against common cyber threats and mitigating potential risks
from social engineering and credential-based attacks.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A high-level network scan was conducted against the target IP address
<code>[Target IP]</code>. The scan did not detect any open ports or
services exposed externally on this target. This could indicate a
well-secured perimeter, or that the target IP was not actively hosting
services detectable by the scan at the time. Further investigation and
authenticated internal scans would provide a more complete picture of
the internal network posture. No specific vulnerabilities related to
outdated software or dangerous configurations were identified from this
external scan.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the security questionnaire, several key
risks have been identified. No pre-existing vulnerabilities were
provided in the input data, and no technical vulnerabilities were found
during the external scan. The primary risks stem from deficiencies in
foundational security controls.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and enhance Skyward Bound’s overall
cybersecurity posture, the following recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Logins:</strong> Immediately
deploy and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all employee
computer logins, including domain or local accounts. This significantly
reduces the risk of unauthorized access even if primary credentials are
compromised, providing a crucial layer of defense.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> Extend
MFA requirements to all systems that store, process, or transmit
sensitive organizational or customer data. Prioritize these systems
based on the classification and impact level of the data they handle.
Regular audits should ensure MFA is consistently applied.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mandatory Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong> Establish a mandatory security awareness training
program for all new hires. This training should be completed prior to
granting new employees network or system access. The curriculum should
cover common threats such as phishing, social engineering, malware, and
password best practices, fostering a security-aware culture from day
one.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Network Security Scans:</strong> Implement a
schedule for regular, automated external and internal network
vulnerability scans. This proactive measure helps identify newly exposed
services, misconfigurations, outdated software versions, and other
potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by malicious
actors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Comprehensive Risk Assessment:</strong> Consider
performing a more comprehensive risk assessment, including internal
vulnerability scans, authenticated penetration testing, and a detailed
review of all existing security policies and procedures. This holistic
approach will provide a deeper understanding of the organization’s
attack surface and overall security posture.</p></li>
