Assessment Report</h1>
<p><em>Prepared by Your Cybersecurity Team</em></p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">1. Executive Summary</h2>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of Grizzly Peak, based
on a combination of self-assessment data, a network scan, and an
overview of existing risks. The organization demonstrates good practices
in several areas, including Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email
and sensitive data systems, an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), and annual
security awareness training. However, critical gaps were identified: a
lack of MFA for computer logins and the absence of dedicated security
awareness training for new employees. A network scan identified an open
SSH service on an internal IPv6 target, which requires careful
configuration to mitigate potential risks. No pre-existing
vulnerabilities were provided in the input data. Overall, Grizzly Peak
has a foundational security framework but needs to address specific
human and technical controls to enhance its resilience against common
cyber threats.</p>

<h3 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-self-assessment">Analysis of
Self-Assessment:</h3>
<p>Grizzly Peak has implemented strong controls for email and sensitive
data access via MFA, and maintains an AUP and annual security awareness
training. However, two significant gaps were identified:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins:</strong> This is a
critical security vulnerability, as compromised credentials for user
computers could lead to unauthorized network access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong> New hires are often targets for social engineering
attempts and are less familiar with organizational security policies.
Lack of initial training increases this risk.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">4. Technical Scan
Results</h2>
<p>A network scan was conducted on the specified target. The findings
are detailed below.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> No specific scan date was provided in
the input; assuming a recent scan.</p></li>

</div>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-technical-scan">Analysis of
Technical Scan:</h3>
<p>The scan identified an open port 22 (TCP) on the target system. Port
22 is commonly used for Secure Shell (SSH), a protocol used for secure
remote access. While SSH is a legitimate and necessary service in many
environments, its exposure on a network requires robust security
configurations to prevent unauthorized access. Without specific service,
product, or version information from the scan, it is not possible to
determine if outdated software is in use. However, any exposed SSH
service should be reviewed for best practices, including strong
authentication (e.g., key-based authentication, disabled password
authentication for root), rate limiting, and access restrictions.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment">5. Risk Assessment</h2>
<p>This section synthesizes the identified gaps from the self-assessment

pre-existing vulnerabilities were provided for this assessment.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">6. Recommendations</h2>
<p>Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are provided to
improve Grizzly Peak’s cybersecurity posture:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Logins (High
Priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Deploy a robust MFA solution across all user and administrative
computer logins.</p></li>
<li><p>Enforce MFA as a mandatory policy for all endpoints accessing the
corporate network or sensitive data.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Security Awareness Training for New Employees
(High Priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and implement a mandatory security awareness training
program as part of the onboarding process for all new hires.</p></li>
<li><p>This training should cover topics such as phishing, social
engineering, password hygiene, data handling, and reporting suspicious
activities.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Harden SSH Service Configuration (Medium
Priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Review the configuration of the SSH service on
<code>2001:db8::1</code> (port 22).</p></li>
<li><p>Implement key-based authentication and disable password
authentication for all users, especially root.</p></li>
<li><p>Restrict SSH access to specific trusted IP addresses or networks
where possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider changing the default SSH port (22) to a non-standard
port to reduce automated scanning attempts.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement fail2ban or similar tools to automatically block IPs
with repeated failed login attempts.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Vulnerability Scanning and Penetration Testing
(Ongoing):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Conduct regular authenticated vulnerability scans of internal and
external networks to identify configuration weaknesses and unpatched
software.</p></li>
<li><p>Schedule periodic penetration tests to simulate real-world
attacks and assess the effectiveness of security controls.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Maintain and Update Security Policies
(Ongoing):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Regularly review and update existing security policies (e.g.,
AUP) to reflect current threat landscapes and best practices.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all employees are aware of and adhere to these
policies.</p></li>
</ul></li>
