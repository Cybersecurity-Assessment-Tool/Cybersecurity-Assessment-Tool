<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">1. Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment for <strong>Orchid Isle</strong>. The assessment incorporated
a review of organizational security controls via a questionnaire, an
analysis of provided network scan data, and an evaluation of any
pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>Our analysis revealed several foundational security strengths,
including the use of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer
logins and sensitive data systems, and consistent employee security
awareness training. However, critical gaps were identified regarding
email security, specifically the absence of MFA for email access, which
poses a significant risk for credential compromise. Additionally, the
lack of an Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) represents a governance
vulnerability.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the provided network scan data was
empty, preventing a technical assessment of external facing systems. No
prior organizational vulnerabilities were provided either. Therefore,
the current risk assessment primarily focuses on the identified policy
and control gaps. Remedial actions are recommended to bolster the
organization’s overall security posture.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="organizational-information">2. Organizational
Information</h1>
<p>The following organizational details were provided for this
assessment:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Organization Name:</strong> Orchid Isle</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Email Domain:</strong>

<li><p><strong>Website Domain:</strong></p></li>

<p>A review of the provided security questionnaire responses highlights
the current state of key security controls. These controls are
foundational elements of a robust cybersecurity program.</p>

<p>The "No" responses indicate areas requiring immediate attention to
improve the organization’s security posture.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">4. Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>No active network scan data was provided for analysis, as the target
specified was empty. Therefore, no technical vulnerabilities or exposed
services could be identified from an external perspective at this time.
Future assessments would benefit greatly from comprehensive network scan
data against <code>[Target IP]</code> or other relevant external-facing
assets.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">6. Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and enhance the overall
cybersecurity posture of <strong>Orchid Isle</strong>, the following
recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
Email:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Enable and enforce MFA for all email accounts across the
organization. This is a critical control against credential-based
attacks.</p></li>
<li><p>Educate employees on the importance of MFA and how to use it
effectively.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create a clear, concise AUP that outlines employee
responsibilities regarding the use of company IT resources, internet
access, email, and data handling.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure the AUP is communicated to all employees, understood, and
signed upon hiring and annually thereafter.</p></li>
<li><p>Integrate AUP review into annual security awareness
training.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Regular External Network Vulnerability
Scans:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Regularly scan external-facing systems (e.g.,
<code>212.24.197.44</code>, ) for open ports, vulnerable services, and
outdated software versions.</p></li>
<li><p>Prioritize and remediate any identified vulnerabilities
promptly.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Periodic Security Policy Review and Updates:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Establish a schedule for reviewing and updating all security
policies, including the AUP and MFA requirements, to ensure they remain
current with best practices and evolving threat landscapes.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">7. Conclusion</h1>
<p>This assessment provides a snapshot of the current cybersecurity
posture of <strong>Orchid Isle</strong>. While several positive controls
are in place, the identified gaps, particularly concerning MFA for email
and the absence of an AUP, present notable risks. Addressing these
recommendations will significantly strengthen the organization’s defense
against common cyber threats and foster a more secure operational
environment. Continuous monitoring, regular assessments, and ongoing
employee education are vital for maintaining a strong security
posture.</p>
