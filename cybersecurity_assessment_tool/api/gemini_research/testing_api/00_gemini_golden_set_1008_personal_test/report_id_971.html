<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the current cybersecurity posture of <strong>Nova
Terra</strong>, based on a recent network scan, organizational security
questionnaire responses, and pre-existing risk data. Our analysis
indicates several critical security gaps, particularly concerning
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) implementation across key systems and
the absence of foundational security policies and training for new
employees. A single open port was identified on an internal host;
however, no detailed service information was available. Remediation of
these identified risks is crucial to enhance the overall security
resilience of the organization.</p>

<p>This section correlates findings from the questionnaire, technical
scans, and pre-existing risk data to provide a comprehensive view of the
organization’s risk landscape.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="identified-critical-gaps-from-questionnaire">4.1. Identified
Critical Gaps from Questionnaire</h2>
<p>Based on the security control review, the following critical gaps
significantly increase the organization’s risk exposure:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Email Access:</strong> Without MFA, email
accounts are highly susceptible to phishing and credential stuffing
attacks, leading to potential data breaches and business email
compromise. This represents a significant attack vector.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Computer Login:</strong> Compromised user
credentials could grant attackers unauthorized access to internal
systems and networks, potentially leading to lateral movement and
privilege escalation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> Critical
business data residing in sensitive systems is at heightened risk of
unauthorized access or exfiltration without strong authentication
layers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy:</strong>
Without clear guidelines and boundaries, employees may engage in
activities that inadvertently introduce security risks, such as using
unapproved software, accessing malicious websites, or sharing sensitive
information insecurely.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong> New hires are often prime targets for social
engineering attacks due to lack of familiarity with organizational
security protocols, creating a significant vulnerability during the
onboarding phase.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="technical-vulnerabilities">4.2. Technical
Vulnerabilities</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Open Port 22 (SSH) on :</strong> Port 22, commonly used
for SSH, was found open on the target. While ‘127.0.0.1‘ typically
refers to a loopback interface, meaning the service is only accessible
from the host itself, if this system is part of a larger network and
exposed through other means (e.g., specific network configurations, VPN
access, or if the service is bound to ‘0.0.0.0‘ and accessible from
other network interfaces), it represents a potential entry point. The
absence of detailed service information prevents a more specific
vulnerability assessment, but any open port warrants scrutiny.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="pre-existing-risks">4.3. Pre-existing
Risks</h2>
<p>The following pre-existing risks were identified:</p>
<div id="tab:existing_risks">
<table>
<caption>Pre-existing Vulnerabilities</caption>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align: left;"><strong>Risk Name</strong></th>
<th style="text-align: left;"><strong>Overview</strong></th>
<th style="text-align: left;"><strong>Severity</strong></th>

<td style="text-align: left;">Critical</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">CVSS 10.0</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p>The "Localhost Exposed" risk with a CVSS score of 10.0 is of extreme
concern. This classification suggests that a service intended for local
access on ‘127.0.0.1‘ is somehow critically exposed to a broader
network, potentially allowing full system compromise. This finding
correlates directly with the open Port 22 identified in the technical
scan.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">5. Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are provided to
improve Nova Terra’s cybersecurity posture:</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="immediate-actions-high-priority">5.1.
Immediate Actions (High Priority)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Immediately enable and enforce MFA for all email accounts across
the organization.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement MFA for all computer logins, with particular emphasis
on administrative accounts and endpoints accessing sensitive
data.</p></li>
<li><p>Deploy MFA for access to all sensitive data systems and
applications.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a clear and comprehensive AUP for employees
regarding technology usage, data handling, and internet browsing. Ensure
all employees formally acknowledge and adhere to this policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mandatory Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong> Integrate comprehensive security awareness training
into the onboarding process for all new hires to instill security best
practices from day one.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Investigate and Secure Open Port 22 on :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Determine the exact service running on Port 22 and its
purpose.</p></li>
<li><p>If SSH access is not required, ensure the service is disabled or
blocked.</p></li>
<li><p>If SSH access is necessary, implement stringent security
measures: use strong, unique passwords or, preferably, public key
authentication; disable root login; restrict access to specific IP
addresses; and ensure all SSH configurations adhere to best
practices.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Address “Localhost Exposed” Critical Risk (CVSS
10.0):</strong> Investigate the nature and scope of this critical risk
immediately. Determine how the service on ‘127.0.0.1‘ is becoming
exposed or exploitable externally. This is paramount for preventing a
potential total system compromise. Prioritize containment and
remediation.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="long-term-strategic-recommendations">5.2.
Long-term Strategic Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Regular Security Audits and Assessments:</strong> Conduct
periodic internal and external vulnerability assessments and penetration
tests to continuously identify and address new risks and validate the
effectiveness of implemented controls.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Continuous Security Awareness Program:</strong> Maintain
annual security awareness training for all employees and integrate
ongoing security reminders, simulated phishing campaigns, and topical
alerts to foster a strong security culture.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Robust Patch Management Program:</strong> Implement a
formal and proactive patch management program to ensure all operating
systems, applications, and network devices are kept up-to-date with the
latest security patches.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Comprehensive Incident Response Plan (IRP):</strong>
Develop, document, and regularly test an incident response plan to
ensure the organization can effectively detect, respond to, and recover
from security incidents in a timely manner.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Secure Data Backup and Recovery Strategy:</strong> Ensure
regular, secure, and tested backups of all critical data are performed,
stored off-site or in immutable storage, and validated for
restorability.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Nova Terra faces significant cybersecurity challenges stemming from a
lack of fundamental security controls, particularly in MFA
implementation, security policy enforcement, and new employee training.
The identified open port and pre-existing critical "Localhost Exposed"
risk further underscore the urgency for remediation. By diligently
implementing the recommended actions, Nova Terra can substantially
improve its security posture, reduce its attack surface, and enhance its
resilience against evolving cyber threats.</p>
