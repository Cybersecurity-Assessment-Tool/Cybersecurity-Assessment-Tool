<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment for Crestview Analytics, based on self-reported
organizational data. Crucially, the provided network scan data
(Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON) and existing vulnerability data
(Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON) were malformed and could not be parsed.
This significantly limits the technical scope of this assessment.</p>
<p>Based on the available organizational information, several critical
security control gaps have been identified. These include the absence of
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access, the lack of a formal
Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), and the omission of annual
security awareness training for all employees. These areas represent
high-priority risks that require immediate attention to strengthen the
organization’s overall security posture.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Due to the unavailability of technical scan
data and pre-existing vulnerability information, this assessment’s scope
is primarily focused on policy, procedure, and self-reported control
implementation. A comprehensive assessment would necessitate complete
and accurate technical data for a full external and internal risk
profile.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>The provided network scan data (Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON) was
malformed and could not be parsed. Therefore, this section cannot
provide any technical scan results related to open ports, running
services, or identified vulnerabilities on external systems.</p>
<p>A robust cybersecurity assessment critically relies on a thorough
scan of externally exposed assets. It is strongly recommended that
Crestview Analytics conduct a proper network and vulnerability scan of
its external infrastructure to identify and address potential
weaknesses. Without this data, the external attack surface remains
largely unknown.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the available organizational information and security
control review, the following risks have been identified. This
assessment is currently limited to policy and procedural gaps due to the
unavailability of technical scan data and pre-existing vulnerability
information.</p>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Lack of MFA for
Email</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Without Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
on email accounts, these accounts are highly susceptible to credential
stuffing, phishing, and brute-force attacks. A compromised email account
can lead to significant business email compromise (BEC), data
exfiltration, and serve as an initial access point for broader network
intrusion.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">High</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Absence of Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP)</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">An AUP defines acceptable behavior for
employees when using organizational IT assets and resources. Without
one, employees may unknowingly engage in risky activities (e.g.,
visiting malicious websites, downloading unauthorized software),
increasing the likelihood of security incidents, data breaches, and
non-compliance with regulatory requirements.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Medium</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Inadequate Annual Security
Awareness Training</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">While new employees receive initial
training, the lack of mandatory annual training for all employees means
that security knowledge can degrade over time, and personnel may not be
updated on new threats, evolving attack vectors, and best practices.
This oversight increases susceptibility to social engineering attacks
and general security negligence.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Medium</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Unknown External Attack
Surface</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Due to the malformed network scan data,
the organization’s external attack surface (e.g., exposed services,
vulnerable web applications, misconfigured network devices) is unknown.
This represents a significant blind spot, as critical vulnerabilities or
open ports could be exposed to the internet, posing a high risk of
unauthorized access or exploitation.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">High</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Unidentified Pre-existing
Vulnerabilities</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The lack of parseable existing
vulnerability data prevents an assessment of known weaknesses within the
environment. This means the organization may have active, unmitigated
vulnerabilities that are not being tracked or addressed, increasing
overall risk exposure.</td>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and enhance Crestview Analytics’
cybersecurity posture, the following recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
Email:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Enable and strictly enforce MFA for all organizational email
accounts immediately. This critical control dramatically reduces the
risk of email account compromise, even in cases where credentials are
stolen through phishing or other means.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement a Comprehensive Acceptable Use
Policy (AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create a clear and comprehensive AUP that outlines the acceptable
use of all company IT resources, data, and internet access.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all employees review, understand, and formally acknowledge
the AUP, ideally on an annual basis or upon policy updates.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Mandatory Annual Security Awareness Training
for All Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement a mandatory annual security awareness training program
for all employees, encompassing both new hires and existing
staff.</p></li>
<li><p>The training should be dynamic, covering current threat
landscapes (e.g., advanced phishing techniques, ransomware, social
engineering), secure browsing habits, data handling best practices, and
clear incident reporting procedures.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct a Comprehensive External Network Scan and
Vulnerability Assessment:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Immediately perform a thorough network and vulnerability scan of
all externally facing IP addresses, domains, and web applications. This
is crucial to identify open ports, running services, outdated software
versions, and potential vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p>Prioritize the remediation of any identified critical or
high-severity vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement a regular schedule for such scans (e.g., quarterly) to
maintain an up-to-date understanding of the organization’s evolving
attack surface.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Obtain and Review Existing Vulnerability
Data:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Provide accurate and parseable data regarding any known
pre-existing vulnerabilities or findings from previous assessments. This
information is vital for a holistic risk assessment and to track the
organization’s historical security posture and remediation
efforts.</p></li>
</ul></li>
