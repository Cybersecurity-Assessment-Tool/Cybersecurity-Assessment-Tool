<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">1. Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for Brimstone Manufacturing, integrating insights from an external
network scan, a self-assessment questionnaire, and a review of
pre-existing organizational risks.</p>
<p>The organization demonstrates strong commitment to essential security
controls by consistently implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
across email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. This
significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised
credentials.</p>
<p>However, key gaps were identified in security policies and training:
specifically, the absence of an Employee Acceptable Use Policy and a
lack of dedicated security awareness training for new employees. These
areas represent significant human-factor risks that could lead to
inadvertent security breaches or non-compliance.</p>
<p>From a technical perspective, the external network scan revealed a
positive outcome, detecting no open ports on the target host
<code>192.168.0.5</code>. This suggests a well-secured perimeter from
the scanned perspective, minimizing external attack surface. A
pre-existing risk concerning an "Unencrypted Web Server" on Port 80 was
noted; however, the current scan indicates this port is closed
externally, suggesting a potential internal-only issue or a resolved
external exposure.</p>
<p>Recommendations focus on addressing policy and training deficiencies,
re-validating the status of reported technical risks, and maintaining a
robust security posture through continuous vigilance.</p>

Analysis of Security Control Gaps</h2>
<p>The questionnaire highlights crucial areas of strength and
weakness:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strengths:</strong> The organization has robust MFA
implementation across multiple critical access points, which is an
excellent security practice for credential protection.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gaps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Employee Acceptable Use Policy:</strong> The absence of
an AUP leaves employees without clear guidelines on acceptable use of
company IT resources, increasing the risk of misuse, data breaches, and
non-compliance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>New Employee Security Awareness Training:</strong> While
annual training is conducted, the lack of initial training for new
employees means they may operate without foundational security knowledge
during their crucial onboarding period, making them vulnerable to social
engineering or poor security practices.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">4. Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>An Nmap network scan was performed on the target host (Scan date:
2026-01-27). The scan aimed to identify externally exposed services and
potential vulnerabilities.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="nmap-scan-summary">4.1. Nmap Scan
Summary</h2>
<ul>

<li><p><strong>Open Ports Detected:</strong> None</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="detailed-findings">4.2. Detailed
Findings</h2>
<p>The Nmap scan did not detect any open ports on the target . This is a
strong indicator of a minimal external attack surface, suggesting that
the host is either well-configured with a restrictive firewall or is not
intended to host publicly accessible services. No services, products, or
versions could be enumerated due to the absence of open ports.</p>

scans, and pre-existing risk data to provide a holistic view of the

</div>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="detailed-risk-analysis">5.1. Detailed Risk
Analysis</h2>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="high-risks">5.1.1. High Risks</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong>
Without a formal AUP, employees may inadvertently or intentionally
misuse company IT assets, leading to data loss, malware infections, or
legal/compliance issues. This exposes the organization to operational
disruption and reputational damage.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of New Employee Security Awareness
Training:</strong> New hires represent a significant attack vector if
not properly educated on security best practices from day one. They are
more susceptible to phishing, social engineering, and can introduce
vulnerabilities through poor password hygiene or unauthorized software
installations, increasing the likelihood of a security
incident.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="medium-risks">5.1.2. Medium Risks</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Unencrypted Web Server:</strong> This pre-existing risk
report indicates an issue where Port 80 (typically HTTP) is or was
configured to be open without encryption. While the recent Nmap scan did
not detect Port 80 as open externally, this discrepancy warrants further
investigation. If this server hosts internal applications, unencrypted
internal traffic is still a concern, potentially allowing sensitive data
to be intercepted within the network. If it was previously external,
it’s positive that it’s now closed, but the reported risk suggests a
past or potential future exposure.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="low-risks-positive-findings">5.1.3. Low Risks
/ Positive Findings</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>No Open Ports Detected (External Scan):</strong> The Nmap
scan’s finding of no open ports on the target is a significant positive.
It indicates that the external attack surface for this host is minimal
or non-existent, reducing the avenues for external adversaries to gain
initial access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Strong MFA Implementation:</strong> The widespread use of
MFA across critical systems dramatically enhances credential security,
making it much harder for attackers to compromise user accounts even if
passwords are stolen.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">6. Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following recommendations are provided to mitigate identified
risks and further enhance Brimstone Manufacturing’s cybersecurity
posture.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Draft a clear, concise AUP outlining employee responsibilities,
prohibited activities, and consequences of non-compliance.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all employees read, understand, and sign the AUP upon
hiring and periodically thereafter.</p></li>
<li><p>Integrate the AUP into the annual security awareness
training.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Institute Mandatory Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop an onboarding security training module that all new hires
must complete within their first week.</p></li>
<li><p>Cover fundamental topics such as phishing, password hygiene, data
handling, incident reporting, and the importance of the AUP.</p></li>
<li><p>Reinforce this training with the existing annual security
awareness program.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Investigate and Remediate "Unencrypted Web Server"
Risk:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Verify Status:</strong> Confirm whether Port 80 on the
affected system is truly closed, both externally and internally.
Reconcile this finding with the previous risk assessment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Internal Exposure:</strong> If the server is for internal
use, evaluate if sensitive data is transmitted over unencrypted HTTP.
Implement HTTPS with valid certificates for all internal web
applications handling sensitive information.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>External Exposure (if applicable):</strong> If this risk
refers to an external-facing server, ensure it is fully migrated to
HTTPS (Port 443) with HSTS enabled, and Port 80 redirects to 443 or is
completely closed if not needed for redirection.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Maintain and Periodically Review Network Segmentation and
Firewall Rules:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Given the positive scan results (no open ports), continue to
enforce strict firewall rules and network segmentation.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct regular audits of firewall configurations to ensure only
necessary ports and services are accessible, and unnecessary ones remain
closed.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Regular Vulnerability Scanning and Penetration
Testing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement a schedule for internal and external vulnerability
scans to proactively identify new exposures.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider periodic penetration testing to simulate real-world
attacks and assess the effectiveness of security controls beyond
automated scans.</p></li>
