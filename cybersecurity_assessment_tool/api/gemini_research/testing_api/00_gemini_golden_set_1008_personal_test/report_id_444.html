<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture assessment for Oasis
Wellness, based on provided organizational data and a limited attempt to
gather technical insights. The current posture is assessed as
<strong>Moderate to High Risk</strong>, primarily due to significant
gaps in fundamental security controls identified through the
organizational questionnaire. Critical findings include the lack of
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer access, and the
absence of an employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP).</p>
<p>A major limitation of this assessment is the complete unavailability
of technical network scan data (Input 1) and pre-existing vulnerability
information (Input 3). This lack of visibility prevents a comprehensive
understanding of the external attack surface and internal system
vulnerabilities, thus introducing significant unquantified risk.
Immediate recommendations focus on implementing critical security
controls and initiating comprehensive technical scanning to gain
necessary visibility.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-controls">Analysis of Controls</h2>
<p>The questionnaire results reveal critical vulnerabilities in Oasis
Wellness’s security posture:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Email and Computer Access:</strong> The
absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for both email and computer
logins represents a severe risk. Phishing attacks are a primary vector
for credential compromise, and without MFA, a stolen password is often
sufficient for an attacker to gain access, leading to data breaches,
ransomware, or business email compromise. While MFA is used for
sensitive data systems, the wider scope of email and general computer
access remains exposed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong>
A formal AUP is crucial for defining acceptable conduct regarding the
use of organizational IT resources. Its absence can lead to inconsistent
employee behavior, increased risk of data leakage, malware infections,
and legal liabilities. Without clear guidelines, employees may
unknowingly engage in risky activities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Positive Security Awareness Training:</strong> It is
commendable that Oasis Wellness conducts security awareness training for
both new and existing employees annually. This is a critical component
of a strong security culture and helps mitigate human-factor
risks.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The provided network scan data (Input 1) was <strong>broken and
unparsable</strong>. Consequently, no technical findings regarding the
external attack surface, open ports, identified services, or potential
vulnerabilities could be extracted or analyzed from this input.</p>
<h2 id="impact-of-missing-data">Impact of Missing Data</h2>
<p>The inability to process the network scan data means that this report
cannot provide insights into:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The external services exposed by Oasis Wellness.</p></li>
<li><p>The specific software products and versions running on publicly
accessible ports.</p></li>
<li><p>Any known vulnerabilities (e.g., outdated software,
misconfigurations) present on external-facing systems.</p></li>
<li><p>The overall attack surface presented by the organization’s public
IP address.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This represents a significant visibility gap and introduces
unquantified technical risk. A comprehensive network scan is essential
to understand and address potential entry points for attackers.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the available information, the following risks have been
identified. The absence of parsable network scan data and pre-existing
vulnerability lists means that this risk assessment is incomplete and
primarily derived from the organizational security questionnaire.</p>

<h2 id="impact-of-missing-data-on-risk-assessment">Impact of Missing
Data on Risk Assessment</h2>
<p>The input for existing vulnerabilities (Input 3) was also
<strong>broken and unparsable</strong>. Therefore, no pre-existing
vulnerabilities or risks reported by the organization could be included
in this assessment. This, combined with the lack of network scan data,
means the full spectrum of Oasis Wellness’s risk exposure remains
largely unknown. There is a high likelihood of additional unlisted
technical and process-based risks that could only be identified through
further assessment.</p>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and improve the overall cybersecurity
posture of Oasis Wellness, the following recommendations are provided,
prioritized by severity and impact.</p>
