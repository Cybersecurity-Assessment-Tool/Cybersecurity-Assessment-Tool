<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment conducted for Solaris Energy. The assessment involved
analyzing organizational data, recent network scan results, and existing
risk registers. While Solaris Energy demonstrates strong controls in
some areas, particularly regarding Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
implementation, critical gaps and high-severity technical
vulnerabilities have been identified.</p>
<p>The most significant technical risk identified is an End-of-Life
(EOL) MySQL server (version 5.7.33) exposed on port 3306 to the network.
This unpatched and unsupported database presents a severe risk of data
compromise. Additionally, critical organizational deficiencies include
the absence of an Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and a lack of
security awareness training for new employees, both of which increase
the overall risk of human-error-induced incidents.</p>
<p>Immediate action is recommended to mitigate the exposed EOL database
and establish fundamental security policies and training programs to
bolster the organization’s defense against cyber threats.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-questionnaire-responses">Analysis of Questionnaire
Responses</h2>
<p>Solaris Energy has commendably implemented Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) across critical access points, including email,
computer logins, and sensitive data systems. This significantly enhances
protection against unauthorized access due to compromised
credentials.</p>
<p>However, two critical gaps were identified:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Absence of an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Without an AUP, employees lack clear guidelines on the
appropriate use of company IT resources, potentially leading to misuse,
data leakage, and increased susceptibility to cyber threats.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong> While annual training is conducted for all
employees, the absence of initial security awareness training for new
hires means that new staff might operate without fundamental security
knowledge during a critical onboarding period, making them immediate
targets for social engineering and other attacks.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on the internal target
<code>172.16.50.20</code>. The scan identified the following open port
and service:</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of Technical
Findings</h2>
<p>The most significant technical finding is the exposure of a MySQL
database server (version 5.7.33) on port 3306. MySQL 5.7 reached its
End-of-Life (EOL) in October 2023. This means it no longer receives
security updates, patches, or bug fixes from Oracle.</p>
<p>An EOL software, especially a database accessible on the network,
poses an extreme risk. Any newly discovered vulnerabilities in MySQL 5.7
will not be patched, leaving the system permanently vulnerable to
exploitation. Given that this port is open, the database could be
susceptible to various attacks, including brute-force attempts,
credential stuffing, SQL injection (if the application layer is also
vulnerable), and direct exploitation of unpatched vulnerabilities,
leading to data theft, corruption, or denial of service.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the assessment, the following recommendations are provided
to improve Solaris Energy’s cybersecurity posture:</p>
<h2 id="immediate-technical-remediation">Immediate Technical
Remediation</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Restrict Access to MySQL Port 3306:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement strict firewall rules to limit access to port 3306
(MySQL) from external networks and only allow connections from trusted
internal IP addresses or specific application servers.</p></li>
<li><p>For remote administration, mandate the use of a Virtual Private
Network (VPN) or SSH tunneling, rather than direct exposure.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade/Migrate EOL MySQL Server:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Prioritize upgrading the MySQL database to a currently supported
version (e.g., MySQL 8.0 or newer). Plan for compatibility testing and a
controlled migration process.</p></li>
<li><p>Alternatively, consider migrating the database to a managed cloud
database service that handles patching and updates
automatically.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Patching and Vulnerability
Management:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Establish a robust patch management program for all software,
operating systems, and applications to ensure timely application of
security updates.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing
to proactively identify and address weaknesses.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="organizational-security-enhancements">Organizational Security
Enhancements</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create a clear, comprehensive AUP outlining expectations for
employees regarding the use of company IT assets, internet, email, and
data handling.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all employees read, understand, and formally acknowledge
the AUP, ideally during onboarding and annually thereafter.</p></li>
<li><p>Incorporate the AUP into regular security awareness
training.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Mandatory New Employee Security Awareness
Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Integrate security awareness training as a mandatory component of
the new employee onboarding process.</p></li>
<li><p>This training should cover essential topics such as phishing
recognition, password hygiene, data classification, incident reporting
procedures, and adherence to the AUP.</p></li>
<li><p>Complement this with the existing annual security awareness
training for all employees.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Solaris Energy has demonstrated a commitment to foundational security
measures like MFA, which is commendable. However, the identified EOL
MySQL server poses an immediate and severe technical risk that requires
urgent attention. Furthermore, the absence of an AUP and initial
security training for new employees represents significant
organizational weaknesses that increase the likelihood and impact of
security incidents. By addressing these critical areas proactively,
Solaris Energy can significantly enhance its overall cybersecurity
posture and resilience against emerging threats.</p>
