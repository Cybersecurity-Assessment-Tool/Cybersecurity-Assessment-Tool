<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings from a cybersecurity posture
assessment conducted for Cloud Nine Software. The assessment involved
reviewing organizational security controls, analyzing network scan
results, and considering existing known risks.</p>
<p>Overall, Cloud Nine Software demonstrates a mixed security posture.
Strengths include the implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) for email and sensitive data systems, as well as security
awareness training for new employees. However, significant critical gaps
were identified, notably the lack of MFA for computer logins, the
absence of an Employee Acceptable Use Policy, and the omission of annual
security awareness training for all employees. Furthermore, technical
analysis revealed an outdated web server version exposed to the
internet, presenting a potential attack surface. Addressing these areas
of concern is crucial for enhancing the organization’s overall security
resilience and reducing its risk profile.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following information was gathered during the assessment to

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed to identify open ports, services, and
software versions accessible on the specified target.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Target:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> November 22, 2025, 10:00 UTC</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="detailed-findings">Detailed Findings</h2>
<p>The scan identified the following open port and service:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 443 (HTTPS):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Service Name:</strong> <code>https</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Product:</strong> <code>nginx</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Version:</strong> <code>1.18.0</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>SSL Certificate Common Name:</strong>
<code>www.acme-corp.com</code></p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="technical-analysis">Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>The Nginx web server detected on port 443 with version
<code>1.18.0</code> is an older stable release (initially released in
April 2020). Modern Nginx stable branches are significantly higher
(e.g., 1.24.x or 1.26.x). Running an outdated version of server software
increases the risk of known vulnerabilities being present and
exploitable.</p>
<p>Additionally, the SSL certificate’s common name,
<code>www.acme-corp.com</code>, does not appear to align with the
organization name <code>Cloud Nine Software</code> or its primary domain
<code>CloudNineSoftware.net</code>. This could indicate a
misconfiguration, a shared hosting environment, or an
expired/incorrectly issued certificate, which can lead to trust issues
and warnings for users.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the combined analysis of organizational controls, technical
scan results, and a review of current risks (none provided externally),
the following risks have been identified:</p>

<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
for Computer Logins</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Without MFA, compromised user credentials
(e.g., via phishing) can grant attackers direct access to internal
systems and sensitive data. This is a critical control gap.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Absence of an Employee Acceptable Use
Policy (AUP)</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">A lack of clear guidelines for employee
conduct regarding IT resource usage, data handling, and internet

</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">No Annual Security Awareness Training for
All Employees</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Employees are frequently targeted by
social engineering and phishing attacks. Without regular, comprehensive
training, the workforce’s ability to identify and respond to threats
diminishes, increasing organizational susceptibility.</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">High</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Outdated Nginx Web Server (v1.18.0)</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The Nginx web server running version
1.18.0 is outdated. Older software versions often contain known
vulnerabilities that have been patched in newer releases. This presents
a direct attack surface for potential exploitation.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">SSL Certificate Common Name Mismatch</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The SSL certificate’s common name
(<code>www.acme-corp.com</code>) does not match the organization’s
domain. This can lead to browser warnings for users, undermine trust,
and may indicate a misconfiguration or an untrusted third-party
certificate.</td>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and enhance the overall
cybersecurity posture of Cloud Nine Software, the following
recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for All
Computer Logins:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Deploy a robust MFA solution for all user accounts accessing
company computers and internal networks. This significantly reduces the
risk of credential theft leading to unauthorized access.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create a comprehensive AUP that clearly outlines employee
responsibilities for using company IT resources, data protection,
internet usage, and prohibited activities. Ensure all employees read,
understand, and sign the policy.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Annual Security Awareness Training for All
Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement a mandatory, annual security awareness training program
for all employees, not just new hires. This training should cover
current threat landscapes, phishing, social engineering, data handling
best practices, and incident reporting procedures.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Update Nginx Web Server to the Latest Stable
Version:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Plan and execute an upgrade of the Nginx web server on to the
latest stable and supported version. Prioritize this upgrade to address
known vulnerabilities present in older versions. Ensure proper testing
is conducted before deployment to production.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Review and Correct SSL Certificate
Configuration:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Investigate the SSL certificate deployed on the web server.
Ensure that the certificate’s common name (and Subject Alternative
Names) accurately reflects the domain(s) used by Cloud Nine Software ().
Obtain and deploy a valid certificate from a trusted Certificate
Authority (CA).</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>By diligently implementing these recommendations, Cloud Nine Software
can significantly strengthen its defenses against common cyber threats
and foster a more secure operating environment.</p>
