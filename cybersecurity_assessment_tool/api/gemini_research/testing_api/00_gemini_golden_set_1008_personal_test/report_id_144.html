<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture assessment for Tidal
Wave Sports, based on organizational data, a security questionnaire, and
an attempt to analyze technical scan data and pre-existing risks. While
the organization demonstrates strong foundational controls such as
security awareness training and an acceptable use policy, a critical gap
has been identified regarding Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
computer logins.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the comprehensiveness of this assessment
was limited due to issues with the provided data inputs. Specifically,
the network scan results (<code>Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON</code>) and
the list of current risks (<code>Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON</code>) were
both broken or incomplete, preventing a full technical analysis and
correlation with existing vulnerabilities. Recommendations are provided
to address identified gaps and improve the overall security posture,
emphasizing the importance of a complete data set for future
assessments.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-security-controls">Analysis of Security
Controls</h2>
<p>The organization demonstrates a commendable commitment to several
security fundamentals, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> MFA is
employed for email access and sensitive data systems, which is a strong
protective measure against unauthorized access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Policies &amp; Training:</strong> The presence of an
employee acceptable use policy and regular security awareness training
for all employees (including new hires) indicates a proactive approach
to human-centric security risks.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>However, a critical gap has been identified:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA for Computer Logins:</strong> The lack of MFA for
computer logins represents a significant vulnerability. If an attacker
compromises a user’s credentials (e.g., via phishing), they could gain
direct access to internal systems without an additional authentication
factor, increasing the risk of lateral movement and data
exfiltration.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An attempt was made to analyze the provided network scan data
(<code>Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON</code>) for the target . However, the
input data was found to be broken or incomplete.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not available due to broken input
data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports and Services:</strong> No information
available.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Products and Versions:</strong> No information
available.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Due to these limitations, a comprehensive technical vulnerability
assessment could not be performed. It is crucial for future assessments
to receive complete and valid network scan data to accurately identify
and evaluate externally exposed services, potential misconfigurations,
and outdated software versions.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section summarizes the identified risks based on the available
data. It must be noted that the <code>Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON</code>
was broken, preventing the inclusion of any pre-existing organizational
risks in this assessment.</p>

Logins (Critical Priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediately deploy and enforce MFA for
all user logins to company computers and endpoints, especially those
accessing internal networks or sensitive data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Significantly reduces the risk of
credential theft leading to unauthorized access, even if passwords are
compromised.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Timeline:</strong> Short-term (within 30-60
days).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Provide Complete Network Scan Data for Re-Assessment
(High Priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Conduct a new, comprehensive network
scan (both external and internal, if applicable) and provide the
complete, uncorrupted scan results for detailed analysis.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Enables a thorough understanding of the
organization’s technical attack surface, identifying open ports,
services, and software versions that may harbor
vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Timeline:</strong> Short-term (as soon as
possible).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Submit Complete Current Risk Register Data (High
Priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Provide an up-to-date and complete list
of all known vulnerabilities, risks, and audit findings the organization
is currently tracking.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Allows for a comprehensive correlation
of technical findings with existing known issues and helps prioritize
remediation efforts based on the organization’s established risk
tolerance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Timeline:</strong> Short-term (as soon as
possible).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Security Awareness Training Reinforcement
(Ongoing):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Continue and expand security awareness
training, with particular emphasis on the importance of MFA, phishing
recognition, and strong password practices, even with MFA in
place.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Maintains a strong human firewall and
keeps employees vigilant against evolving threats.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Timeline:</strong> Ongoing, regular intervals.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Security Audits and Vulnerability Management
(Ongoing):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Establish a schedule for regular
internal and external vulnerability assessments, penetration testing,
and security configuration reviews.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Proactively identifies new weaknesses
as the IT environment evolves and ensures continuous improvement in the
security posture.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Timeline:</strong> Ongoing, typically quarterly or
annually.</p></li>
