<h2 id="analysis-of-questionnaire-results">Analysis of Questionnaire
Results</h2>
<p>The questionnaire responses indicate several critical
deficiencies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA Gaps:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is
not required for accessing email or logging into computers. This
represents a significant vulnerability, as compromised credentials could
lead to unauthorized access to critical systems and data. While MFA is
used for sensitive data systems, its absence in general access points
severely weakens the overall security perimeter.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Policy Deficiencies:</strong> The absence of an employee
acceptable use policy (AUP) leaves the organization exposed to various
insider threats and misuse of company resources. An AUP sets clear
expectations for employee conduct regarding technology use, data
handling, and security.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Training Gaps:</strong> Although new employees receive
security awareness training, the lack of annual training for all
employees means that knowledge may become outdated, and new threats or
policies may not be effectively communicated. Ongoing training is
crucial for maintaining a strong human firewall.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on the target
<code>192.168.0.5</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not provided in scan
metadata.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports and Services:</strong> The network scan did
not identify any open ports on the target <code>192.168.0.5</code>.
Specifically, Port 80 was scanned and reported as <code>closed</code>.
This indicates that, at the time of the scan, no publicly accessible
services were running on standard ports on this particular internal
host.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section consolidates the findings into a comprehensive risk
assessment, combining critical gaps from the security control review
with pre-existing risks and technical observations.</p>
<h2 id="identified-risks-from-security-control-review">Identified Risks
from Security Control Review</h2>
<p>The following high-priority risks were identified based on the
questionnaire responses:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Email Access (High Severity):</strong>
Without MFA, email accounts are highly susceptible to credential
stuffing, phishing, and brute-force attacks. Compromised email accounts
can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and
further network intrusion.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Computer Login (High Severity):</strong>
Similar to email, a lack of MFA for computer logins increases the risk
of unauthorized access to workstations and internal network resources,
especially in scenarios involving lost or stolen devices, or compromised
user credentials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (Medium
Severity):</strong> Without a formal AUP, employees may inadvertently or
intentionally engage in activities that expose the organization to
legal, reputational, or security risks. This lack of clear guidelines
can lead to inconsistent behavior and difficulty in enforcing security
standards.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Annual Security Awareness Training (Medium
Severity):</strong> While initial training is beneficial, the absence of
regular, annual training means employees may not be up-to-date on the
latest threats, phishing techniques, or organizational security
policies. This increases the likelihood of human error leading to
security incidents.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pre-existing-risks-and-technical-discrepancies">Pre-Existing
Risks and Technical Discrepancies</h2>
<p>The organization provided information on pre-existing
vulnerabilities, which include:</p>
<div id="tab:pre_existing_risks">
<table>
<caption>Pre-Existing Vulnerabilities (from Input 3)</caption>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align: left;"><strong>Risk Name</strong></th>
<th style="text-align: left;"><strong>Overview</strong></th>
<th style="text-align: center;"><strong>Severity (CVSS
Score)</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Unencrypted Web Server</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Port 80 is open.</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">5.0</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p><strong>Discrepancy Note:</strong> The pre-existing risk "Unencrypted
Web Server" is listed with an overview stating "Port 80 is open."
However, the current network scan of explicitly reported Port 80 as
<code>closed</code>. This indicates a potential discrepancy between the
organization’s recorded risks and the current technical state. It is
crucial to verify the current status of any web server believed to be
running on Port 80 within the organization’s network and update risk
registers accordingly. If Port 80 is indeed open on another host or
external interface, the risk of unencrypted communication remains
relevant.</p>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are provided to
enhance Willow Creek Health’s cybersecurity posture:</p>
<h2 id="policy-training-and-human-factors">Policy, Training, and Human
Factors</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Universally:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>For Email Access:</strong> Mandate MFA for all email
accounts. This significantly reduces the risk of email
compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>For Computer Login:</strong> Implement MFA for all user
logins to company computers and workstations, especially for those
accessing sensitive data or administrative privileges.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a comprehensive AUP that clearly outlines
employee responsibilities and permissible uses of company IT resources,
data, and communication systems. Ensure all employees read, understand,
and acknowledge this policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Regular Security Awareness Training:</strong>
Beyond initial onboarding, implement mandatory annual (or bi-annual)
security awareness training for all employees. Training should cover
current threats, phishing recognition, data handling best practices, and
organizational security policies.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="technical-and-risk-management">Technical and Risk
Management</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Verify Port 80 Status:</strong> Investigate the
discrepancy regarding "Unencrypted Web Server" risk. Confirm whether
Port 80 is open on any critical system or external interface within the
organizational network.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If Port 80 is found to be open and serving content, it should be
immediately protected by enforcing HTTPS (SSL/TLS encryption) and
redirecting all HTTP traffic to HTTPS.</p></li>
<li><p>If Port 80 is not required, ensure it is properly closed and
filtered at the firewall level.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Vulnerability Assessments:</strong> Conduct
periodic vulnerability scans and penetration tests on both internal and
external assets to identify and remediate technical weaknesses
proactively.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Maintain an Accurate Risk Register:</strong> Ensure the
organization’s risk register is regularly reviewed and updated to
reflect the current state of assets, vulnerabilities, and threats. This
includes verifying pre-existing risks against current scan data and
operational status.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Willow Creek Health demonstrates a foundational understanding of
security by implementing MFA for sensitive data systems and initial
employee training. However, significant weaknesses exist in the broader
application of MFA, policy enforcement, and continuous security
education. Addressing these gaps, particularly the implementation of MFA
for email and computer access, alongside robust policies and ongoing
training, will substantially uplift the organization’s overall
cybersecurity posture and resilience against common threats. Proactive
verification of recorded risks against current technical scans is also
crucial for an accurate security overview.</p>
