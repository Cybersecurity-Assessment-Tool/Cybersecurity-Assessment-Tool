<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>Terraform Global currently exhibits a cybersecurity posture with
significant procedural and control gaps, primarily identified through
its internal security questionnaire. Key areas of concern include the
critical absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer
logins and sensitive data systems, alongside a complete lack of
consistent security awareness training for employees. It is important to
note that a full technical risk assessment was not possible for this
report, as both comprehensive network scan data and existing

<h2 id="analysis-of-questionnaire-findings">Analysis of Questionnaire
Findings</h2>
<p>The questionnaire responses highlight critical weaknesses in
Terraform Global’s current security posture:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA Gaps (High Risk):</strong> The absence of MFA for
computer logins and sensitive data systems is a severe vulnerability.
Compromised credentials (e.g., through phishing) could grant an attacker
easy access to internal networks and critical data without an additional
layer of verification.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Security Awareness Training (High Risk):</strong>
The complete lack of formal security awareness training for both new and
existing employees significantly increases the organization’s
susceptibility to human-centric attacks such as phishing, social
engineering, and malware delivery. Employees who are not regularly
trained are more likely to make errors that lead to security
incidents.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Positive Controls:</strong> The implementation of MFA for
email access and an acceptable use policy are positive foundational
steps. However, these controls do not adequately address the broader and
more critical risks identified regarding internal system access and
employee education.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<h2 id="network-scan-findings-for">Network Scan Findings for </h2>
<p><em>Due to technical issues, the provided network scan data
(Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON) was explicitly marked as broken and could
not be processed. Therefore, a detailed analysis of open ports,
services, products, and versions cannot be presented at this
time.</em></p>
<p><em>If the scan data were available, this section would typically
include:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> The timestamp of when the network
scan was performed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Target IP/Hostname:</strong> The specific target(s) of
the scan.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports and Services:</strong> A comprehensive list of
all identified open ports, the services running on them (e.g., HTTP,
SMB, SSH), and their associated products and versions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Vulnerability Identification:</strong> Detection of
outdated software, common misconfigurations, or known vulnerabilities
linked to the identified services and applications.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Potential Attack Vectors:</strong> An assessment of
potential entry points and exploitation pathways based on the discovered
network services and their configurations.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p><em>Due to the unavailability of comprehensive technical scan data
(Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON) and existing vulnerabilities data
(Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON), this risk assessment primarily focuses on
the organizational and procedural gaps identified through the security
questionnaire.</em></p>
<h2 id="identified-critical-risks">Identified Critical Risks</h2>
<p>The primary risks identified in this assessment stem from the
procedural and control deficiencies:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins (Severity:
High)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Overview:</em> Without MFA, an attacker only needs a single
set of compromised credentials to gain initial access to an employee’s
workstation. This often leads to lateral movement within the network,
privilege escalation, and access to sensitive resources.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Impact:</em> Unauthorized system access, data exfiltration,
malware propagation (e.g., ransomware), and disruption of
operations.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems (Severity:
High)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Overview:</em> Direct access to systems containing or
processing sensitive data without MFA leaves these critical assets
highly vulnerable. If an attacker bypasses perimeter defenses or obtains
credentials, there is no secondary control to prevent access.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Impact:</em> Severe data breaches (confidentiality,
integrity, availability loss), regulatory non-compliance, financial
penalties, and reputational damage.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>No Security Awareness Training (Severity:
High)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Overview:</em> Employees are often the weakest link in a
security chain. Without regular training on current threats like
phishing, social engineering, and safe data handling practices,
employees are more prone to making errors that can compromise
security.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Impact:</em> Increased susceptibility to social engineering
attacks, malware infections, credential theft, and accidental data
exposure.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="risk-correlation">Risk Correlation</h2>
<p>Typically, a comprehensive risk assessment would correlate findings
from the questionnaire, technical scans, and existing vulnerability
databases. For instance, an outdated, internet-facing server (technical
finding) combined with a lack of employee training (organizational risk)
could create a scenario where an attacker exploits the server and then
uses stolen credentials (via social engineering) to gain deeper,
undetected access. The current limitations prevent such a detailed
correlation.</p>
<h2 id="existing-vulnerabilities">Existing Vulnerabilities</h2>
<p><em>Due to technical issues, the provided existing vulnerabilities
data (Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON) was explicitly marked as broken and
could not be processed. Therefore, a detailed analysis of pre-existing
risks within Terraform Global’s environment cannot be presented at this
time.</em></p>
<p><em>If the data were available, this section would typically include
a summary table detailing:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Risk Name:</strong> The specific identifier or common
name of the vulnerability (e.g., "SQL Injection", "Unpatched
OS").</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Overview:</strong> A brief description of the
vulnerability and its potential consequences.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Severity:</strong> The assessed impact level (e.g.,
Critical, High, Medium, Low) based on CVSS or similar
frameworks.</p></li>
</ul>
