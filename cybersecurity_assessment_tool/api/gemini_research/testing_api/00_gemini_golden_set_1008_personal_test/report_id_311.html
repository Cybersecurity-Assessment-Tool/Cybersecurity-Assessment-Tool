<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive assessment of <strong>Vertex
Solutions</strong>’s current cybersecurity posture, synthesizing
information from a network scan, organizational security questionnaire
responses, and pre-existing risk data. The analysis reveals several
critical vulnerabilities and significant gaps in foundational security
controls. Key findings include insufficient Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) coverage, a notable absence of an employee acceptable use policy,
and a lack of security awareness training for new employees.
Furthermore, an Nmap scan confirmed an open SSH service on the internal
loopback address, corroborating a pre-existing critical risk regarding
"Localhost Exposed". Addressing these areas is paramount to enhancing
<strong>Vertex Solutions</strong>’s resilience against cyber threats and
protecting sensitive assets. Immediate and long-term recommendations are
provided to guide strategic improvements.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-questionnaire-gaps">Analysis of Questionnaire
Gaps</h2>
<p>The questionnaire responses reveal several critical gaps:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Insufficient MFA Coverage:</strong> Multi-Factor
Authentication is not required for accessing email or logging into
computers. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access
through credential theft.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Missing Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> The absence
of an AUP leaves a critical void in defining expected employee behavior
regarding technology use, potentially leading to misuse or unintentional
security incidents.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of New Employee Security Training:</strong> New
employees are not receiving security awareness training, making them
immediate targets for social engineering attacks and potentially unaware
of organizational security protocols.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed to identify open ports and services on
the specified target.</p>
<h2 id="target">Target: </h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not provided in scan
metadata.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> Up</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Port 22/tcp:</strong> Open (Service: SSH)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Product/Version Information:</strong> Not identified by
the scan.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of Technical
Findings</h2>
<p>The Nmap scan, though limited in scope to the loopback address,
confirms an open SSH service (Port 22) on . While SSH is a legitimate
service, its presence on an exposed or poorly configured internal system
can pose a risk. Without service version information, it is impossible
to determine if the SSH daemon is running an outdated or vulnerable
version. However, its presence directly correlates with an existing
critical risk as detailed in the next section.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes pre-existing vulnerabilities, questionnaire
gaps, and technical findings into a comprehensive risk overview.</p>
<h2 id="identified-risks-from-input-data">Identified Risks (from Input

<p>The following risk was pre-identified:</p>

<p>This risk specifically affects and indicates a critical internal
exposure.</p>
<h2 id="correlated-risks-and-gaps">Correlated Risks and Gaps</h2>
<p>Combining all data points, the following critical risks and gaps have
been identified:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>High Risk: Inadequate Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Coverage.</strong> The absence of MFA for email and computer logins
creates significant attack vectors for credential stuffing, phishing,
and brute-force attacks. This is a fundamental security control often
targeted by adversaries.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Critical Gap: Non-existent Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP).</strong> Without a clear AUP, employees lack guidance on the
responsible and secure use of organizational IT resources. This
increases the likelihood of human error, data leakage, and compliance
issues.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Critical Gap: Deficient Security Awareness Training for
New Hires.</strong> The lack of initial security awareness training
means new employees are not equipped to recognize and respond to common
cyber threats from day one, posing an immediate insider risk.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Critical Risk: Unsecured/Unassessed SSH Service on
Localhost.</strong> The Nmap scan confirmed an open SSH service on .
This finding directly validates the "Localhost Exposed" pre-existing
risk. While loopback, such a service might be leveraged through other
attack vectors if not properly secured, configured, and monitored. The
lack of version information prevents an immediate assessment of known
vulnerabilities.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To significantly enhance <strong>Vertex Solutions</strong>’s
cybersecurity posture, the following recommendations are provided,
categorized into immediate actions and long-term strategic
improvements.</p>
<h2 id="immediate-actions">Immediate Actions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for All Critical Systems:</strong> Mandate
Multi-Factor Authentication for all email access and computer logins.
Prioritize deployment across the entire organization.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a comprehensive AUP outlining the responsible use
of company IT assets. All employees must review, understand, and
formally acknowledge this policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mandate New Employee Security Awareness
Training:</strong> Institute compulsory security awareness training for
all new hires before they gain access to company systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Investigate and Secure Localhost SSH
Service:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Determine the purpose of the SSH service running on .</p></li>
<li><p>If essential, secure the service by:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Disabling root login.</p></li>
<li><p>Using strong, key-based authentication instead of
passwords.</p></li>
<li><p>Limiting access to specific users/IPs.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensuring the SSH daemon is patched to the latest stable
version.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If not essential, disable or remove the service to reduce the
attack surface.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="long-term-strategy">Long-Term Strategy</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Regular Security Awareness Training:</strong> Conduct
mandatory security awareness training for all employees at least
annually, covering evolving threats like phishing, ransomware, and
social engineering.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement a Vulnerability Management Program:</strong>
Regularly scan all internal and external assets for vulnerabilities.
Prioritize and remediate findings based on severity and potential
impact.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop Incident Response Plan:</strong> Create and test
a robust incident response plan to ensure the organization can
effectively detect, contain, eradicate, and recover from cyber
incidents.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Security Policy Framework Development:</strong> Expand
upon the AUP by developing a comprehensive suite of security policies
(e.g., Data Handling Policy, Password Policy, Remote Access
Policy).</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p><strong>Vertex Solutions</strong> currently faces several
high-priority cybersecurity risks stemming from foundational control
gaps and identified technical exposures. Proactive implementation of the
recommended actions, particularly in strengthening MFA, establishing
clear security policies, and enhancing employee awareness, will
significantly improve the organization’s defensive posture. Continuous
monitoring, regular assessments, and ongoing security education are
crucial for maintaining a resilient and secure environment against the
ever-evolving threat landscape.</p>
