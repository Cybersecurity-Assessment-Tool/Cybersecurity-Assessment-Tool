<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of <strong>Skyward
Bound</strong> based on a review of organizational data, a network scan,
and pre-existing risk information. The assessment reveals a mixed
security landscape, with some foundational controls in place, but
significant gaps in multi-factor authentication (MFA) adoption, employee
security awareness, and policy enforcement. A critical internal service
(localhost:22) is noted as an existing high-severity risk. Addressing
these identified vulnerabilities and implementing recommended controls
is crucial to enhancing the overall security posture and reducing
exposure to potential threats.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-questionnaire-gaps">Analysis of
Questionnaire Gaps</h2>
<p>The questionnaire responses indicate several critical gaps in
security controls:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins:</strong> Multi-factor
authentication is not required for logging into computers, significantly
increasing the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised
credentials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> Critical
systems holding sensitive data are not protected by MFA, leaving them
highly vulnerable to credential theft attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of Acceptable Use Policy:</strong> The lack of an
Acceptable Use Policy means employees may not be formally aware of their
responsibilities regarding company IT resources, increasing the risk of
misuse or non-compliance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong> New hires are not receiving initial security
awareness training, making them potentially susceptible to common social
engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) from day one.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed targeting <code>127.0.0.1</code>. This

<p>The network scan was conducted against: <code>127.0.0.1</code></p>

<p>The scan identified the following open port:</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> The provided scan data did not include specific
service, product, or version information for the open port. A more

<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="identified-critical-gaps-from-questionnaire">Identified Critical
Gaps from Questionnaire</h2>
<p>Based on the security control review, the following represent
high-priority risks:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>High Risk: Insufficient MFA Implementation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Overview:</em> Lack of MFA for computer logins and sensitive
data systems exposes critical assets to credential-based
attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Severity:</em> High</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>High Risk: Lack of Employee Acceptable Use
Policy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Overview:</em> Absence of a formal policy increases the
likelihood of unauthorized or inappropriate use of company
resources.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Severity:</em> Medium-High</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>High Risk: Inadequate New Employee Security
Training</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Overview:</em> New employees are untrained in security best
practices, making them an immediate target for social engineering and
phishing attacks. <em>Severity:</em> High</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="technical-vulnerabilities">Technical
Vulnerabilities</h2>
<p>The network scan revealed an open port on the target
<code>127.0.0.1</code>. While port 22 (typically SSH) is a common
service, its presence on localhost needs to be understood in context
with system configuration and purpose. Without service versioning,
specific vulnerabilities cannot be identified, but any open port
represents a potential attack surface.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="pre-existing-risks-from-input-3">Pre-existing
Risks (from Input 3)</h2>

</div>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="correlated-risk-summary">Correlated Risk
Summary</h2>
<p>The assessment reveals a cybersecurity posture with significant
vulnerabilities. The critical pre-existing risk of "Localhost Exposed"
(CVSS 10.0) combined with the technical finding of an open port 22 on
<code>127.0.0.1</code> suggests a potential internal misconfiguration or
unintended exposure of a critical service. This is further exacerbated
by the identified organizational policy gaps: the absence of MFA for
critical systems and computer logins, and the lack of foundational
security awareness for new employees, all contribute to a heightened
overall risk profile. While annual security training is in place, the
initial onboarding gap is significant.</p>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To significantly enhance <strong>Skyward Bound</strong>’s
cybersecurity posture, the following recommendations are provided,
categorized by priority:</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="immediate-actions">Immediate Actions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for All Critical Systems:</strong> Mandate
and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins
and access to sensitive data systems without delay. This is a
foundational control against credential theft.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Address "Localhost Exposed" Risk:</strong> Immediately
investigate the "Localhost Exposed" risk. Understand why a service on
<code>127.0.0.1</code> is considered critical and exposed. If it is SSH
(port 22), ensure it is properly secured, restricted to necessary
users/IPs, and monitored.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="mid-term-actions">Mid-Term Actions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong>
Create a comprehensive AUP outlining employee responsibilities,
acceptable use of company assets, and security expectations. Communicate
this policy to all employees and require acknowledgment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Integrate Security Awareness into New Employee
Onboarding:</strong> Establish mandatory security awareness training as
part of the onboarding process for all new employees, covering phishing,
password hygiene, and data handling best practices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Perform Detailed Vulnerability Scans:</strong> Conduct
regular, comprehensive vulnerability scans with service version
detection to identify outdated software, known vulnerabilities, and
misconfigurations on all internal and external assets.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Review Service on Port 22:</strong> Investigate the
purpose of the service running on port 22 on <code>127.0.0.1</code>. If
not essential or intended to be exposed (even locally), disable it or
restrict access.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="long-term-strategy">Long-Term Strategy</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Continuous Security Training and Awareness:</strong>
Continue annual security awareness training for all employees, updating
content regularly to reflect new threats and best practices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Policy Review:</strong> Periodically review and
update all security policies (including the AUP) to ensure they remain
relevant and effective.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Incident Response Planning:</strong> Develop and test an
incident response plan to ensure the organization can effectively
detect, respond to, and recover from security incidents.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Security Audits:</strong> Engage in periodic
third-party security audits to get an objective assessment of the
security posture and identify emerging risks.</p></li>
