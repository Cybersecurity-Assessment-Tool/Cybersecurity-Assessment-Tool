<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture assessment for
<strong>Iron Oak Furniture</strong>. The analysis synthesizes
information from an organizational security questionnaire. Due to
malformed or incomplete input data, detailed technical scan results
(Input 1) and existing risk register data (Input 3) could not be
processed or correlated.</p>
<p>Key findings highlight several critical gaps in security controls,
particularly concerning Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) implementation
for email and sensitive data systems, and the absence of foundational
security policies and training for new employees. While some controls
are in place, a significant portion of best practices are not met,
increasing the organization’s overall risk exposure. Immediate action on
the recommendations is advised to strengthen the security posture.</p>

(Target: <code>[Target IP]</code>)</h2>
<p>The provided network scan data (Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON) was
malformed and could not be processed. As such, no technical
vulnerabilities, open ports, or service details could be identified from
the scan input. It is strongly recommended that a valid, comprehensive
network scan be performed to accurately assess the external attack
surface.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the available data, the primary identified risks stem from
critical gaps in security controls as revealed by the organizational
questionnaire. Due to issues with the provided data, an analysis of
existing vulnerabilities (Input 3) and detailed technical scan findings
(Input 1) could not be performed.</p>

<td style="text-align: left;">Without Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

access to an employee’s inbox, potentially leading to phishing, business
email compromise (BEC), and further internal network access. This is a

<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy

<td style="text-align: left;">Inadequate Security Awareness Training for
New Employees</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">New employees without immediate security
awareness training are more susceptible to common social engineering

<h2 id="existing-vulnerabilities">Existing Vulnerabilities</h2>
<p>The provided existing vulnerabilities data
(Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON) was malformed and could not be processed.
Therefore, no pre-existing vulnerabilities could be assessed or
correlated with current findings. It is essential for any organization
to maintain an accurate and up-to-date vulnerability register as part of
a robust vulnerability management program.</p>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and strengthen the cybersecurity
posture of <strong>Iron Oak Furniture</strong>, the following actionable
recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email
Accounts:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Enable and rigorously enforce MFA for all organizational email
accounts. This is a primary defense against phishing and credential
stuffing attacks, significantly reducing the risk of email
compromise.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive
Data Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mandate MFA for all access to systems storing or processing
sensitive organizational or customer data. This critical step protects
against unauthorized access to high-value information.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement a Comprehensive Acceptable Use
Policy (AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Draft a detailed AUP outlining the proper use of company IT
resources, internet, email, and data.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all employees, new and existing, review and formally
acknowledge the AUP, ideally during onboarding and annually thereafter,
with consequences for non-compliance.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Enhance New Employee Security Awareness
Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Integrate mandatory, comprehensive security awareness training
into the onboarding process for all new hires. This training should be
completed before they gain access to company systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Training should cover essential topics such as phishing
identification, strong password hygiene, secure data handling, incident
reporting procedures, and the organization’s AUP.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct a Valid External Network Scan:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Perform a comprehensive external network vulnerability scan to
identify open ports, outdated services, misconfigurations, and potential
vulnerabilities on all internet-facing assets.</p></li>
<li><p>Regularly review and remediate findings from these scans to
reduce the external attack surface.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish a Robust Vulnerability Management
Program:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement a systematic process for identifying, assessing,
prioritizing, tracking, and remediating vulnerabilities across all IT
systems and applications.</p></li>
<li><p>Maintain an accurate and up-to-date register of known
vulnerabilities and their remediation status to facilitate continuous
improvement.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>While <strong>Iron Oak Furniture</strong> currently employs some
foundational security practices (e.g., MFA for computer login, annual
security training), significant vulnerabilities exist due to the lack of
MFA in critical areas (email, sensitive data systems) and the absence of
fundamental security policies (AUP) and initial employee training.
Addressing these identified gaps immediately and implementing the
provided recommendations will substantially reduce the organization’s
risk profile, enhance its resilience against sophisticated cyber
threats, and improve overall compliance. Continuous monitoring, regular
assessments, and ongoing improvement of security controls are essential
for maintaining a strong and adaptive cybersecurity posture.</p>
