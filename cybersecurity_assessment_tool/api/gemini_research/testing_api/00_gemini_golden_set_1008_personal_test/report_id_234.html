<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of Modern Myth, derived
from an analysis of self-reported organizational data, a targeted
internal network scan, and a review of pre-existing vulnerabilities. The
assessment highlights critical areas requiring immediate attention,
specifically regarding the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
for sensitive data systems, the lack of an Acceptable Use Policy, and
insufficient annual security awareness training for all employees. While
a scan of the internal host <code>192.168.0.5</code> indicated no
exposed services on commonly scanned ports like 80 (it was closed), an
existing organizational risk points to unencrypted web servers that
warrant further investigation across the broader infrastructure.
Addressing the identified gaps and risks is crucial for enhancing Modern
Myth’s resilience against evolving cyber threats and ensuring a robust
security framework.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="findings">Findings</h2>
<p>The scan determined that the target host <code>192.168.0.5</code> was
online. Critically, based on the provided scan data, <strong>no open
ports were identified</strong> on this specific system. Port 80, often
associated with unencrypted web services, was explicitly found to be
<code>closed</code>. This is a positive finding for the scanned host,
indicating a limited attack surface from services on this specific
IP.</p>

<td style="text-align: left;">Medium</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">While new employees receive initial

the presence of an unencrypted web server operating on Port 80.
<em>Note: The recent network scan of <code>192.168.0.5</code> found Port
80 to be closed on that specific host, suggesting this particular risk
might be mitigated for this system or pertains to other components of

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and strengthen Modern Myth’s
cybersecurity posture, the following actionable recommendations are
provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Prioritize the deployment and mandatory
enforcement of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all systems,
applications, and databases that store or process sensitive
organizational data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> This critical measure significantly
reduces the likelihood of successful unauthorized access, even in
scenarios where primary credentials (usernames and passwords) have been
compromised.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Draft, finalize, and formally implement
a comprehensive Acceptable Use Policy. This policy should clearly define
acceptable and unacceptable use of company IT resources (e.g., networks,
hardware, software, internet access) and secure signed acknowledgments
from all employees.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> An AUP establishes clear boundaries for
employee conduct, helps reduce insider threats, and forms a foundational
element for legal and compliance frameworks.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish a Robust Annual Security Awareness Training
Program:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Beyond initial onboarding training,
design and implement a mandatory annual security awareness training
program for all employees. This program should cover current threat
landscapes, social engineering techniques, data handling best practices,
and incident reporting procedures.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Regular training keeps employees
informed about the latest cyber threats, enhances their ability to
recognize and report suspicious activities, and cultivates a stronger,
security-conscious culture across the organization.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Review and Remediate Existing Unencrypted Web Server
Risks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Conduct a thorough audit of all internal
and external web servers within the organization to identify any
instances serving content over unencrypted HTTP (Port 80). For any
identified, prioritize migration to HTTPS (Port 443) using valid,
trusted SSL/TLS certificates. If Port 80 must remain open, ensure it
only provides a secure redirect to HTTPS.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Encrypting web traffic protects
sensitive data from eavesdropping and tampering during transit, enhances
user trust, and is essential for compliance with many data protection
regulations. While the scan of <code>192.168.0.5</code> was positive,
the existing risk indicates a broader organizational vulnerability that
must be addressed.</p></li>
</ul></li>
