<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive assessment of Firebrand Media’s
cybersecurity posture, synthesized from an internal network scan, a
review of organizational security controls, and analysis of existing
risk data. Key findings reveal critical vulnerabilities, particularly
the direct exposure of Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) services on
internal network assets and significant gaps in fundamental security
practices. These gaps include the absence of multi-factor authentication
(MFA) for email and sensitive data systems, and a complete lack of
consistent security awareness training for employees. The current
security landscape indicates a high overall risk profile, necessitating
immediate and focused remediation efforts to fortify the organization’s
defenses against prevalent cyber threats.</p>

Review</h1>
<p>A review of Firebrand Media’s self-reported security controls
highlights several critical areas that require immediate strategic
attention. Notably, the implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) is inconsistent across vital systems, and foundational security
awareness training for employees is largely absent.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>An internal network scan was performed to identify active services
and open ports. The scan specifically targeted the internal host
<code>10.10.10.51</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target Host:</strong> <code>10.10.10.51</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> 2026-01-27</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Tool:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Identified Open Ports and Services:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port:</strong> 3389/TCP</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Service:</strong> ms-wbt-server (Microsoft Windows-based
Terminal Server / Remote Desktop Protocol)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>State:</strong> Open</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Product/Version Information:</strong> Not identified by
the provided scan data.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The discovery of an open Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) port on an
internal host, even within a local network segment, represents a
significant finding. While not directly exposed to the internet in this
specific scan context, RDP is a frequently targeted service and can
serve as a critical vector for lateral movement and privilege escalation
once an attacker has gained initial access to the internal network.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section correlates and synthesizes identified risks from
pre-existing vulnerability data, identified security control gaps, and
the recent technical scan findings. Risks are categorized by their
severity and potential impact.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="security-control-gaps-high-severity">Security
Control Gaps (High Severity)</h2>
<p>The following deficiencies identified during the security control
review are categorized as high severity due to their significant
potential impact on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
Firebrand Media’s assets and data:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Email Access (SC-01):</strong> Without
Multi-Factor Authentication, employee email accounts are highly
vulnerable to various attacks, including credential stuffing, phishing,
and brute-force attempts. A compromised email account can serve as a
gateway for Business Email Compromise (BEC) fraud, data exfiltration,
and further sophisticated network infiltration.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems (SC-03):</strong>
The absence of MFA for systems containing sensitive data drastically
increases the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. If user
credentials are stolen or successfully guessed, attackers can gain
direct access to critical organizational data without an additional
layer of verification.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of Comprehensive Security Awareness Training
(SC-05, SC-06):</strong> Employees frequently represent the human
element in cybersecurity defenses. Without regular and mandatory
security awareness training for both new and existing personnel,
employees are more susceptible to falling victim to phishing, social
engineering attacks, and failing to adhere to essential security best
practices. This significantly increases the likelihood of an initial
compromise and subsequent security incidents.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To proactively enhance Firebrand Media’s cybersecurity posture and
mitigate the identified risks, the following actionable recommendations
are provided, with a strong emphasis on addressing critical and
high-severity findings:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement and Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Across Critical Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Email Systems:</strong> Immediately enable and mandate
MFA for all employee email accounts to significantly reduce the risk of
credential compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> Implement robust MFA
requirements for all access points to systems and applications that
store or process sensitive organizational data.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Secure Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) Access on Internal
Assets:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>For and (and similar hosts):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Restrict Access:</strong> Implement stringent firewall
rules to limit RDP access to only specific, authorized internal IP
addresses and users.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>VPN Requirement:</strong> For any external or remote RDP
access, mandate the use of a Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection.
Ensure direct internet exposure of RDP is disabled.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Strong Authentication:</strong> Enforce strong, complex,
and unique passwords for all accounts with RDP access. Consider RDP
Gateway or similar solutions for centralized management and MFA
enforcement.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Patch Management:</strong> Ensure all systems running RDP
services are regularly updated with the latest security patches to
protect against known vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Disable or Replace:</strong> If RDP is not strictly
necessary, disable the service. Alternatively, explore more secure
remote administration alternatives.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish a Comprehensive Security Awareness Training
Program:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Onboarding Training:</strong> Develop and implement
mandatory security awareness training for all new employees as a
critical component of their onboarding process.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Annual Training:</strong> Conduct mandatory,
organization-wide security awareness training for all employees at least
once per year, covering contemporary threats such as phishing, social
engineering tactics, password hygiene, and proper data handling
procedures.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Continuous Reinforcement:</strong> Implement regular
simulated phishing campaigns and security bulletins to continuously test
employee vigilance and reinforce training concepts.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Review and Update Security Policies and
Procedures:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ensure the existing employee acceptable use policy (AUP) is
up-to-date, clearly communicated, and actively enforced across the
organization.</p></li>
<li><p>Develop and disseminate clear, comprehensive policies regarding
remote access, data classification, password management, and incident
response procedures.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Firebrand Media currently operates within a significant cybersecurity
risk landscape, primarily characterized by exposed RDP services on
internal hosts and critical deficiencies in fundamental security
controls such as Multi-Factor Authentication and regular security
awareness training. Addressing these identified risks and diligently
implementing the provided remediation steps is paramount for
substantially bolstering the organization’s defensive capabilities
against prevalent cyber threats and safeguarding its valuable assets and
data. A proactive, layered security approach, commencing with the
immediate implementation of these foundational controls, will be
indispensable for achieving a more resilient and secure operational
environment.</p>
