<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides an assessment of Quantum Reach’s cybersecurity
posture based on a network scan, organizational security questionnaire
responses, and a review of existing risks. Key findings indicate
critical gaps in foundational security controls, including a lack of
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access, the absence of an
Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), and insufficient annual security
awareness training. Furthermore, an End-of-Life (EOL) MySQL database
(version 5.7.33) was identified with an open port, posing a significant
vulnerability due to unpatched security flaws and potential exposure.
These issues collectively elevate the organization’s risk profile and
require immediate attention to mitigate potential cyber threats.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed against the target IP address . The scan
identified the following open port and associated service:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not provided in input data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Port(s) Found:</strong></p>

<li><p><strong>Service:</strong> MySQL</p></li>

</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of
Technical Findings</h2>
<p>The presence of MySQL version 5.7.33 on port 3306 is a critical
finding. MySQL 5.7 reached its End-of-Life (EOL) in October 2023. This
means it no longer receives security updates or bug fixes, making it
highly vulnerable to newly discovered exploits. The fact that port 3306
is open, particularly with EOL software, poses a significant risk of
data breaches, unauthorized access, and system compromise if not
properly secured and isolated. This finding correlates with the
pre-existing "Database Exposure" risk, which is now exacerbated by the
EOL status of the software.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes findings from the questionnaire, technical
scan, and pre-existing risk data to provide a comprehensive view of the
organization’s risk posture. Risks are categorized by severity.</p>

<td style="text-align: left;">MySQL version 5.7.33, which reached
End-of-Life (EOL) in October 2023, is running on port 3306. This
service, already noted as exposed, is now critically vulnerable due to

<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>3. Absence of Employee Acceptable
Use Policy (AUP)</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Without a formal AUP, employees may be
unaware of expected conduct regarding technology usage, data handling,
and security best practices. This increases the risk of accidental data
breaches, malware infections, and non-compliance with regulations.</td>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and enhance Quantum Reach’s
cybersecurity posture, the following actionable recommendations are
provided:</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="immediate-actions-high-priority">Immediate
Actions (High Priority)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade/Patch End-of-Life MySQL and Secure Port
3306:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Short-Term:</strong> Implement strict firewall rules to
restrict access to port 3306 (MySQL) to only trusted internal IP
addresses and necessary hosts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Long-Term:</strong> Plan and execute an upgrade of the
MySQL database to a currently supported version (e.g., MySQL 8.0) as
soon as possible. Alternatively, consider migrating to a modern, managed
database service. Ensure regular patching and configuration hardening
for the chosen solution.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Additionally:</strong> If the database does not require
network access from other hosts, consider binding it only to the
localhost interface or using a secure VPN for remote administrative
access.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Access:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Mandate and configure Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for all employee email accounts without delay. This
is a critical control against credential theft and vastly improves
account security.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Draft and officially adopt a
comprehensive AUP that clearly outlines employee responsibilities
regarding the use of company IT resources, internet access, data
handling, and security. Ensure all employees read, understand, and
formally acknowledge the policy annually.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Annual Security Awareness Training for All
Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop and implement a program for
mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees, not just
new hires. Training should be engaging and cover contemporary threats
such as phishing, social engineering, ransomware, data protection best
practices, and strong password hygiene.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="general-best-practices">General Best
Practices</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Conduct regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing
to identify and address security weaknesses proactively.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement a robust patch management program for all operating
systems, applications, and network devices.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure proper network segmentation to isolate critical systems
and limit the blast radius of potential breaches.</p></li>
<li><p>Develop, document, and regularly test an incident response plan
to ensure the organization can effectively detect, respond to, and
recover from security incidents.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Quantum Reach faces several significant cybersecurity challenges,
particularly concerning its use of End-of-Life software and critical
gaps in fundamental security policies and user training. Addressing
these issues proactively is crucial to safeguarding organizational data,
maintaining operational continuity, and protecting against evolving
cyber threats. Prioritizing the implementation of MFA for email,
upgrading critical infrastructure, and bolstering human-centric controls
through comprehensive policies and recurrent training will substantially
improve the overall security posture and resilience against
cyberattacks.</p>
