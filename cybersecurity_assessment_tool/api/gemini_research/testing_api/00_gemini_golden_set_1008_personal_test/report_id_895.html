<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">1. Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for <strong>Clear Path</strong>. The analysis integrates an
organizational security control review, technical network scan results,
and an evaluation of existing risks.</p>
<p>Key findings indicate a mixed security posture. While foundational
controls like Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and user
logins, and an acceptable use policy, are in place, critical gaps were
identified. Specifically, MFA is not uniformly applied to sensitive data
systems, and organization-wide security awareness training is not
conducted annually.</p>
<p>The technical scan revealed an open SSH port (22/tcp) on the internal
target . While SSH is a secure protocol when configured correctly, its
presence without detailed service information warrants attention and
hardening.</p>
<p>Recommendations are provided to address these identified
vulnerabilities and strengthen <strong>Clear Path</strong>’s overall
security posture.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="organizational-information">2. Organizational
Information</h1>
<p>The following organizational details were gathered for this
assessment:</p>

<li><p><strong>Email Domain:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Website Domain:</strong></p></li>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="identified-control-gaps">3.1. Identified
Control Gaps</h2>
<p>Based on the security control review, the following critical gaps
were identified:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong>
Multi-Factor Authentication is not a mandatory requirement for accessing
systems that handle sensitive organizational data. This significantly
elevates the risk of unauthorized access in the event of credential
compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Infrequent Security Awareness Training:</strong> Security
awareness training is not conducted for all employees on an annual
basis. Regular, up-to-date training is essential to educate staff about
current cyber threats, best practices, and the importance of a strong
security culture.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">4. Technical Scan
Results</h1>

Observations</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Open Port 22 (SSH):</strong> The presence of an open
Secure Shell (SSH) port indicates a remote access capability on the
target system. While SSH is a secure protocol when properly configured,
it represents a potential attack surface. Without specific service or
version details, it is not possible to assess for known vulnerabilities,
but general hardening practices are strongly recommended to mitigate
risks associated with remote access.</p></li>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">6. Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actionable recommendations are provided to address the
identified risks and enhance <strong>Clear Path</strong>’s overall
cybersecurity posture.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="address-critical-control-gaps">6.1. Address
Critical Control Gaps</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for All Sensitive Data
Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Prioritize the mandatory implementation of Multi-Factor
Authentication for all systems that store, process, or transmit
sensitive organizational or client data.</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluate and deploy appropriate MFA solutions (e.g.,
authenticator apps, hardware tokens, biometrics) suitable for the
organization’s infrastructure.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct thorough testing to ensure MFA implementation does not
hinder legitimate business operations while providing robust
security.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Annual Security Awareness Training
Program:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and implement a mandatory, comprehensive annual security
awareness training program for all employees, including contractors and
temporary staff.</p></li>
<li><p>Training content should be regularly updated to reflect current
threat landscapes, covering topics such as phishing, ransomware, secure
password practices, data handling, and incident reporting.</p></li>
<li><p>Utilize engaging and interactive training methods to maximize
employee retention and understanding.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="enhance-technical-security">6.2. Enhance
Technical Security</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Harden SSH Service on :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Review and Restrict Access:</strong> Configure the SSH
daemon to restrict access to only necessary administrative IP addresses
or subnets.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Disable Password Authentication:</strong> Enforce strong
authentication methods, preferably key-based authentication, and disable
password-based login for SSH where feasible.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Change Default Port:</strong> Consider changing the
default SSH port (22) to a non-standard high port to deter automated
scanning and basic brute-force attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Keep Software Updated:</strong> Ensure the SSH daemon and
the underlying operating system are kept fully patched and up-to-date to
protect against known vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Logging and Monitoring:</strong> Configure
robust logging for SSH access attempts (both successful and failed) and
integrate these logs into a security information and event management
(SIEM) system for continuous monitoring and alerting.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">7. Conclusion</h1>
<p><strong>Clear Path</strong> has a foundation for cybersecurity,
particularly with MFA for email and logins, and an acceptable use
policy. However, the identified critical gaps concerning MFA for
sensitive data systems and the frequency of security awareness training
present significant risks that require immediate attention. The open SSH
port, while not immediately indicative of a vulnerability without
further information, necessitates proactive hardening.</p>
<p>By diligently implementing the recommendations outlined in this
report, <strong>Clear Path</strong> can substantially enhance its
defensive capabilities, reduce its attack surface, and foster a more
robust cybersecurity posture against evolving threats.</p>
