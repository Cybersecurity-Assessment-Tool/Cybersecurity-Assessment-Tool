<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for <strong>True North Travel</strong>. The analysis is based on
organizational data, security control questionnaires, and technical
network scan results, augmented by a review of pre-existing identified
risks. While the organization demonstrates strengths in some areas,
particularly with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and
computer login, critical vulnerabilities and control gaps were
identified. Key areas for immediate attention include the absence of MFA
for sensitive data systems, a complete lack of security awareness
training for employees, and the presence of exposed local services.
Addressing these findings is crucial for enhancing the overall security
posture and reducing the attack surface.</p>

Gaps Identified from Questionnaire:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> Multi-factor
authentication is not required for accessing systems containing
sensitive data. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized
access should credentials be compromised.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Security Awareness Training (New Employees):</strong> New
employees do not receive mandatory security awareness training. This
leaves them vulnerable to social engineering attacks and potentially
unaware of critical organizational security policies and best
practices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Annual Security Awareness Training:</strong> There is no
annual security awareness training for all employees. This oversight can
lead to a decay in security knowledge and a lack of awareness regarding
evolving cyber threats, making the organization more susceptible to
human-factor incidents.</p></li>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the assessment, the following actionable recommendations are
provided to enhance <strong>True North Travel</strong>’s cybersecurity
posture and mitigate identified risks:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong>
Mandate multi-factor authentication for all systems that store, process,
or transmit sensitive organizational or customer data. This is a
fundamental control to significantly reduce the impact of credential
theft and unauthorized access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Comprehensive Security Awareness Training
Programs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement mandatory security awareness training for all new
employees as part of their onboarding process. This training should
cover essential security policies, threat identification (e.g.,
phishing), and safe computing practices.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct annual, mandatory security awareness training for all
employees. This recurring training should refresh knowledge, update
employees on new and evolving threats, and reinforce organizational
security best practices.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Review and Secure Localhost Services:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Promptly investigate the service running on Port 22 of .
Determine its purpose and whether it requires network
accessibility.</p></li>
<li><p>If access is required, ensure it is properly secured using strong
authentication mechanisms, least privilege principles, network access
controls (e.g., firewall rules), and up-to-date patching of the
underlying service and operating system.</p></li>
<li><p>If the service is not intended for network access, ensure it is
configured to bind only to the necessary local interfaces or is
explicitly firewalled off from any external or internal network
access.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Regular Vulnerability Scanning and Patch
Management:</strong> Establish a routine schedule for vulnerability
scanning across all systems, applications, and network devices.
Complement this with a robust patch management program to promptly
address identified vulnerabilities and apply security updates.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Test an Incident Response Plan:</strong>
Create and regularly test a comprehensive incident response plan. This
plan should outline procedures for detecting, analyzing, containing,
eradicating, recovering from, and post-incident reviewing of
cybersecurity incidents to minimize their impact.</p></li>
