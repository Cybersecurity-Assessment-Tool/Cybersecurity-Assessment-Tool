<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">1. Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report presents a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for Atlas Mapping, derived from the analysis of network scan data,
organizational security questionnaire responses, and a review of
existing risk information. The assessment highlights critical security
gaps, predominantly in the areas of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
for email access and the implementation of robust security awareness
training programs. While the network scan on the internal target
indicated no immediately exploitable open ports, the identified
procedural and policy weaknesses represent significant risks to the
organization’s overall security. Addressing the recommendations outlined
in this report is paramount for strengthening Atlas Mapping’s defensive
capabilities against current cyber threats.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">4. Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>An Nmap scan was conducted on the internal target
<code>192.168.1.100</code> to identify open ports and services that
could present vulnerabilities.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>192.168.1.100</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Data not available in input.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Findings:</strong> The scan indicated that the host is
up, but no open ports were detected. This is generally a positive
finding, suggesting that the host is either well-firewalled, has all
network services intentionally closed or filtered, or is not running any
services on standard ports accessible to the scanner. This reduces the
immediate external attack surface. However, a comprehensive security
posture assessment would necessitate further investigation, such as
authenticated vulnerability scans or host-based analysis, to confirm the
device’s full security status.</p></li>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment">5. Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of security controls, technical scan results,

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">6. Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and enhance Atlas Mapping’s overall
cybersecurity posture, the following actionable recommendations are
provided:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email
Access:</strong> Immediately deploy and enforce MFA for all email
accounts across the organization. This is a fundamental control against
credential theft, phishing, and account takeover.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Mandatory New Employee Security Awareness
Training:</strong> Develop and implement a comprehensive security
awareness training program that is mandatory for all new hires. This
training should be completed before new employees gain access to
organizational systems and sensitive data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Annual Security Awareness Training for All
Employees:</strong> Implement a recurring (at least annual) security
awareness training program for all existing employees. This training
should be updated regularly to cover current threat landscapes,
organizational policies, and best practices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Vulnerability Management Program:</strong> While
the initial scan found no open ports, consider implementing a continuous
vulnerability scanning program for all internal and external assets.
This should include authenticated vulnerability scans for internal hosts
to identify software misconfigurations and patch deficiencies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Review and Test Incident Response Plan:</strong> Ensure
an up-to-date and regularly tested incident response plan is in place to
effectively manage and mitigate potential security incidents stemming
from identified risks, especially those related to credential compromise
or social engineering.</p></li>
