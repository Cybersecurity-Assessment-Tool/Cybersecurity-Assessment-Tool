<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report presents a cybersecurity posture assessment for
<strong>Brimstone Manufacturing</strong>, based on a review of
organizational data, a targeted network scan, and existing risk
documentation. The assessment highlights key strengths, identified
vulnerabilities, and actionable recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>Brimstone Manufacturing</strong> demonstrates good practices
in some areas, such as requiring Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
email and computer logins, maintaining an acceptable use policy, and
conducting annual security awareness training. However, critical gaps
were identified: the lack of MFA for sensitive data systems and the
absence of mandatory security awareness training for new employees.
Furthermore, a network scan revealed an exposed MySQL database service
running an outdated, End-of-Life (EOL) version (<code>5.7.33</code>),
which is also noted in the organization’s existing risk documentation as
’Database Exposure’.</p>
<p>This combination of control gaps and technical vulnerabilities
significantly elevates the overall risk profile. Urgent recommendations
include immediately implementing MFA for all sensitive data systems,
establishing mandatory security awareness training for new hires, and
securing/patching the exposed MySQL database. Adhering to these
recommendations will substantially improve <strong>Brimstone
Manufacturing</strong>’s security posture and reduce its susceptibility
to common attack vectors.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-security-control-gaps">Analysis
of Security Control Gaps</h2>
<p>The review highlights critical areas for improvement:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> The absence of
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for sensitive data systems is a
significant vulnerability. This control is crucial in preventing
unauthorized access, even if credentials are compromised, by adding an
extra layer of verification.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>New Employee Security Awareness Training:</strong> Not
conducting security awareness training for new employees leaves them
vulnerable to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, malware) from
day one. This poses an immediate and preventable risk to the
organization’s security posture.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A targeted network scan was performed on the internal host . The scan
results are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Status:</strong> Host is up.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports and Services:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port:</strong> 3306/tcp</p></li>
<li><p><strong>State:</strong> Open</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Service:</strong> MySQL</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Product:</strong> MySQL</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Version:</strong> 5.7.33</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of
Technical Findings</h2>
<p>The scan identified an open MySQL database service on port 3306,
running version <code>5.7.33</code>. MySQL 5.7 reached its End-of-Life
(EOL) in October 2023, meaning it no longer receives official security
updates, bug fixes, or technical support. Exposing an EOL database
service to the network, especially one potentially containing sensitive
data, presents a severe security risk. This configuration is highly
susceptible to known vulnerabilities and exploits for which no patches
will be released, significantly increasing the likelihood of a
successful breach.</p>

questionnaire, technical scan, and pre-existing risk documentation to

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the assessment, the following recommendations are provided
to enhance <strong>Brimstone Manufacturing</strong>’s cybersecurity
posture:</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="immediate-actions">Immediate Actions</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong>
Mandate Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all access to systems
containing sensitive data. Prioritize implementation based on data
classification, system criticality, and potential impact of a
breach.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Secure MySQL Port 3306:</strong> Immediately restrict
network access to MySQL port 3306 on . Implement strict firewall rules
to allow access only from authorized hosts or segments (e.g.,
application servers). Consider binding MySQL to localhost if direct
external access is not required.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Initiate New Employee Security Awareness
Training:</strong> Develop and implement a mandatory security awareness
training program for all new employees, to be completed as part of their
onboarding process. This training should cover phishing, malware, strong
password practices, and reporting suspicious activities.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="mid-term-actions">Mid-Term Actions</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade/Patch MySQL Database:</strong> Plan and execute
an upgrade of the MySQL database to a currently supported and patched
version (e.g., MySQL 8.0 or newer). This will ensure the database
receives ongoing security updates and support. Alternatively, explore
migrating data to a more secure and actively maintained database
solution.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Vulnerability Scanning:</strong> Implement a
schedule for regular internal and external vulnerability scans to
proactively identify and address misconfigurations, outdated software,
and new vulnerabilities across the IT environment.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="long-term-strategy">Long-Term Strategy</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Review and Update Security Policies:</strong>
Periodically review and update all security policies, including the
acceptable use policy, data handling policies, and incident response
plans, to ensure they remain relevant and address evolving threats and
technological changes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Security Architecture Review:</strong> Conduct a
comprehensive review of the overall network and system architecture to
ensure defense-in-depth principles are applied and critical assets are
adequately protected through segmentation, least privilege, and robust
controls.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Zero Trust Implementation (Phased Approach):</strong>
Explore and plan for a phased implementation of a Zero Trust
architecture, focusing on micro-segmentation, continuous verification of
identity and device posture, and granular least privilege access across
the environment.</p></li>
