<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity assessment
conducted for <strong>Nomad Gear Co.</strong>. The assessment
incorporated organizational security posture data via a questionnaire,
and attempted to incorporate network scan results and pre-existing
vulnerability data. Due to significant data unavailability for the
network scan and pre-existing vulnerabilities, this report’s findings
are primarily based on the organizational security questionnaire.</p>
<p>Key findings indicate critical gaps in multi-factor authentication
(MFA) implementation and foundational security awareness and policy
enforcement. Specifically, MFA is not universally required for email or
computer logins, and the organization lacks an acceptable use policy and
consistent security awareness training programs. These areas represent
significant vulnerabilities that require immediate attention to enhance
the overall security posture of <strong>Nomad Gear Co.</strong>.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-questionnaire-findings">Analysis
of Questionnaire Findings</h2>
<p>The questionnaire highlights significant weaknesses in several
fundamental security controls, which are crucial for a robust security
posture:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Gaps:</strong> The lack
of MFA enforcement for email access and computer logins is a critical
vulnerability. MFA is a fundamental security layer that drastically
reduces the risk of account compromise due to stolen or weak
credentials. While MFA is used for sensitive data systems, its absence
in more common access points (email, general computer login) leaves
significant attack vectors open.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> Without
a formal AUP, employees may not fully understand their responsibilities
regarding the proper use of company IT resources, internet, and data.
This can lead to inadvertent or intentional misuse, increasing the risk
of data breaches, malware infections, and compliance issues.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Security Awareness Training:</strong> The
complete absence of security awareness training for both new and
existing employees is a severe gap. Employees are often the first line
of defense against cyberattacks. Untrained staff are highly susceptible
to social engineering, phishing, and other human-centric attacks, making
them the weakest link in the organization’s security chain.</p></li>

<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="open-ports-and-services">Open Ports and
Services</h2>
<p>No network scan data was provided for analysis; therefore, a
technical assessment of open ports, running services, software versions,
and potential network-based vulnerabilities cannot be performed at this
time. This is a critical limitation of the current assessment. It is
strongly recommended that <strong>Nomad Gear Co.</strong> conduct a
comprehensive network vulnerability scan (external and internal) to
identify potential attack vectors, misconfigurations, and outdated
software that could be exploited by malicious actors.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the available information, the primary risks identified are
directly linked to the critical gaps in security controls highlighted by
the questionnaire. As previously noted, no technical vulnerabilities
from network scans or pre-existing risks from external data sources
could be assessed due to data unavailability.</p>
