<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report presents a comprehensive assessment of the cybersecurity
posture for North Star Education, derived from an analysis of
organizational data, an internal network scan, and an evaluation of
existing risks. While the technical scan of an internal host revealed a
minimal network attack surface with no open ports detected, significant
vulnerabilities were identified in critical security controls. Key
findings highlight the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
email and computer logins, alongside a lack of essential security
policies and employee training. These deficiencies represent high-risk
areas that expose the organization to prevalent cyber threats such as
phishing, credential theft, and insider threats. Immediate
recommendations are provided to implement MFA, establish foundational
security policies, and initiate robust security awareness training
programs to bolster the organization’s resilience.</p>

</div>
<h2 id="analysis-of-control-gaps">Analysis of Control Gaps</h2>
<p>The questionnaire results expose significant gaps in critical
security controls. Notably, the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) for both email access and computer logins introduces a high risk
of account compromise. While MFA is correctly implemented for sensitive
data systems, its lack in these other fundamental areas makes the
organization highly susceptible to attacks like phishing, credential
stuffing, and password reuse. Furthermore, the non-existence of an
Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and the complete absence of
security awareness training (both for new hires and annually for all
staff) highlight a critical unaddressed human risk factor. These policy
and training voids can lead to employee error, policy violations, and
increased susceptibility to social engineering attacks, profoundly
impacting the overall security posture.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An Nmap network scan was conducted on a specific internal target
host.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Target:</strong> (Note: This is an internal private
IP address.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Status:</strong> The host was reported as
<code>up</code> (reachable).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports Found:</strong> None. The scan indicated that
all extraports were <code>closed</code> and no specific open ports were
identified.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not provided in the input
metadata.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of Technical
Findings</h2>
<p>The Nmap scan results for the internal host demonstrate a minimal
network attack surface, as no open ports were detected. This is a
positive indicator for the security configuration of this particular
system, suggesting it may be well-hardened against network-based
enumeration and direct service exploitation. However, it is crucial to
understand that this scan targeted an internal IP address and provides
no insight into the security posture of the organization’s
external-facing assets (e.g., ) or other internal systems. The absence
of detected open ports could mean the host is not running network
services, services are running on non-standard ports not covered by the
scan, or network-level filtering is effectively in place. No software
versions or products were identified due to the lack of open ports.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the comprehensive analysis of security controls, technical
scan results, and the absence of pre-existing reported vulnerabilities
(Input 3 was empty), the primary risks identified are predominantly
related to gaps in policy enforcement and human factors.</p>
