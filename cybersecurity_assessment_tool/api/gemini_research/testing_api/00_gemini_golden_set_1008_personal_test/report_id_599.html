<h1 id="executive-overview">Executive Overview</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of <strong>Nexus
Dynamics</strong>, based on a review of organizational data, existing
risk assessments, and a technical network scan. The assessment reveals
several critical areas requiring immediate attention, primarily
concerning multi-factor authentication (MFA) adoption, employee security
awareness training, and a critical internal exposure.</p>
<p>The technical scan identified an open SSH port on the localhost,
which, when correlated with existing risk data, is classified as a
critical exposure (CVSS 10.0). Furthermore, significant gaps in MFA
implementation across email and computer logins, alongside a complete
absence of regular security awareness training, present high-priority
risks that could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and
compromise of organizational systems. Addressing these foundational
security controls is paramount to improving the overall security
posture.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-security-control-gaps">Analysis of Security Control
Gaps</h2>
<p>The review of security control questions highlights several
significant weaknesses:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Email and Computer Logins:</strong>
Critical services like email and general computer access are not
protected by MFA. This significantly increases the risk of account
compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or stolen credentials.
While MFA is used for sensitive data systems, its absence in more common
access points creates a substantial attack surface.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Insufficient Security Awareness Training:</strong> The
organization does not conduct security awareness training for new
employees or annually for all employees. This lack of continuous
education leaves employees vulnerable to social engineering attacks,
phishing, and other human-centric threats, making them potential weak
links in the security chain.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed to identify open ports and services on a
specified target.</p>
<h2 id="scan-details">Scan Details</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Used:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> 2026-01-27</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Target Host:</strong> (localhost)</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="host-findings">Host Findings</h2>
<p>The scan identified one active host:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>IP Address:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Status:</strong> Up</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port:</strong> 22/tcp</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Service:</strong> ssh</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Product/Version:</strong> Unknown (not identified by
scan)</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="technical-analysis">Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>The scan revealed an open SSH (Port 22) service on the localhost IP
address (). While an open SSH port on localhost is not inherently
malicious, its presence, especially without detailed version
information, requires scrutiny. Given the existing risk assessment (see
Section <a href="#sec:risk_assessment" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:risk_assessment">5</a>), this finding correlates
with a critically severe exposure. Without information on the product or
version, it is difficult to identify specific software vulnerabilities,
but the service itself being exposed on localhost is flagged as a
critical issue by the organization’s current risk register.</p>
<h1 id="sec:risk_assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes findings from the security control review,
technical scan, and pre-existing risk data to provide a comprehensive

</div>
<h2 id="correlation-and-impact">Correlation and Impact</h2>
<p>The critical risks identified from the questionnaire (lack of MFA and
security awareness training) create significant attack vectors for
external adversaries. Compromised credentials due to these gaps could
lead to unauthorized access to internal systems and sensitive data.</p>
<p>The technical finding of an open SSH port on directly correlates with
the pre-existing risk "Localhost Exposed" with a CVSS score of 10.0.
This indicates a severe internal exposure that could be exploited if an
attacker gains initial access (potentially through one of the
aforementioned MFA/training gaps) or if the localhost is unexpectedly
accessible from other network segments or even externally. The critical
severity underscores the potential for system-level compromise or
privilege escalation.</p>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are provided to
enhance the cybersecurity posture of <strong>Nexus
Dynamics</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Across All
Critical Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Email Access:</strong> Immediately implement mandatory
MFA for all employee email accounts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Computer Logins:</strong> Roll out MFA for all corporate
computer logins to protect against stolen credentials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scope Expansion:</strong> Review all other critical
internal and external systems to ensure MFA is enabled wherever
possible.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Comprehensive Security Awareness Training
Programs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>New Hires:</strong> Implement mandatory security
awareness training as part of the onboarding process for all new
employees.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Annual Training:</strong> Conduct mandatory annual
security awareness training for all employees, covering topics such as
phishing, social engineering, password hygiene, and data handling best
practices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Phishing Simulations:</strong> Consider regular simulated
phishing campaigns to test employee vigilance and reinforce
training.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Investigate and Remediate Localhost Exposure ( Port
22):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Assess External Exposure:</strong> Verify that the
interface and its services (specifically SSH on port 22) are not exposed
externally or to unauthorized internal network segments.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Review Justification:</strong> Determine the necessity of
SSH running on localhost. If it is required, ensure it is configured
with strong authentication (e.g., key-based authentication, disabled
root login, restricted access), and logging is enabled.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Patching and Updates:</strong> Ensure the SSH service and
underlying operating system are fully patched and up-to-date to mitigate
known vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Segmentation:</strong> If the localhost refers to an
internal server, ensure proper network segmentation is in place to limit
lateral movement if it were to be compromised.</p></li>
</ul></li>
