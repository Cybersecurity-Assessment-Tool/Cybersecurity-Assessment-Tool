<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive assessment of <strong>Golden
Gate Gaming</strong>’s cybersecurity posture, based on a recent network
scan, organizational security questionnaire responses, and a review of
existing known risks. The analysis reveals a mixed security posture with
notable strengths in email MFA, an acceptable use policy, and annual
security awareness training. However, critical gaps exist concerning the
lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and
sensitive data systems, as well as the absence of mandatory security
awareness training for new employees. The network scan identified no
open ports on the target <code>192.168.0.5</code>, which contradicts a
previously identified risk concerning an unencrypted web server on port
80. Key recommendations focus on implementing MFA across critical access
points, establishing new employee security training, and validating the
status of pre-existing risks.</p>

Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on the target system to identify open
ports and services.</p>

<li><p><strong>Scan Target:</strong> <code>192.168.0.5</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> (Date not provided in input, using
current date: 2026-01-27)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The scan identified the following status for probed ports:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 80 (HTTP):</strong> Closed</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> The Nmap scan of <code>192.168.0.5</code>
reported that all scanned ports, specifically port 80, were found to be
<strong>closed</strong>. No open ports with identifiable services,
products, or versions were discovered during this assessment.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section correlates findings from the organizational
questionnaire, technical scan, and existing risk data to provide a
comprehensive risk assessment.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="identified-security-gaps-from-questionnaire">Identified Security
Gaps (from Questionnaire)</h2>
<p>Based on the questionnaire responses, the following critical security
gaps were identified:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins:</strong> Not requiring
MFA for computer logins significantly increases the risk of unauthorized
access through compromised credentials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> Absence
of MFA for sensitive data systems poses a high risk of data breaches if
an attacker gains access to credentials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong> New employees are often prime targets for social
engineering attacks. Without immediate security awareness training, they
represent a significant vulnerability.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered"

<p><strong>Correlation Note:</strong> The existing risk "Unencrypted Web
Server" states that Port 80 is open. However, the current network scan
(Input 1) for <code>192.168.0.5</code> found Port 80 to be
<strong>closed</strong>. This discrepancy suggests that the existing
risk may refer to a different asset, a previously remediated state, or
an outdated finding. Further investigation is required to reconcile
this. Based on the current scan, this specific "Unencrypted Web Server"
risk is not presently active on the scanned target.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are provided to
improve <strong>Golden Gate Gaming</strong>’s cybersecurity posture:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Logins:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Deploy and enforce Multi-Factor
Authentication for all user accounts accessing company computers and
internal systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Significantly reduces the risk of
credential compromise leading to unauthorized system access.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Integrate MFA into all applications and
systems that store or process sensitive organizational data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Provides an additional layer of
security to protect critical data from breaches, even if primary
credentials are stolen.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop and implement a mandatory
cybersecurity awareness training program for all new hires, to be
completed as part of their onboarding process.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Equips new employees with the knowledge
to identify and report phishing attempts, social engineering, and other
common cyber threats, reducing human-factor risk.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Reconcile Existing Risk "Unencrypted Web
Server":</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Investigate the "Unencrypted Web Server"
risk. Confirm which asset it pertains to and its current status. If it
relates to <code>192.168.0.5</code>, verify if the remediation (closing
port 80 or implementing HTTPS) has been completed and the risk can be
retired. If it pertains to another asset, ensure that asset is properly
secured.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Ensures that the organization’s risk
register is accurate and reflects the current security posture,
preventing resources from being allocated to non-existent issues or
ignoring active ones.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Network Scanning:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Implement a schedule for regular,
authenticated network scans and vulnerability assessments to proactively
identify new exposures and changes in the environment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Provides continuous visibility into the
attack surface and helps identify new vulnerabilities before they can be
exploited.</p></li>
