<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of Aetheric Systems
based on provided organizational data, a security questionnaire, and a
basic network scan. The assessment reveals significant foundational
security gaps, particularly regarding Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
and employee security policies. While the initial network scan did not
identify any directly exploitable open ports, the identified internal
control weaknesses present a high risk profile. Immediate
recommendations focus on implementing robust MFA, establishing clear
security policies, and enhancing employee training. Addressing these
identified gaps is crucial for elevating the organization’s overall
security posture and reducing exposure to common cyber threats.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-questionnaire-findings">Analysis
of Questionnaire Findings</h2>
<p>The questionnaire highlights several critical gaps in Aetheric
Systems’ security controls. The most significant finding is the
widespread lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across email,
computer logins, and sensitive data systems. This leaves the
organization highly vulnerable to credential-based attacks. Furthermore,
the absence of an employee acceptable use policy and security awareness
training for new employees indicates a significant deficiency in
foundational human-centric security measures. While annual security
awareness training is conducted, its effectiveness and scope should be
reviewed in light of other identified gaps.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A basic network scan was performed using Nmap. The findings are as
follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Target:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not specified in the provided input
data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> The target host was reported as
<code>up</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports:</strong> No open ports were identified by
this specific Nmap scan. All extra ports were reported as
<code>closed</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of
Technical Findings</h2>
<p>The network scan indicates that the target host () is operational.
Crucially, the scan did not identify any open ports, suggesting a
relatively locked-down external posture from the perspective of this
specific scan. While this is a positive indicator for the immediate
external attack surface, it does not preclude the existence of
vulnerabilities within internal systems, web applications, or services
that may be filtered or were not within the scope of this basic scan.
Further, more comprehensive scanning and vulnerability assessments are
recommended.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the organizational data, security
questionnaire, and technical scan results, the following risks have been
identified:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align: left;"><strong>Risk ID</strong></th>
<th style="text-align: left;"><strong>Risk Name</strong></th>
<th style="text-align: left;"><strong>Severity</strong></th>
<th style="text-align: left;"><strong>Overview</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">R-001</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of MFA for Email Access</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">High</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Without Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA),
email accounts are highly susceptible to credential stuffing, phishing,
and brute-force attacks. Compromised email can lead to business email
compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and further network intrusion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">R-002</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of MFA for Computer Logins</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">High</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Similar to email, the absence of MFA for
computer logins significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access
to endpoints, potentially leading to malware infection, data access, and
lateral movement within the network.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">R-003</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data
Systems</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Critical</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Sensitive data systems, by definition,
contain critical information. Failure to protect these with MFA exposes
the organization to severe data breaches, regulatory penalties, and
reputational damage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">R-004</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Absence of Employee Acceptable Use
Policy</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">High</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Without a formal Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP), employees may unknowingly engage in activities that expose the
organization to legal, regulatory, or cybersecurity risks. This lack of
clear guidance can lead to misuse of company resources and data.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">R-005</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">No Security Awareness Training for New
Hires</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">High</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">New employees, lacking immediate security
awareness training, are more vulnerable to social engineering attacks
(e.g., phishing) and may not understand corporate security protocols,
posing an immediate risk to organizational security.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">R-006</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Undetected Technical Vulnerabilities</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Medium</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The provided network scan was limited in
scope. While no open ports were immediately identified, this does not
guarantee the absence of vulnerabilities in internal systems, web
applications, or services behind firewalls. Further assessment is
needed.</td>
