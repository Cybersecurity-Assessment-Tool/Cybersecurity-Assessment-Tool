<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for Signal Flare, combining insights from organizational security
practices, a targeted network scan, and existing risk data.</p>
<p>Signal Flare demonstrates a strong commitment to multi-factor
authentication (MFA) across critical access points, including email,
computer logins, and sensitive data systems. This significantly enhances
protection against unauthorized access.</p>
<p>However, key gaps in foundational security practices were identified:
the absence of an Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and the lack of
security awareness training for new employees pose substantial risks,
potentially leading to policy violations, data misuse, and
susceptibility to social engineering attacks from the outset of
employment.</p>
<p>A technical scan of the internal target <code>192.168.0.5</code>
revealed no open ports, indicating a secure configuration for this
specific host at the time of the scan. A pre-existing risk regarding an
unencrypted web server (Port 80 open) was noted in organizational
records; however, this specific condition was not confirmed on the
scanned host during this assessment, suggesting it might apply to a
different asset or has been remediated.</p>
<p>Recommendations focus on establishing critical policies and training
programs, alongside validating existing risk information.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="control-gaps-identified">Control Gaps
Identified</h2>
<p>Based on the questionnaire, two significant control gaps were
identified:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong>
Without a formal AUP, employees may be unaware of the proper and
prohibited uses of organizational IT resources, data, and communication
systems. This can lead to compliance violations, data exfiltration, or
introduction of malware.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of New Employee Security Awareness
Training:</strong> While annual training for all employees is conducted,
the absence of initial security awareness training for new hires means
that new staff members might operate without fundamental security
knowledge from their first day, making them vulnerable targets for
social engineering, phishing, and other common attacks.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on the specified internal target to
identify open ports and services.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="scanned-target">Scanned Target: </h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> The target host was found to be
active (up).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports Detected:</strong> None. The scan identified
no open ports on <code>192.168.0.5</code>. Specifically, Port 80 was
found to be <code>closed</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Services/Versions Identified:</strong> Due to the absence
of open ports, no services or versions could be identified on this
host.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: Scan date was not provided in the input data.</em></p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To strengthen Signal Flare’s cybersecurity posture, the following
actionable recommendations are provided:</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="immediate-actions">Immediate Actions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Draft a clear, comprehensive AUP that defines acceptable and
unacceptable use of company IT assets, networks, and data.</p></li>
<li><p>Obtain legal review and management approval.</p></li>
<li><p>Disseminate the AUP to all employees, requiring acknowledgment of
understanding and compliance.</p></li>
<li><p>Integrate AUP review into annual employee training.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Mandatory New Employee Security Awareness
Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop a foundational security awareness training module
specifically for new hires.</p></li>
<li><p>Make completion of this training a mandatory part of the
onboarding process, prior to granting access to critical
systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Cover topics such as phishing, password hygiene, data handling,
and reporting suspicious activities.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Validate "Unencrypted Web Server" Risk:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Review the scope and applicability of the existing "Unencrypted
Web Server" risk (severity 5.0).</p></li>
<li><p>Confirm whether this risk applies to a different asset within the
organization, or if it was remediated on since the risk was first
identified.</p></li>
<li><p>If applicable to other assets, prioritize remediation efforts
such as implementing HTTPS/SSL certificates.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="long-term-strategy">Long-Term Strategy</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Regular Policy Review and Updates:</strong> Ensure that
all security policies, including the AUP, are reviewed and updated
annually or whenever significant changes in technology, threats, or
regulations occur.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Continuous Security Awareness Program
Enhancement:</strong> Beyond initial and annual training, consider
implementing regular security bulletins, phishing simulations, and
targeted micro-trainings to keep security top-of-mind for all
employees.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Periodic Internal Network Scans:</strong> Conduct regular
internal network scans across various segments to proactively identify
potential vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or unauthorized services
before they can be exploited.</p></li>
