<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report outlines the cybersecurity posture assessment for
Terraform Global, synthesizing data from a recent network scan,
responses to an organizational security questionnaire, and an inventory
of pre-existing risks. The analysis reveals critical vulnerabilities
stemming from insufficient Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
implementation and a lack of comprehensive security awareness training
for employees. While a recent network scan confirmed the absence of
immediately exposed services on a key internal target, thereby
mitigating a previously identified risk, the organizational controls
require significant enhancement to bolster overall resilience against
prevalent cyber threats. Recommendations are provided to address these
gaps, focusing on strengthening identity and access management through
universal MFA adoption and establishing robust employee training
programs.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-control-gaps">Analysis of Control
Gaps</h2>
<p>The questionnaire responses highlight critical deficiencies in two
primary areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</strong>: MFA is not
consistently applied across the organization. It is notably absent for
general computer logins (SC-02) and access to systems containing
sensitive data (SC-03). This significantly elevates the risk of
unauthorized access should user credentials become compromised through
phishing or other means.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Security Awareness Training</strong>: There is a clear
lack of formal security awareness training programs. Specifically, new
employees do not receive mandated training (SC-05), and there is no
annual recurring training for the entire workforce (SC-06). This leaves
employees vulnerable to social engineering, phishing attacks, and other
human-centric exploits, which can often be the initial vector for
sophisticated attacks.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>A recent network scan was performed on the internal target .</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address</strong>:</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date</strong>: N/A (Scan date was not provided in
the metadata)</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="findings">Findings</h2>
<p>The scan identified no open ports on the target host. Specifically,
port 80, which is commonly associated with unencrypted web services, was
found to be <strong>closed</strong>. This is a positive finding,
indicating that the scanned system is not currently exposing services
publicly on common, easily discoverable ports. There were no services
identified that would indicate outdated software versions or dangerous
configurations based solely on port status.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section integrates the identified control gaps from the
questionnaire, the findings from the technical scan, and existing risk
inventory data to present a holistic view of Terraform Global’s risk
landscape.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To significantly enhance Terraform Global’s cybersecurity posture and
mitigate the identified risks, the following actionable recommendations
are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Universally</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Prioritize and implement MFA for all employee computer logins to
prevent unauthorized access even if passwords are stolen.</p></li>
<li><p>Extend MFA requirements to all systems storing or processing
sensitive organizational data, ensuring critical assets are protected by
a strong authentication layer.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct a comprehensive audit to identify all systems that would
benefit from MFA and develop a phased rollout plan.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Comprehensive Security Awareness Training
Programs</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and mandate security awareness training for all new
employees as a critical component of their onboarding process, covering
fundamental cybersecurity principles.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement a mandatory annual security awareness training program
for all existing employees, focusing on current threat landscapes,
phishing recognition, social engineering tactics, and safe computing
practices.</p></li>
<li><p>Include periodic phishing simulations and interactive modules to
test and reinforce training effectiveness and maintain employee
vigilance.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Regularly Review and Update Risk
Assessments</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Continue to conduct periodic technical vulnerability scans and
penetration tests to validate the state of network services and
infrastructure, identifying new exposures promptly.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure that the pre-existing risk inventory is regularly reviewed
and cross-referenced with current technical scan data and organizational
changes to accurately reflect the active threat landscape.</p></li>
<li><p>Update internal security policies and controls promptly to
reflect new findings and implement effective mitigation strategies for
identified risks.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Proactive Vulnerability Management</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>While the current scan found no open ports, implement continuous
monitoring to detect any unauthorized service exposures.</p></li>
<li><p>Establish a robust patch management program to ensure all
operating systems and applications are regularly updated to protect
against known vulnerabilities.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Terraform Global has established some foundational security controls,
such as an acceptable use policy and MFA for email. However, the
assessment reveals critical vulnerabilities in the broader adoption of
MFA and the absence of a comprehensive security awareness training
program. Addressing these fundamental gaps proactively through the
outlined recommendations will significantly enhance the organization’s
resilience against a wide range of cyber threats, foster a stronger
security culture, and protect its valuable assets.</p>
