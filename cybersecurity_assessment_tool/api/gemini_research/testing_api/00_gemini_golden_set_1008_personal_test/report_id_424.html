<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a cybersecurity posture assessment for Modern
Myth, based on organizational self-assessment, technical network scans,
and an review of existing risks. The organization demonstrates good
foundational practices in employee acceptable use policies and security
awareness training. However, critical security gaps have been
identified, most notably the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
for email access and computer logins, which represents a significant
attack vector for account compromise. Technical analysis of the provided
network scan data revealed that the targeted internal host () did not
expose any open ports, indicating a positive security posture for that
specific system regarding network services. No pre-existing
vulnerabilities were reported. Addressing the MFA deficiencies is
paramount to significantly enhance the overall security posture and
mitigate high-impact risks.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-security-control-gaps">Analysis
of Security Control Gaps</h2>
<p>The "No" answers to critical security control questions highlight
significant vulnerabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Email Access:</strong> Without MFA,
compromised credentials (e.g., via phishing) can grant attackers full
access to employee inboxes, leading to business email compromise (BEC),
data exfiltration, or further internal compromise. This is a
<strong>High Risk</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Computer Login:</strong> Similar to
email, the absence of MFA for computer logins makes systems susceptible
to brute-force attacks or credential stuffing, potentially leading to
unauthorized access to internal networks and sensitive data. This is a
<strong>High Risk</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">3. Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed using Nmap on the target .</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not provided in scan data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> Up</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports and Services:</strong> The scan reported no
open ports on the target host. All extra ports were reported as
closed.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-technical-scan-findings">Analysis
of Technical Scan Findings</h2>
<p>The finding that the target host () has no open ports visible to the
scanner is a positive security indicator. This suggests that the system
is either well-hardened, not intended to run network services, or
protected by a firewall that blocks all unsolicited inbound connections.
While this is good for external attack surface reduction, it is
important to remember that internal compromise could still occur through
other vectors (e.g., phishing, malware execution) and an internal scan
might reveal different results. No specific service vulnerabilities were
identified due to the lack of open ports.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">5. Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and enhance Modern Myth’s
cybersecurity posture, the following recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email
Access (High Priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Deploy a robust MFA solution for all email accounts (e.g.,
Microsoft 365, Google Workspace).</p></li>
<li><p>Mandate MFA enrollment for all users, including administrative
accounts.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide clear instructions and support for user enrollment and
usage.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer
Logins (High Priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement MFA for logging into all company computers, especially
those accessing sensitive data or the primary network. This can be
achieved through solutions integrated with Active Directory, identity
providers, or endpoint security tools.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all users are required to use MFA for workstation and
server logins.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Regular Internal Network Scans:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>While the current scan of showed no open ports, this was a single
host. Regularly scan all internal network segments to identify
unauthorized devices, open ports, and misconfigured services.</p></li>
<li><p>Perform authenticated vulnerability scans to detect
vulnerabilities on operating systems and applications running on
internal hosts.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Review and Update Security Policies
Regularly:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Although an acceptable use policy is in place, regularly review
and update all security policies to reflect current threats and best
practices.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure policies are communicated effectively to all
employees.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Enhance Security Awareness Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Continue and expand security awareness training, with a specific
focus on the importance of MFA, phishing recognition, and strong
password hygiene.</p></li>
<li><p>Include simulated phishing exercises to test employee resilience
against real-world threats.</p></li>
</ul></li>
