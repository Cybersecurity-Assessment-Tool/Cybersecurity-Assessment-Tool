<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of <strong>Crestview
Analytics</strong>, based on a review of organizational security
controls, a network scan, and an assessment of pre-existing risks. Key
findings indicate significant gaps in Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
implementation across critical access points (email, computer logins,
sensitive data systems). While some foundational security awareness
training is in place for new employees, annual refresher training for
all employees is lacking. A network scan identified an open SSH port on
the target, which, while not immediately indicative of a vulnerability
without further context (e.g., version, configuration), represents a
potential attack surface. No pre-existing vulnerabilities were reported
by the organization. Recommendations are provided to address these
identified areas of concern and enhance the overall security
posture.</p>

<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not provided in scan

<p>The scan identified the following open ports on the target host:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 22/TCP (SSH):</strong> This port is typically used
for Secure Shell (SSH) access, which provides a secure channel over an
unsecured network. No specific service, product, or version information
was identified during this scan.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Without further context regarding the target’s role (e.g., whether it
is internet-facing or internal, and its specific function), the presence
of an open SSH port suggests a potential access point. Proper
configuration, strong authentication (preferably with MFA or key-based
authentication), and regular patching are crucial for any system
exposing SSH.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To enhance the overall cybersecurity posture of Crestview Analytics,
the following actionable recommendations are provided:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Priority 1:</em> Immediately implement MFA for all email
access to prevent account compromise from phishing or credential
stuffing attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Priority 2:</em> Roll out MFA for all computer logins across
the organization to secure endpoints against unauthorized
access.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Priority 3:</em> Extend MFA requirements to all sensitive
data systems and critical applications to protect valuable
organizational assets.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Enhance Security Awareness Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Establish a mandatory annual security awareness training program
for all employees to ensure they are regularly updated on evolving
threats, company policies, and best practices (e.g., phishing detection,
password hygiene, incident reporting).</p></li>
<li><p>Consider incorporating phishing simulation exercises as part of
the training regimen to test and reinforce employee vigilance.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Secure SSH Services:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the SSH service on is publicly accessible or exposed to
untrusted networks, implement strict firewall rules to restrict access
to only necessary source IP addresses.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure strong, unique, and complex passwords are enforced for all
SSH accounts, or ideally, migrate to key-based authentication with
strong passphrases.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement MFA for SSH access if the SSH server software supports
it, providing an additional layer of security.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep SSH server software patched to the latest stable version to
mitigate known vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p>Regularly review SSH configurations for best practices, such as
disabling root login, changing the default SSH port, and configuring
strict login attempt limits.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Vulnerability Management:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement a regular vulnerability scanning and penetration
testing program to proactively identify and address technical weaknesses
across the IT infrastructure.</p></li>
<li><p>Establish a formal process for tracking, prioritizing, and
remediating identified vulnerabilities within defined service-level
agreements (SLAs).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Maintain an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Regularly review and update the existing AUP to reflect current
technologies, threats, and organizational policies.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all employees acknowledge and understand the AUP annually,
reinforcing their responsibilities regarding secure technology
use.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>While Crestview Analytics has some foundational security measures in
place, particularly an acceptable use policy and initial employee
security training, there are critical weaknesses in its current
cybersecurity posture, primarily the pervasive lack of Multi-Factor
Authentication and insufficient recurring security awareness training.
Addressing these high-priority items, alongside securing identified open
services like SSH and implementing a robust vulnerability management
program, will significantly improve the organization’s resilience
against modern cyber threats. Proactive implementation of these
recommendations is crucial for strengthening the overall security
posture and protecting organizational assets.</p>
