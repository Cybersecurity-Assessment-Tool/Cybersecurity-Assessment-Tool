<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of <strong>Blue
Marble</strong>, based on a review of organizational security controls,
a targeted network scan, and an assessment of reported existing
risks.</p>
<p>The analysis indicates a commendable focus on foundational security
practices, with robust employee acceptable use policies and regular
security awareness training. The network scan of the target
<code>192.168.1.100</code> showed no open ports, which is generally a
positive indicator for a hardened system or one not intended for public
access.</p>
<p>However, critical gaps were identified concerning Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) implementation. Specifically, MFA is not required
for computer logins or for accessing sensitive data systems. These
omissions represent significant vulnerabilities that could lead to
unauthorized access in the event of compromised credentials. No
pre-existing vulnerabilities were reported by the organization.</p>
<p>Recommendations focus on immediate implementation of MFA across all
critical access points and the establishment of a continuous
vulnerability management program to proactively identify and mitigate
risks.</p>

<h2 id="key-findings-from-security-control-review">Key Findings from
Security Control Review</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA for Email:</strong> Successfully implemented, a
strong control against phishing and credential stuffing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>MFA for Computer Logins:</strong> <strong>Critical
Gap.</strong> The absence of MFA for computer logins significantly
increases the risk of unauthorized access if user credentials are stolen
or compromised.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> <strong>Critical
Gap.</strong> Similar to computer logins, the lack of MFA for sensitive
data systems exposes high-value assets to elevated risks from
compromised credentials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> In place,
providing clear guidelines for employee behavior and system
usage.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Security Awareness Training (SAT):</strong> Consistent
training for both new and all employees annually demonstrates a
commitment to building a security-aware culture.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed using Nmap against the specified
target.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scanner:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not Provided</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="scan-findings">Scan Findings</h2>
<p>The Nmap scan of the target <code>192.168.1.100</code> indicated that
the host is up, but no open ports were identified. All extra ports were
reported as closed.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Status:</strong> Host is Up</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports:</strong> None found</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Extra Ports State:</strong> Closed</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This finding is generally positive, suggesting that the target system
either has a well-configured firewall blocking all external access
attempts or that no services are running on standard ports. Without
further context (e.g., if this is an internal or external target, and
what services are expected to be running), it’s difficult to draw more
definitive conclusions. However, from an external attack surface
perspective, having no open ports is ideal.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>

vulnerabilities have been identified:</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To strengthen Blue Marble’s cybersecurity posture, the following
recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer
Logins:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Mandate MFA for all user logins to
company computers, laptops, and virtual desktops.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rationale:</strong> This significantly reduces the risk
of unauthorized access due to stolen or weak passwords, making it much
harder for attackers to compromise user accounts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> Immediate</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive
Data Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Extend MFA requirements to all systems,
applications, and databases that store, process, or transmit sensitive
organizational or customer data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rationale:</strong> This protects critical assets and
sensitive information from credential-based attacks, providing an
essential layer of security.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> Immediate</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Continuous Vulnerability
Management:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Implement a formal process for regularly
identifying, assessing, and remediating vulnerabilities across all IT
assets. This should include periodic internal and external network
scans, penetration testing, and software patching cycles.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Proactive vulnerability management
helps prevent exploitation of known weaknesses and maintains a secure
operational environment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> High</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Clarify Network Scan Scope and Context:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Provide context for the target
<code>192.168.1.100</code>, including whether it is an internal or
external facing host, its intended function, and any expected
services.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rationale:</strong> While no open ports were found,
understanding the target’s role helps confirm if this is the expected
and desired security posture.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> Medium</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Blue Marble has established a solid foundation in security awareness
and policy enforcement. However, the lack of MFA for internal computer
logins and sensitive data access represents critical vulnerabilities
that must be addressed promptly. By implementing the recommended MFA
controls and establishing a robust vulnerability management program,
Blue Marble can significantly enhance its overall cybersecurity posture
and better protect its assets from evolving threats.</p>
