<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
based on organizational data, security questionnaire responses, and
technical scan results. The analysis reveals several critical gaps
primarily related to multi-factor authentication (MFA) implementation
and security awareness training. While no technical vulnerabilities were
identified due to the absence of scan data, the identified policy and
training deficiencies represent significant risks to the organization’s
security. Immediate attention is recommended for implementing robust MFA
across all critical systems and establishing a continuous security
awareness program.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and improve the overall cybersecurity
posture, the following recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
Workstation Access:</strong> Mandate MFA for all user logins to company
computers and workstations. This adds a crucial layer of security,
significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access due to stolen or
weak passwords.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive
Data Systems:</strong> Enforce MFA for access to all systems containing
sensitive organizational or customer data. This protects critical
information assets from compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Onboarding Security Awareness
Training:</strong> Develop and implement a mandatory security awareness
training program for all new employees during their onboarding process.
This ensures that new hires are immediately aware of security policies,
best practices, and potential threats.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Annual Security Awareness Training:</strong>
Develop and implement a comprehensive, recurring security awareness
training program for all employees, conducted at least once per year.
This will keep employees informed about current threats (e.g., phishing,
ransomware), reinforce security best practices, and maintain a strong
security culture.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Regular Technical Vulnerability Scans:</strong>
Although no scan data was available for this report, it is highly
recommended that the organization regularly perform external and
internal network vulnerability scans to identify and remediate technical
weaknesses in its infrastructure and applications.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The assessment highlights that while some foundational security
controls are in place (e.g., MFA for email, AUP), significant
vulnerabilities exist in the areas of comprehensive MFA adoption and
ongoing security awareness training. Addressing these critical and
high-severity risks through the recommended actions will substantially
strengthen Aetheric Systems’ cybersecurity defenses and resilience
against common attack vectors. Continuous monitoring and regular
security assessments are essential for maintaining a robust security
posture.</p>
