<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This document presents a cybersecurity posture assessment for
<strong>Iron Oak Furniture</strong>. The assessment is based on the
analysis of organizational security questionnaire responses. It aims to
identify potential vulnerabilities, assess current risks, and provide
actionable recommendations to improve the organization’s cybersecurity
resilience. Due to issues with the provided input data, specific
technical scan results and a comprehensive list of pre-existing
organizational risks could not be included in this report.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-security-control-gaps">Analysis of Security Control
Gaps</h2>
<p>Based on the questionnaire, the following significant gaps were
identified:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Email Access:</strong> Not requiring MFA
for email significantly increases the risk of account compromise through
phishing or credential stuffing attacks. Email is often a primary vector
for initial access and business email compromise (BEC).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Without a formal AUP, employees may not be aware of
their responsibilities regarding the use of company IT resources, data
handling, and secure computing practices. This can lead to increased
risks of data loss, malware infections, and compliance issues.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training:</strong>
While new employees receive training, the lack of ongoing annual
training for all employees means that critical security information may
not be reinforced or updated. This can result in a decline in security
posture over time as threats evolve.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<h2 id="network-scan-findings">Network Scan Findings</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, the provided network scan data
(‘Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON‘) was malformed and could not be processed
for analysis. Therefore, no technical vulnerabilities or open port
details can be reported from a network scan perspective.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP:</strong> <code>[Target IP]</code> (No specific
target IP could be extracted from the malformed input.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Data unavailable.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports and Services:</strong> No information
available. <strong>Product Versions:</strong> No information
available.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is strongly recommended that a valid network scan be performed and
provided for future assessments to gain a comprehensive understanding of
the external attack surface.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the available organizational data and security control
review, the following risks have been identified. Note that a complete
risk assessment requires technical scan data and pre-existing
vulnerability information, which were unavailable.</p>

<th style="text-align: left;"><strong>Severity</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of MFA for Email</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Without MFA, email accounts are highly
susceptible to credential theft and compromise, leading to phishing,
data breaches, and business email compromise (BEC) attacks. This is a
critical initial access vector for attackers.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">High</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Absence of Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP)</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of an AUP means employees may not be
aware of expected behavior regarding IT asset usage, data handling, and
internet browsing. This increases risks of data loss, malware infection,
and potential legal liabilities due to inappropriate use.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Medium</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Insufficient Annual Security Awareness
Training</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Without regular and mandatory training,
employees are less likely to recognize and report evolving social
engineering attacks (e.g., sophisticated phishing). This leaves the
organization vulnerable to human-factor exploits and reduces overall
security hygiene.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">High</td>
</tr>

</div>
<h2 id="pre-existing-vulnerabilities">Pre-existing Vulnerabilities</h2>
<p>The provided ‘Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON‘ was malformed and could not
be processed. Therefore, no pre-existing vulnerabilities or known risks
from internal records are included in this report. This significantly
limits the scope of the overall risk assessment.</p>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and improve the overall
cybersecurity posture, the following recommendations are provided:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
Email:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Make MFA mandatory for all employee email accounts
immediately.</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluate and implement a robust MFA solution that supports
various methods (e.g., authenticator apps, hardware tokens).</p></li>
<li><p>Provide clear instructions and support to employees during the
rollout.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Draft a comprehensive AUP that clearly outlines employee
responsibilities regarding IT asset usage, data classification and
handling, internet browsing, software installation, and incident
reporting.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all employees read, understand, and formally acknowledge
the AUP upon hiring and periodically thereafter.</p></li>
<li><p>Integrate AUP review into annual security awareness
training.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Mandatory Annual Security Awareness Training
for All Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and implement a recurring (at least annual) security
awareness training program for all employees, not just new
hires.</p></li>
<li><p>The training should cover current threat landscapes, including
advanced phishing techniques, social engineering, ransomware, password
best practices, data protection, and incident reporting
procedures.</p></li>
<li><p>Use engaging and interactive training methods to improve
retention.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Address Data Input Issues for Future
Assessments:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ensure all future data inputs for cybersecurity assessments
(e.g., network scans, vulnerability lists) are provided in valid and
complete formats (e.g., proper JSON structure). This will enable a more
thorough and accurate assessment of the organization’s cybersecurity
posture.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>While <strong>Iron Oak Furniture</strong> demonstrates some
foundational security controls, there are critical gaps that expose the
organization to significant cybersecurity risks. The most pressing
issues revolve around the lack of MFA for email, the absence of an
acceptable use policy, and insufficient ongoing security awareness
training. Addressing these areas, as outlined in the recommendations,
will substantially enhance the organization’s defense against common
attack vectors. A complete cybersecurity assessment, including technical
scans and known vulnerability data, is highly recommended once valid
input data can be provided.</p>
