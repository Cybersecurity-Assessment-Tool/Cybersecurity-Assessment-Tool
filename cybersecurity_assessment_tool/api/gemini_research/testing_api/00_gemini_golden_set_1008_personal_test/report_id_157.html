<h1 class="unnumbered" id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for Brimstone Manufacturing, based on a combination of network scan
data, organizational security questionnaire responses, and a review of
existing risks. The analysis reveals a generally proactive approach to
foundational security controls, as evidenced by strong MFA adoption and
security awareness initiatives. However, specific technical
vulnerabilities related to outdated software and certificate
misconfiguration were identified, posing potential risks to the
organization’s digital assets. This report details these findings and
provides actionable recommendations to enhance the overall security
posture.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-security-controls">Analysis of
Security Controls</h2>
<p>Brimstone Manufacturing demonstrates a commendable commitment to
foundational security practices, particularly concerning Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) across critical access points (email, computers,
sensitive data systems). The presence of an acceptable use policy and
regular security awareness training further indicates a strong emphasis
on human-centric security. These controls are crucial for mitigating
common threats such as phishing and unauthorized access.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was conducted on the target system on
<code>2025-11-22T10:00:00Z</code>. The scan identified an active host
with the following open port and service details:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Port:</strong> 443/TCP (HTTPS)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Service:</strong> HTTPS</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Product:</strong> Nginx</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.18.0</p></li>
<li><p><strong>SSL Certificate Subject:</strong>
commonName=www.acme-corp.com</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="technical-analysis">Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>The scan revealed an Nginx web server running version 1.18.0 on port
443 (HTTPS). Nginx 1.18.0 was released in April 2020 and is considered
an older stable version; it is no longer actively maintained by the
Nginx project, which has since released multiple newer stable versions
(e.g., 1.24.x, 1.26.x). Running outdated software exposes the
organization to known vulnerabilities for which patches are available in
newer releases, increasing the risk of exploitation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the SSL/TLS certificate presented by the service has a
common name of ‘www.acme-corp.com‘. This does not match the
organization’s domain ‘BrimstoneManufacturing.net‘. This discrepancy can
lead to trust warnings for users accessing the service and may indicate
a misconfiguration, a reverse proxy setup for a different entity, or an
incorrectly deployed certificate for the intended service.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the questionnaire and technical scan data,
the following risks have been identified:</p>

<td style="text-align: left;">Nginx 1.18.0 is an older stable version
that is no longer actively maintained. This poses a risk as it may
contain known security vulnerabilities that have been addressed in newer
releases, increasing the attack surface.</td>

name (‘www.acme-corp.com‘) that does not match
‘BrimstoneManufacturing.net‘. This can cause trust issues for users,
hinder secure communication, and suggests a potential
misconfiguration.</td>

</div>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and further enhance Brimstone
Manufacturing’s cybersecurity posture, the following recommendations are
provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade Nginx Web Server:</strong> Urgently upgrade the
Nginx web server on to the latest stable or mainline version (e.g.,
1.24.x or 1.26.x). This will ensure the server benefits from the latest
security patches, bug fixes, and performance improvements, significantly
reducing the risk associated with known vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Review and Correct SSL/TLS Certificate:</strong>
Investigate the SSL/TLS certificate configuration for the service hosted
on . Ensure that a valid certificate matching the intended domain
(<code>BrimstoneManufacturing.net</code>) is properly installed and
configured. If the service is intentionally proxying another domain,
ensure this setup is correctly secured and documented, and user
expectations are managed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Regular Software Patching Policy:</strong>
Establish and enforce a robust patching and update policy for all
internet-facing services and critical internal infrastructure. This
includes operating systems, web servers, databases, and application
software. Automate patching where feasible.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Continuous Vulnerability Management:</strong> Implement a
continuous vulnerability scanning and management program to regularly
identify and remediate security weaknesses across the IT
infrastructure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Maintain Strong Security Controls:</strong> Continue to
enforce the strong security policies identified in the questionnaire,
including mandatory MFA for all critical access points, a comprehensive
acceptable use policy, and regular, comprehensive security awareness
training for all employees.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Brimstone Manufacturing has established a strong foundation of
security controls, particularly in areas of access management and
employee awareness. However, the identified technical issues regarding
outdated software and certificate misconfiguration on a public-facing
service present tangible risks. Addressing these specific
vulnerabilities promptly will significantly strengthen the
organization’s defense against potential cyber threats and reinforce its
overall security posture. Regular review and proactive management of
both technical and organizational controls are essential for maintaining
resilience in the evolving threat landscape.</p>
