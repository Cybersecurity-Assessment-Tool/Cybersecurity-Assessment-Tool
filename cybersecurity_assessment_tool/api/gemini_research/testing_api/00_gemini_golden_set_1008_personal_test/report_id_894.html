<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for <strong>Oasis Wellness</strong>, leveraging network scan data,
organizational security questionnaire responses, and a list of current
risks. The objective is to identify vulnerabilities, critical gaps, and
recommend actionable steps to enhance the overall security stance
against modern cyber threats.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following details were provided for the organization under
review:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Organization Name:</strong> Oasis Wellness</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Email Domain:</strong>
<code>OasisWellness.org</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Website Domain:</strong> <a href="www.OasisWellness.org"
class="uri">www.OasisWellness.org</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>External IP Address:</strong>
<code>181.170.202.135</code></p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="overview-of-security-posture">Overview of Security Posture</h1>
<p>Oasis Wellness demonstrates a mixed security posture. While the
organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
computer logins and conducts regular security awareness training,
critical gaps exist concerning MFA for email and sensitive data systems,
and the absence of a formal employee acceptable use policy. Technical
scans on the specified internal target indicate no currently open ports.
However, a pre-existing risk regarding an "Unencrypted Web Server" has
been noted, which requires further investigation given the current
technical scan results.</p>
<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A review of key security controls, based on the provided
questionnaire responses, is summarized below. A indicates the control is
reported to be in place, while an indicates it is not.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on the target <code>192.168.0.5</code>.
The scan results are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP:</strong> <code>192.168.0.5</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> N/A (scan date was not provided in
the input data)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports and Services:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The scan identified no open ports on the target
<code>192.168.0.5</code>. Specifically, port 80 was found to be
<strong>closed</strong>.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>These findings indicate that the directly scanned internal asset is
not currently exposing any network services via open ports, which is a
positive security indicator for this specific host.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section correlates findings from the questionnaire, technical
scan, and pre-existing risk data to provide a comprehensive view of the
organization’s risk landscape.</p>
<h2 id="identified-critical-gaps-from-questionnaire">Identified Critical
Gaps (from Questionnaire)</h2>
<p>Based on the security control review, the following critical gaps
have been identified, posing significant risks to the organization’s
security and data integrity:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Email Access:</strong> Without
Multi-Factor Authentication, email accounts are highly susceptible to
credential stuffing, phishing, and brute-force attacks. A compromise
could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and business email
compromise (BEC), which often results in financial losses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> Failure
to enforce MFA on systems containing sensitive organizational or client
data significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access should
credentials become compromised. This could lead to data exfiltration,
regulatory non-compliance, and severe reputational damage.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong>
An AUP is a foundational policy for setting clear expectations for
employee conduct regarding IT assets and data. Its absence can lead to
misuse of resources, increased risk of malware infections, data leakage
through improper handling, and potential legal liabilities due to
unauthorized activities.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pre-existing-risks-from-provided-data">Pre-existing Risks (from
Provided Data)</h2>
<p>The following risk was provided as a current vulnerability for the
organization:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Risk Name:</strong> Unencrypted Web Server</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Overview:</strong> Port 80 is open.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Severity (CVSS Score):</strong> 5.0 (Medium)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Affected Elements:</strong> Port 80</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Analyst Note:</strong> The recent network scan of target
<code>192.168.0.5</code> explicitly found port 80 to be
<strong>closed</strong>. This discrepancy suggests that either this
specific risk has been mitigated on the scanned asset, or the risk
pertains to a different web server (e.g., an external-facing server or
another internal asset within the organization) that was not part of the
current Nmap scan. Further investigation is critically required to
confirm the applicability and current status of this risk.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and critical gaps, and to improve
the overall cybersecurity posture, the following actionable
recommendations are provided:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Access:</strong> Mandate
Multi-Factor Authentication for all employee email accounts. This is a
fundamental control to significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized
access, even if passwords are compromised through phishing or other
means.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong>
Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication for all systems that store, process,
or transmit sensitive organizational or client data. Prioritize systems
based on data classification and impact.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a comprehensive AUP outlining acceptable use of
company IT resources, internet, email, and data handling practices.
Ensure all employees are thoroughly trained on, and formally
acknowledge, this policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Investigate "Unencrypted Web Server" Risk:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Verify if the "Unencrypted Web Server" risk pertains to an asset
other than <code>192.168.0.5</code>, specifically any external-facing
web servers or other internal servers that may not have been in scope
for the provided Nmap scan.</p></li>
<li><p>If the risk is still valid for an existing server, immediately
ensure all web traffic is encrypted using HTTPS with up-to-date and
properly configured SSL/TLS certificates. Redirect all HTTP traffic to
HTTPS.</p></li>
<li><p>If the risk was indeed tied to the scanned asset
<code>192.168.0.5</code> and port 80 is now confirmed closed and
unnecessary, formally document the mitigation and close the risk in the
risk register.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Continue and Enhance Security Awareness
Training:</strong> Maintain and regularly update the existing security
awareness training programs for all employees. Emphasize identification
of emerging threats like phishing, social engineering tactics, and the
importance of strong password hygiene and MFA.</p></li>
