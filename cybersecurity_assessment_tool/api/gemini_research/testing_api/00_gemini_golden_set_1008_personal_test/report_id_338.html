<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings from a recent cybersecurity posture
assessment conducted for Ironclad Logistics. The assessment involved a
review of organizational security controls via a questionnaire, a
targeted network scan of an internal asset, and an evaluation of
pre-existing risk information.</p>
<p>Key findings indicate several critical vulnerabilities and
significant gaps. Most notably, an internal system running an outdated
FTP service (<code>vsftpd 2.3.4</code>) was found allowing
<strong>anonymous login</strong>. This represents an immediate and
severe risk. Furthermore, the organization lacks Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for email access and does not conduct security
awareness training for new employees, leaving critical attack vectors
open. Existing risks include an outdated Windows policy with computers
running Windows 7. Comprehensive recommendations are provided to address
these issues and strengthen the overall security posture.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following information was provided by Ironclad Logistics to
establish the context for this assessment.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Organization Name:</strong> Ironclad Logistics</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Email Domain:</strong>
<code>IroncladLogistics.net</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Website Domain:</strong>
<code>www.IroncladLogistics.net</code></p></li>

</ul>
<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A questionnaire was used to assess the current state of key security
controls within Ironclad Logistics. The responses are summarized
below:</p>
<div class="longtable">
<p><span>p<span>0.7</span> c</span> <strong>Security Control
Question</strong> &amp; <strong>Status</strong><br />
<br />
Do you require MFA to access email? &amp;<br />
Do you require MFA to log into computers? &amp;<br />
Do you require MFA to access sensitive data systems? &amp;<br />
Does your organization have an employee acceptable use policy?
&amp;<br />
Does your organization do security awareness training for new employees?
&amp;<br />
Does your organization do security awareness training for all employees
at least once per year? &amp;<br />
</p>
</div>
<h2 id="analysis-of-security-control-gaps">Analysis of Security Control
Gaps</h2>
<p>The review highlights two significant control gaps:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>No MFA for Email Access:</strong> Email is a primary
vector for phishing and account compromise. Without MFA, a simple
password compromise can lead to full access to an employee’s email,
potentially enabling further attacks like business email compromise
(BEC).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong> New employees are particularly vulnerable to social
engineering and phishing attacks as they may not be familiar with
organizational security policies and common threats. Lack of initial
training increases the risk of successful attacks.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed against the specified target IP address.
The scan revealed critical findings.</p>

</p>
</div>
<h2 id="detailed-technical-analysis">Detailed Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>The scan identified an FTP service running on port 21.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Service Name:</strong> FTP (File Transfer
Protocol)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Product:</strong> <code>vsftpd</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Version:</strong> <code>2.3.4</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Critical Finding:</strong> The service allows
<strong>Anonymous FTP login</strong>. This means anyone can connect to
the FTP server without credentials and potentially upload, download, or
modify files, leading to data breaches, data corruption, or even system
compromise via malware upload.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><code>vsftpd 2.3.4</code> is an extremely outdated version released
in 2011 and is known to have critical vulnerabilities, including a
backdoor (CVE-2011-2523) that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary
commands. This, combined with anonymous access, poses a severe and
immediate threat to the system and potentially the wider network.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>

<strong>Risk Name</strong> &amp; <strong>Overview</strong> &amp;
<strong>Severity</strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="color: critical">Anonymous FTP
Access</span></strong> &amp; An internal system is running FTP (vsftpd
2.3.4) and allows anonymous login. This permits unauthorized access to
the FTP server, potentially leading to data exfiltration, unauthorized
uploads (e.g., malware), or system compromise. &amp; <span
style="color: critical">Critical</span><br />
<strong><span style="color: critical">Outdated vsftpd
Version</span></strong> &amp; The vsftpd 2.3.4 service is severely
outdated (released 2011) and contains critical known vulnerabilities,
including a backdoor (CVE-2011-2523) that allows arbitrary command
execution. This significantly increases the risk of system compromise.
&amp; <span style="color: critical">Critical</span><br />
<strong><span style="color: high">No MFA for Email
Access</span></strong> &amp; User email accounts are not protected by
Multi-Factor Authentication. This makes them highly susceptible to
phishing and password-guessing attacks, potentially leading to account
takeover and Business Email Compromise (BEC). &amp; <span
style="color: high">High</span><br />
<strong><span style="color: high">No Security Awareness Training for New
Employees</span></strong> &amp; New hires are not receiving initial
security awareness training. This increases their susceptibility to
social engineering, phishing, and other cyber threats, making them
potential weak links in the organization’s defenses. &amp; <span
style="color: high">High</span><br />
<strong><span style="color: high">Outdated Windows Policy (Windows
7)</span></strong> &amp; Some workstations within the organization are
running Windows 7, an operating system that has reached its end-of-life.
These systems no longer receive security updates, making them highly
vulnerable to new exploits and malware. &amp; <span
style="color: high">High</span><br />

</div>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actionable recommendations are provided to mitigate the
identified risks and improve Ironclad Logistics’ cybersecurity
posture.</p>
<h2 id="critical-and-high-priority-recommendations">Critical and High
Priority Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immediate FTP Service Remediation
(<em>Critical</em>)</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Disable Anonymous FTP:</strong> Immediately configure the
<code>vsftpd</code> service to disallow anonymous logins.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Evaluate Necessity:</strong> Determine if FTP is
absolutely necessary. If not, disable the service entirely. FTP is an
insecure protocol that transmits credentials and data in plaintext.
Consider secure alternatives like SFTP or SCP.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade/Replace vsftpd:</strong> If FTP is critical,
upgrade to the latest stable and supported version of
<code>vsftpd</code> or replace it with a more modern and secure file
transfer solution.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Access
(<em>High</em>)</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Mandate MFA:</strong> Implement and enforce Multi-Factor
Authentication for all email accounts across the organization. This
significantly reduces the risk of email account compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>User Training:</strong> Provide clear instructions and
support to employees on how to enable and use MFA.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Security Awareness Training for New Employees
(<em>High</em>)</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Onboarding Training:</strong> Integrate mandatory
security awareness training into the onboarding process for all new
employees. This training should cover phishing, social engineering,
password best practices, and organizational security policies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Refresher:</strong> Ensure this initial training
is reinforced by the annual security awareness training for all
employees.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Address Outdated Windows Operating Systems
(<em>High</em>)</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade Windows 7 Systems:</strong> Plan and execute an
immediate upgrade path for all workstations running Windows 7 to a
supported operating system (e.g., Windows 10 or 11).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Isolate Legacy Systems:</strong> If immediate upgrades
are not feasible for critical operational reasons, isolate Windows 7
systems on a segmented network with strict access controls and enhanced
monitoring to minimize their exposure to threats.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hardware Refresh:</strong> Consider a hardware refresh
cycle for systems that cannot support newer Windows versions.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Ironclad Logistics faces significant cybersecurity challenges,
primarily stemming from a critically vulnerable FTP service and key
deficiencies in its security awareness and identity management
practices. Addressing the anonymous FTP vulnerability and outdated
<code>vsftpd</code> version should be the top priority due to the
immediate and severe risk of compromise. Simultaneously, implementing
MFA for email and comprehensive security awareness training for new
employees will significantly bolster the organization’s defenses against
common attack vectors. Proactive remediation of these issues will
substantially improve Ironclad Logistics’ overall security posture.</p>
