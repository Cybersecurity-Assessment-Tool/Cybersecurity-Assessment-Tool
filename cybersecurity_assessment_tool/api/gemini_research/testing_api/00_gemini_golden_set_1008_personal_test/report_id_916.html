<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This document presents a comprehensive cybersecurity assessment of
<strong>Stellar Pathways</strong>. The analysis synthesizes data from a
security questionnaire, a network scan of a specified target, and an
review of existing identified risks. The goal is to provide a clear
overview of the organization’s current security controls, identify
potential vulnerabilities, and offer strategic recommendations for
improvement.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on the specified target to identify open
ports and services.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Target:</strong> <code>192.168.1.100</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> The target host was identified as

<li><p><strong>Open Ports and Services:</strong> No open ports were
identified on the scanned target. The scanner reported all extra ports
as <code>closed</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note:</em> While the absence of open ports on this specific
target is a positive finding, this scan provides a limited view of the
entire network’s external or internal exposure.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and enhance the overall
cybersecurity posture of <strong>Stellar Pathways</strong>, the
following recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Mandatory New Employee Security Awareness
Training:</strong> Establish and enforce a comprehensive security
awareness training program for all new hires during their onboarding
process. This training should cover essential topics such as phishing,
social engineering, strong password practices, data handling, and
organizational security policies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Annual Security Awareness Training for All
Employees:</strong> Implement a mandatory annual security awareness
training program for all employees. This training should be updated
regularly to reflect current threat landscapes and reinforce best
practices, ensuring continuous education and vigilance against evolving
cyber threats. Consider integrating interactive modules and real-world
examples.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Regular Phishing Simulation Exercises:</strong>
Complement security awareness training with regular, simulated phishing
campaigns. These exercises can help employees identify and report
suspicious emails, reinforcing their training and providing valuable
metrics on the effectiveness of the awareness program.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Expand Network Scanning Scope:</strong> While the initial
scan of <code>192.168.1.100</code> yielded positive results (no open
ports), it is recommended to conduct comprehensive vulnerability scans
and penetration tests across the entire external-facing infrastructure
and critical internal systems. This broader assessment will provide a
more complete picture of the organization’s technical attack
surface.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Review and Update Security Policies Regularly:</strong>
Ensure that security policies, including the acceptable use policy, are
regularly reviewed and updated to remain current with technological
changes and evolving threats. Communicate these updates clearly to all
employees.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p><strong>Stellar Pathways</strong> demonstrates a commendable
commitment to multi-factor authentication across critical access points
and maintains an acceptable use policy. The targeted network scan
indicated a secure configuration for the scanned host concerning open
ports. However, the most significant identified vulnerabilities lie
within the human factor, specifically the absence of regular security
awareness training for both new and existing employees. Addressing these
training gaps is paramount to building a robust defense-in-depth
strategy and significantly reducing the organization’s overall risk
profile. Proactive implementation of the recommended actions will
strengthen the security posture against prevalent cyber threats.</p>
