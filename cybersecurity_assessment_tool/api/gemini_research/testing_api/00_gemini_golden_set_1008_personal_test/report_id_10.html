<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of <strong>Apex Legends
Group</strong> based on an organizational security questionnaire, a
network scan, and a review of reported existing risks. The organization
demonstrates good foundational controls, particularly in Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) implementation and the presence of an Acceptable
Use Policy (AUP). However, a significant gap was identified in employee
security awareness training. The network scan of did not reveal any open
ports or services, suggesting a secure external perimeter from the
scanned perspective. No pre-existing vulnerabilities were reported.
Immediate recommendations focus on establishing comprehensive security
awareness training programs to mitigate the identified human-factor
risks.</p>

<p>A network scan was performed.</p>

provided with a date.)</p></li>

<p>The scan did not identify any open ports or running services on the
target host. This indicates a well-hardened external perimeter, or that
the target was unreachable, or the scan data provided was empty. As no
services were identified, there are no immediate technical
vulnerabilities to report from this scan data.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To enhance the overall cybersecurity posture of <strong>Apex Legends
Group</strong>, the following recommendations are provided:</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="immediate-actions">Immediate Actions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and implement a mandatory security awareness training
program for all new hires during their onboarding process.</p></li>
<li><p>The training should cover essential topics such as phishing
identification, secure password practices, data handling best practices,
social engineering tactics, and incident reporting procedures.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Annual Security Awareness Training for All
Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mandate annual security awareness training for all employees to
reinforce security principles and educate them on emerging threats,
policy updates, and new attack vectors.</p></li>
<li><p>Utilize engaging and interactive formats (e.g., interactive
modules, simulated phishing exercises) to maximize retention and
effectiveness.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="continuous-improvement">Continuous
Improvement</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Regularly Review and Update Security Policies:</strong>
Ensure that the Acceptable Use Policy and any other security-related
policies are regularly reviewed and updated to reflect current best
practices, technological changes, and organizational
requirements.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Regular Vulnerability Scanning and Penetration
Testing:</strong> While the provided network scan was clear, regular
external and internal vulnerability scans, along with periodic
penetration tests, are crucial to proactively identify and address
potential technical weaknesses before they can be exploited.</p></li>
