<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of <strong>Paper Plane
Publishing</strong> based on an analysis of provided organizational
data, a network scan, and current risk information. While the network
scan on the specified internal target revealed no open ports, indicating
a baseline level of network hardening for that host, the organizational
data highlights critical gaps in fundamental security controls. Key
findings include the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
computer logins and sensitive data systems, as well as a lack of annual
security awareness training for all employees. Addressing these policy
and control weaknesses is paramount to significantly enhance the
organization’s overall security posture and reduce the likelihood of
successful cyberattacks.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An Nmap scan was performed on the target <code>192.168.1.100</code>.
The scan metadata is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>192.168.1.100</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> Up (online)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> <em>Not provided in scan
metadata.</em></p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="findings">Findings</h2>
<p>The Nmap scan revealed that the target host
<code>192.168.1.100</code> was online. However, no open ports were
identified during the scan, and all extra ports were reported as closed.
This indicates that, from the perspective of the network segment where
the scan was executed, this specific host does not expose any network
services directly.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> As the target IP address
<code>192.168.1.100</code> is a private IP, this scan likely represents
an internal network assessment. The absence of open ports is a positive
indicator for the host’s configuration within that internal segment, but
this scan does not provide insight into the organization’s external
network perimeter or the security posture of other internal systems.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of organizational controls and technical scan
results, the following risks have been identified:</p>

<th style="text-align: left;"><strong>Overview</strong></th>
<th style="text-align: left;"><strong>Severity</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Lack of MFA for Computer
Logins</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Without Multi-Factor Authentication for
computer logins, accounts are vulnerable to credential theft via
phishing, brute-force, or keyloggers. A compromised user account could
grant an attacker initial access to internal systems and data.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">High</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data
Systems</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Absence of MFA for systems containing
sensitive data significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access.
If an attacker gains access to a user’s primary credentials, they could
directly access critical data stores without an additional layer of
authentication. This poses a direct threat to data confidentiality and
integrity.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Critical</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Insufficient Annual Security
Awareness Training</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Without regular (at least annual) security
awareness training for all employees, the human element remains a
significant vulnerability. Employees may not be up-to-date on the latest
threats (e.g., phishing, social engineering) or best practices,
increasing the likelihood of successful attacks that bypass technical
controls.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">High</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>No Publicly Reported Pre-existing
Vulnerabilities</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">No pre-existing vulnerabilities were
provided in the input data for this assessment. While this is not a
finding of a vulnerability itself, it suggests a potential gap in
proactive vulnerability tracking or reporting, or simply that no prior
assessments of this nature have been shared.</td>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To significantly enhance the cybersecurity posture of Paper Plane
Publishing, the following recommendations are provided:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer
Logins:</strong> Deploy and enforce MFA for all employee computer
logins. This dramatically increases resistance to credential compromise
and unauthorized access to workstations and internal networks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive
Data Systems:</strong> Prioritize the implementation of MFA for all
systems that store, process, or transmit sensitive organizational or
client data. This is a critical control for protecting high-value assets
and ensuring data confidentiality.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Annual Security Awareness Training
Program:</strong> Develop and implement a mandatory annual security
awareness training program for all employees. This training should be
comprehensive, cover current threat landscapes (e.g., advanced phishing,
ransomware), organizational policies, and best practices for secure
behavior.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Regular and Comprehensive Vulnerability
Assessments:</strong> Perform regular internal and external
vulnerability scans and penetration tests across all critical systems
and network perimeters. This will help identify and remediate technical
vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by malicious
actors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Maintain Robust Patch Management:</strong> Ensure all
operating systems, applications, and network devices are kept up-to-date
with the latest security patches to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
Implement a clear patching schedule and verification process.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Review and Update Incident Response Plan:</strong> Ensure
an up-to-date and tested incident response plan is in place. Regular
drills and tabletop exercises will help the organization effectively
handle and recover from security incidents with minimal impact.</p></li>
