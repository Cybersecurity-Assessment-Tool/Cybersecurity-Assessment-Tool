<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive assessment of <strong>Midnight
Oil Studios</strong>’s cybersecurity posture, based on a security
questionnaire, a network scan, and a review of existing risks. The
analysis reveals a mixed security landscape. While the organization
demonstrates strengths in areas such as multi-factor authentication
(MFA) for sensitive data systems and computers, and has an acceptable
use policy, critical gaps persist. Specifically, the absence of MFA for
email access and a lack of dedicated security awareness training for new
employees present significant attack vectors. Furthermore, an open SSH
service was identified on a target system, necessitating further
investigation and hardening. This report details these findings and
provides actionable recommendations to enhance the overall security
posture.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="key-observations-from-questionnaire">Key
Observations from Questionnaire:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strengths:</strong> MFA is used for computer logins and
sensitive data systems, indicating good control over system and data
access. An acceptable use policy is in place, and annual security
awareness training is conducted for all employees.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gaps:</strong> A significant gap is the lack of MFA for
email access, which is a common and high-value target for attackers.
Furthermore, new employees do not receive initial security awareness
training, which can lead to early-stage vulnerabilities through social
engineering or unintentional errors.</p></li>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was conducted on the specified target. The scan date
was not explicitly provided in the input data.</p>

<li><p><strong>Target Scanned:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> Up</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Identified Open Ports and Services:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 22/tcp:</strong> State: Open (Service: SSH - Secure
Shell)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Note on Service Details:</strong> The provided scan data
did not include specific service versions, products, or additional
details for the identified open ports. This limits the ability to assess
specific software vulnerabilities for the SSH service.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="key-observations-from-technical-scan">Key
Observations from Technical Scan:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>An SSH (Secure Shell) service is running on the scanned host .
While SSH is a legitimate service for secure remote access and
management, it is a frequent target for attackers attempting brute-force
logins or exploiting software vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p>Without version information, it is not possible to determine if
the SSH daemon is running an outdated or vulnerable version known to
have exploits.</p></li>

scan, and existing vulnerability data to identify and categorize current
risks to Midnight Oil Studios.</p>

<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of MFA for Email Access</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Email accounts are primary targets for
phishing and compromise. Without MFA, a single compromised password can
grant an attacker access to sensitive communications, internal systems,
and potentially lead to further network penetration or business email
compromise (BEC) attacks.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;">Inadequate New Employee Security Awareness
Training</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">New employees are often unfamiliar with an
organization’s specific security policies and common threats. Lack of
initial training increases the risk of social engineering attacks,
phishing, and unintentional security breaches (e.g., mishandling
sensitive data) during their onboarding phase.</td>

<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Open SSH Service Without Version
Details</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">An open SSH port exposes the service to
potential brute-force attacks or exploitation of vulnerabilities in
outdated SSH daemon versions. Without specific version information, a
full vulnerability assessment is limited, and the system could be
running a publicly known vulnerable service.</td>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following recommendations are provided to mitigate the identified
risks and enhance Midnight Oil Studios’s overall cybersecurity
posture.</p>
<h2 id="implement-mfa-for-email-access">Implement MFA for Email
Access</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Enable and enforce multi-factor
authentication (MFA) for all organizational email accounts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Details:</strong> This is a critical step that
significantly reduces the risk of email account compromise, even if an
attacker obtains a user’s password. Consider using hardware tokens or
authenticator applications as preferred MFA methods. Communicate the
importance and benefits of MFA to all users during
implementation.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2
id="establish-comprehensive-new-employee-security-awareness-training">Establish
Comprehensive New Employee Security Awareness Training</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop and implement mandatory security
awareness training for all new hires. This training should be completed
before new employees gain access to company systems or sensitive
data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Details:</strong> This initial training should cover
essential security topics such as phishing identification, social
engineering tactics, strong password practices, acceptable use policy,
data handling guidelines, and incident reporting procedures. Tailor the
content to be relevant to the organization’s specific threat landscape
and policies.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="secure-ssh-service">Secure SSH Service</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Conduct a thorough review of the SSH
configuration on the host .</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Details:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Update SSH Daemon:</strong> Ensure the SSH server is
running the latest stable and patched version to mitigate known
vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Disable Password Authentication:</strong> Prioritize and
enforce key-based authentication, which is generally more secure than
passwords.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Disable Root Login:</strong> Configure SSH to prevent
direct root logins. Instead, users should log in with a non-root account
and use ‘sudo‘ for elevated privileges.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Rate Limiting/Intrusion Detection:</strong> Use
tools like ‘fail2ban‘ or similar intrusion prevention systems to block
IP addresses attempting brute-force attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Restrict Access:</strong> If feasible, limit SSH access
to specific trusted IP addresses or networks using firewall
rules.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Monitor Logs:</strong> Regularly review SSH access logs
for suspicious activity or failed login attempts.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="proactive-vulnerability-management">Proactive Vulnerability
Management</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Implement regular, scheduled
vulnerability scanning and, if appropriate, penetration testing across
the entire network infrastructure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Details:</strong> This proactive approach will help
identify and address potential weaknesses, including outdated software
versions, misconfigurations, and new vulnerabilities, before they can be
exploited by malicious actors. Ensure that scans include detailed
version detection for all services, providing actionable data for
remediation.</p></li>
