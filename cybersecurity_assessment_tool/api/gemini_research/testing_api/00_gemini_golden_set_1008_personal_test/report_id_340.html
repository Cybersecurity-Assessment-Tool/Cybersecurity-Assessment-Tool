<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">1. Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of <strong>Harbor Light
Foundation</strong> based on a review of organizational data, a targeted
network scan, and an assessment of current risks. The analysis reveals
several critical gaps in security controls, particularly concerning
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and ongoing security awareness
training. While the technical scan of the specified internal host did
not identify any open ports or services, indicating a potentially
well-secured host from a network perspective, the overall security
posture is weakened by the identified control deficiencies. No
pre-existing vulnerabilities were reported. Immediate attention to the
recommended remediation actions is advised to enhance the organization’s
resilience against cyber threats.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">4. Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>A targeted network scan was performed on the internal host
<code>192.168.1.100</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Target:</strong> <code>192.168.1.100</code>
(Internal Network)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> N/A (Not provided in scan
metadata)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Used:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> Up</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The scan reported that no open ports were identified on the target
<code>192.168.1.100</code>. All common ports were reported as
closed.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> While the absence of open ports is
generally a positive finding from a security perspective for a single
host, especially if it’s meant to be locked down, it’s important to
consider the context. For an internal IP, this could indicate:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The host is very well hardened and not running any network
services on common ports.</p></li>
<li><p>A firewall or host-based intrusion prevention system is blocking
the scanner from enumerating ports.</p></li>
<li><p>The scan’s scope was limited, and other internal hosts or
different port ranges might yield different results.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Without further context or a broader scan, it’s difficult to draw
definitive conclusions about the entire internal network based solely on
this single host scan. However, for this specific host, there were no
directly exploitable services identified via the network scan.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment">5. Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes the findings from the security control
review and technical analysis, categorizing identified risks.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="identified-high-level-risks-from-questionnaire">5.1. Identified
High-Level Risks (from Questionnaire)</h2>
<p>Based on the security control review, the following critical risks
were identified:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Email Access (Critical):</strong> Without
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, accounts are highly
susceptible to credential stuffing, phishing, and brute-force attacks. A
compromised email account can serve as a pivot point for broader network
intrusion, data exfiltration, and business email compromise (BEC)
scams.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Computer Login (Critical):</strong>
Similar to email, not requiring MFA for logging into computers
significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials
are stolen or guessed. This can lead to direct access to internal
systems, data, and critical infrastructure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inadequate Annual Security Awareness Training
(High):</strong> While training for new employees is provided, the
absence of regular, annual security awareness training for all employees
leaves the organization vulnerable to evolving social engineering
tactics, phishing attacks, and insider threats. Employees are the first
line of defense, and their knowledge needs to be continuously
updated.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="technical-vulnerabilities">5.2. Technical
Vulnerabilities</h2>
<p>The network scan on <code>192.168.1.100</code> did not identify any
open ports or running services, therefore no technical vulnerabilities
were directly discovered on this specific host through this scan.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="pre-existing-vulnerabilities">5.3.
Pre-Existing Vulnerabilities</h2>
<p>The provided data indicates no pre-existing vulnerabilities
(<code>vulnerabilities</code> array was empty) reported by the
organization.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">6. Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the findings, the following recommendations are provided to
enhance the cybersecurity posture of <strong>Harbor Light
Foundation</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email
Access:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediately deploy and enforce MFA for
all employee email accounts. This should be a mandatory requirement for
accessing email services.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Significantly reduces the risk of email
account compromise, even if passwords are stolen.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer
Login:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Implement MFA for logging into all
company computers and workstations, especially those accessing sensitive
data or critical systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Adds a crucial layer of security,
preventing unauthorized access to endpoints and the internal
network.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Annual Security Awareness Training for All
Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop and implement a mandatory annual
security awareness training program for all employees, regardless of
tenure. This training should cover current threats such as phishing,
social engineering, ransomware, and proper data handling.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Empowers employees to recognize and
report threats, fostering a security-conscious culture and reducing the
likelihood of human-factor incidents.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Consider Broader Internal Network Scanning
Scope:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> While the single host scan showed no
open ports, consider expanding internal network scans to cover a wider
range of IP addresses and services within the internal network to gain a
more comprehensive understanding of the attack surface.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Provides a clearer picture of potential
vulnerabilities on other internal systems and ensures no critical
services are inadvertently exposed.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">7. Conclusion</h1>
<p><strong>Harbor Light Foundation</strong> demonstrates a foundational
commitment to security by having an acceptable use policy and initial
security awareness training. However, the absence of MFA for email and
computer logins, coupled with the lack of ongoing security awareness
training, represents significant vulnerabilities. Addressing these
critical control gaps should be the organization’s highest priority. By
implementing the recommended actions, Harbor Light Foundation can
substantially strengthen its defenses against common cyber threats and
enhance its overall cybersecurity posture.</p>
