<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of Clear Path based on
a recent network scan, a security questionnaire, and an existing risk
register. The analysis reveals several critical security gaps, primarily
concerning the widespread lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
across key systems (email, computer logins, sensitive data access) and
insufficient annual security awareness training. While the recent
network scan found no open ports on the target <code>192.168.0.5</code>,
a pre-existing risk of an "Unencrypted Web Server" (Port 80 open)
indicates a potential inconsistency or an external-facing vulnerability
not covered by the internal scan. Addressing these fundamental control
weaknesses is paramount to significantly enhance the organization’s
security resilience against modern cyber threats.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed targeting <code>192.168.0.5</code>. The
scan metadata indicates:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target:</strong> <code>192.168.0.5</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> (Not explicitly provided in
input)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The scan revealed that no open ports were identified on the target
host. Specifically, Port 80, which is often associated with web
services, was found to be <strong>closed</strong>. This is a positive
finding for the scanned host in isolation, indicating no immediately
exposed services on this particular internal IP.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes risks identified from pre-existing records,
questionnaire gaps, and recent technical scans.</p>
<h2 id="pre-existing-vulnerabilities">Pre-existing Vulnerabilities</h2>
<p>The organization’s existing risk register includes the following
vulnerability:</p>

</table>
</div>
<p><em>Note:</em> There is a discrepancy between the recent internal
network scan (Port 80 closed on <code>192.168.0.5</code>) and this
pre-existing risk (Port 80 open on an unspecified host). This warrants
immediate investigation to confirm the current state and applicability
of this risk, particularly concerning any external-facing systems that
might present this vulnerability.</p>
<h2
id="identified-critical-gaps-from-security-controls-review">Identified
Critical Gaps from Security Controls Review</h2>
<p>The questionnaire responses highlighted several critical gaps in
security controls, each posing a significant risk:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
Email:</strong> Exposes email accounts to single-factor credential
compromise, a primary vector for phishing and business email compromise
(BEC) attacks, leading to potential data theft, financial fraud, or
further system compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer
Logins:</strong> Increases the risk of unauthorized access to internal
systems if user credentials are stolen or guessed, potentially leading
to lateral movement within the network.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive
Data Systems:</strong> Critical data systems are vulnerable to
unauthorized access with only a single factor, significantly increasing
the likelihood and impact of data breaches.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Annual Security Awareness Training for All
Employees:</strong> Without regular, comprehensive training, employees
are more susceptible to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing,
vishing), increasing the likelihood of successful breaches and
compromising the human element of security.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="new-technical-findings">New Technical Findings</h2>
<p>The recent network scan did not identify any new open ports or
immediate technical vulnerabilities on the scanned target
<code>192.168.0.5</code>. This indicates a relatively secure internal
endpoint configuration, at least concerning its network exposure.
However, this finding should be considered in conjunction with the
pre-existing risks and the broader network environment.</p>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and improve the overall cybersecurity
posture, the following actionable recommendations are provided:</p>
<h2 id="immediate-actions">Immediate Actions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Across
Critical Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Deploy MFA for all email accounts within the
<code>ClearPath.org</code> domain.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement MFA for all computer logins across the organization’s
network.</p></li>
<li><p>Enforce MFA for access to all sensitive data systems and critical
business applications.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Verify "Unencrypted Web Server" Risk:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Conduct an immediate audit of all public-facing web servers and
services associated with <code>ClearPath.org</code> or
<code>92.171.198.163</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Confirm whether Port 80 is currently open on any external systems
without HTTPS redirection.</p></li>
<li><p>If an unencrypted web server is found, immediately implement
HTTPS with valid SSL/TLS certificates and configure redirects from HTTP
to HTTPS. If no such server exists, update the organization’s risk
register accordingly to reflect the current state.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="strategic-recommendations">Strategic Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Establish Comprehensive Annual Security Awareness
Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and implement a mandatory annual security awareness
training program for all employees.</p></li>
<li><p>Training should cover essential cybersecurity topics such as
phishing, social engineering, strong password practices, data handling,
and incident reporting procedures.</p></li>
<li><p>Supplement annual training with regular security updates,
newsletters, and simulated phishing exercises to reinforce learning and
maintain vigilance.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Regular Vulnerability Scanning and Penetration
Testing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Establish a schedule for regular internal and external
vulnerability scanning to proactively identify and address technical
weaknesses before they can be exploited.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider engaging in periodic penetration testing to simulate
real-world attacks and uncover complex vulnerabilities.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Continuous Risk Register Management:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Maintain a dynamic and regularly reviewed risk register to track
identified vulnerabilities, assess their impact and likelihood, and
monitor the progress of mitigation efforts.</p></li>
<li><p>Prioritize risks based on their severity and organizational
impact, allocating resources effectively to address the most critical
threats.</p></li>
