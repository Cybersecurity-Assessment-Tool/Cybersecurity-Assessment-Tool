<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for Aetheric Systems, integrating data from an organizational security
questionnaire, a network scan, and pre-existing risk documentation. The
assessment reveals a mixed security landscape. While some foundational
controls are present, critical vulnerabilities and significant control
gaps were identified, particularly concerning Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) implementation and comprehensive security awareness
training.</p>
<p>A key observation is the discrepancy between a pre-existing risk
identifying an "Unencrypted Web Server" on Port 80 and the current
network scan results showing Port 80 as <strong>closed</strong>. This
suggests a potential mitigation or change in infrastructure, but
requires verification to ensure no unencrypted services are
inadvertently exposed elsewhere or in different configurations.
Addressing the identified MFA gaps and bolstering security training are
paramount to significantly enhancing the organization’s overall security
resilience.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was conducted on the internal target
<code>192.168.0.5</code>. The scan aimed to identify active hosts and
their exposed services.</p>

<h2 id="host-findings">Host Findings</h2>
<p>The host was found to be <strong>up</strong>. However, the scan
results indicate that <strong>no open ports were identified</strong> on
this target. Specifically, port 80 was found to be
<strong>closed</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> The provided scan data was limited and did not include
details on specific service names, product versions, or further
vulnerability information beyond port states. This limits the depth of
technical vulnerability analysis from the scan alone.</p>

current threat landscapes.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="medium-priority-actions">Medium Priority Actions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Verify Web Server Configuration and Policy (Port
80):</strong> Investigate the discrepancy between the "Unencrypted Web
Server" pre-existing risk and the current scan results showing Port 80
as closed.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Confirm if Port 80 was intentionally closed on
<code>192.168.0.5</code> and if this change has been
documented.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure no other internal or external facing servers are exposing
unencrypted HTTP services without a legitimate business need or
appropriate compensating controls.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement a policy to enforce HTTPS for all web
services.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="general-security-best-practices">General Security Best
Practices</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Regular Vulnerability Assessments:</strong>
Implement a schedule for regular, authenticated network and application
vulnerability scans to proactively identify and address
weaknesses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Maintain Asset Inventory:</strong> Keep an up-to-date
inventory of all network assets, including IP addresses, services, and
software versions, to facilitate efficient security management.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Incident Response Plan:</strong> Develop, document, and
regularly test an incident response plan to ensure the organization can
effectively detect, respond to, and recover from security
incidents.</p></li>
