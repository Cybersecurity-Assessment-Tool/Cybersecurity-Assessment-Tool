<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>This assessment provides an external and internal perspective on the
cybersecurity posture of Cinder &amp; Ash. The analysis is derived from
three main data sources:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON</strong>: External network scan
results.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Input_2_Org_Data_JSON</strong>: Self-reported
organizational security controls and information.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON</strong>: A list of previously
identified or reported vulnerabilities.</p></li>

<p>A network scan was performed against the target
<code>[Target IP]</code>. The provided scan results were empty,
indicating that no open ports or services were identified on the
specified target during the scan period.</p>
<p><em>Note: While no open ports were identified in this specific scan,
this does not guarantee complete security. Comprehensive security
requires regular, in-depth vulnerability assessments, penetration
testing, and continuous monitoring of both external and internal

vulnerability analysis from the provided scan data is not
possible.</em></p>

<p>Based on the analysis of the organizational data and the network

<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of MFA for Computer Logins</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Without Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
for computer logins, an attacker who obtains a user’s credentials (e.g.,
via phishing) can easily gain unauthorized access to internal systems,
leading to data breaches, ransomware, or system compromise. This

<td style="text-align: left;">A lack of a formal AUP means employees may
not be aware of expected behavior regarding company IT resources, data

misuse of company assets, data exfiltration, or the introduction of
malware due to uncontrolled internet access.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;">No Security Awareness Training for New
Employees</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">New employees are often prime targets for
social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) as they may be less familiar
with company security protocols and common threats. Without initial
training, they represent a significant human vulnerability from day one,
potentially exposing the organization to various attacks.</td>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and enhance the overall cybersecurity
posture of Cinder &amp; Ash, the following recommendations are
provided:</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="immediate-actions">Immediate Actions</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Logins:</strong> Mandate
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins across the
organization. This is a critical control that significantly reduces the
risk of unauthorized access even if primary credentials are stolen.
Prioritize implementation on all endpoints and servers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a clear, comprehensive Acceptable Use Policy that
outlines acceptable use of company IT resources, data, and internet
access. Ensure all employees review, understand, and formally
acknowledge the AUP upon hire and annually thereafter. The AUP should
cover topics such as data handling, internet usage, software
installation, and personal device usage.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mandate Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong> Implement mandatory security awareness training for
all new hires during their onboarding process. This training should
cover common threats (e.g., phishing, social engineering, malware),
secure data handling best practices, password hygiene, and the
organization’s specific security policies and procedures. This initial
training is crucial to establish a strong security culture from day
one.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="ongoing-best-practices">Ongoing Best
Practices</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Regular Vulnerability Assessments and Penetration
Testing:</strong> Schedule regular internal and external vulnerability
assessments and penetration tests (at least annually) to proactively
identify and remediate technical weaknesses in systems and applications.
This goes beyond basic port scanning and includes deeper analysis of
configurations and known vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Maintain an Up-to-Date Asset Inventory:</strong> Ensure a
comprehensive and up-to-date inventory of all IT assets (hardware,
software, cloud services) to facilitate effective security management
and vulnerability tracking.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Incident Response Plan Review:</strong> Regularly review
and update the organization’s incident response plan to ensure it is
current and effective in addressing potential security incidents.
Conduct tabletop exercises to test the plan’s efficacy.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These recommendations, once implemented, will significantly
strengthen Cinder &amp; Ash’s defense against common cyber threats and
improve its overall resilience.</p>
