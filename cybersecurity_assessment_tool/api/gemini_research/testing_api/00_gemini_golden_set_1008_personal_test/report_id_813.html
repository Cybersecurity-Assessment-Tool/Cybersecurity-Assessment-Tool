<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of Symmetry
Architecture based on a review of organizational data, existing risk
assessments, and a recent network scan. While strong controls are noted
for Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), critical gaps were identified in
foundational security awareness training and policy enforcement,
specifically regarding an Employee Acceptable Use Policy. A particularly
concerning finding from the technical scan is an open Port 8080 on
<code>10.5.5.5</code> explicitly identifying its service as a "TOP
SECRET DB," which directly contradicts an internal assessment (Input 3)
categorizing this port as "secure" and a "false positive" with zero
severity. This discrepancy highlights a significant vulnerability
management and risk assessment gap. Immediate attention is required to
address these policy deficiencies and thoroughly investigate the exposed
port to prevent potential data breaches and re-evaluate risk assessment
processes.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was conducted on the internal target
<code>10.5.5.5</code>. The scan revealed an open port with critical
information disclosure.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Target:</strong> <code>10.5.5.5</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Date of Scan Data:</strong> Not explicitly provided in
input.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports and Services:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 8080/tcp:</strong> Open</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Service/Script Output:</strong>
<code>http-title: TOP SECRET DB</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Observations:</strong> The service running on port 8080
explicitly advertises itself as a "TOP SECRET DB". This is a highly
significant finding, indicating either an intentionally exposed database
or a severe misconfiguration. This level of information disclosure is
deeply concerning, particularly if this internal IP is reachable from a
broader network segment or if there are any misconfigurations that could
expose it to the internet. The very title suggests a high likelihood of
sensitive information being present and potentially exposed.</p></li>

<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Lack of Employee Acceptable Use
Policy (AUP)</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Without a formal AUP, employees may lack
clear guidelines regarding appropriate use of company assets, data, and
internet resources. This increases the risk of inadvertent security
breaches, non-compliance with regulations, and potential insider threats
due to unclear boundaries.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Inadequate Security Awareness
Training for New Hires</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">New employees, unfamiliar with
organizational security protocols and common threat vectors, are highly
susceptible to social engineering attacks such as phishing. This lack of
initial training significantly increases the risk of successful external
attacks exploiting human vulnerabilities.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>No Annual Security Awareness
Training for All Employees</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Cyber threats are constantly evolving.
Without regular, mandatory security awareness training, employees’
knowledge of current threats and best practices becomes outdated,
weakening the organization’s human firewall and increasing
susceptibility to sophisticated attacks.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Exposed "TOP SECRET DB" on Port
8080</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">An open port 8080 on <code>10.5.5.5</code>
is actively serving content that identifies itself as a "TOP SECRET DB".
This represents an immediate and critical risk of sensitive information
disclosure, unauthorized access, and potential data exfiltration. The
explicit naming implies the presence of highly confidential data. This
finding directly contradicts the existing organizational assessment for
this port.</td>

<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Discrepancy in Port 8080 Risk
Assessment</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The organization’s internal risk register
(<em>Input_3</em>) classifies "Port 8080" as "confirmed secure and false
positive" with a CVSS score of 0.0, advising it be ignored. This
directly conflicts with the technical scan’s finding of an active
service identifying as "TOP SECRET DB". This severe inconsistency
indicates a critical flaw in the organization’s vulnerability
management, risk assessment methodology, or asset inventory processes,
potentially masking active and critical exposures.</td>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actionable recommendations are provided to mitigate the
identified risks and significantly improve Symmetry Architecture’s
overall cybersecurity posture.</p>
<h2 id="policy-and-training-enhancements">Policy and Training
Enhancements</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement a Comprehensive Employee Acceptable
Use Policy (AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create a clear, concise, and comprehensive AUP that explicitly
outlines acceptable use of all company IT assets, networks, and
data.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure the AUP covers internet usage, email, software
installation, data handling, password policies, and procedures for
reporting suspicious activities.</p></li>
<li><p>Mandate signed acknowledgment of the AUP from all employees,
ensuring they understand their responsibilities.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Mandatory New Employee Security Awareness
Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement a mandatory security awareness training program for all
new hires as part of their onboarding process.</p></li>
<li><p>Training should cover foundational security topics such as
phishing identification, malware prevention, strong password practices,
data classification, physical security, and incident reporting.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Annual Security Awareness Training for All
Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Conduct mandatory, recurrent security awareness training for all
employees at least once per year.</p></li>
<li><p>Update training content regularly to reflect the latest threat
landscapes, evolving attack techniques, and organizational policy
changes.</p></li>
<li><p>Utilize engaging and interactive formats (e.g., workshops,
simulated phishing campaigns) to reinforce learning and measure
effectiveness.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="technical-and-process-improvements">Technical and Process
Improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Investigation and Remediation of Port 8080 on
<code>10.5.5.5</code>:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Urgent Action:</strong> Immediately isolate and
investigate the service running on port 8080 on
<code>10.5.5.5</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Determine Purpose and Sensitivity:</strong> Confirm the
exact nature of the "TOP SECRET DB," the type of data it holds, and its
intended function.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Access Control Review:</strong> If this service is
intended to be exposed, ensure robust authentication, authorization, and
encryption are in place. Strictly limit network access to only necessary
internal hosts. If it’s not intended to be exposed, block access
immediately.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Network Segmentation:</strong> Ensure this system is
properly segmented and isolated from general user networks and external
access points.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Vulnerability Scan &amp; Penetration Test:</strong>
Conduct a focused vulnerability scan and penetration test specifically
targeting this service to identify potential exploit paths.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Review and Update Risk Assessment and Vulnerability
Management Processes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Re-evaluate Port 8080 Risk:</strong> Conduct an urgent
and thorough re-assessment of the "Port 8080 Secured" finding from the
existing risk register. Investigate why it was previously considered
secure and a false positive despite the current scan revealing a service
identifying as "TOP SECRET DB".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Process Improvement:</strong> Review and update the
organization’s procedures for identifying, assessing, and documenting
risks and vulnerabilities. Ensure that external scan results are
regularly correlated with internal assessments and that discrepancies
trigger immediate investigations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Asset Inventory Accuracy:</strong> Ensure that the asset
inventory is regularly updated and accurately reflects network services,
their configurations, and their exposure levels.</p></li>
