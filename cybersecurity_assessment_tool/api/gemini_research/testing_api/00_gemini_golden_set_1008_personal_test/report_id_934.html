<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>This report provides a cybersecurity posture assessment for
<strong>Ember Glow Hospitality</strong>, based on the provided network
scan data, organizational security questionnaire responses, and a review
of existing risks.</p>
<p>Overall, <strong>Ember Glow Hospitality</strong> demonstrates a
commendable commitment to multi-factor authentication across various
access points and has an acceptable use policy in place. These are
strong foundational controls. However, a significant gap identified is
the complete absence of formal security awareness training programs for
both new and existing employees. This represents a critical
vulnerability that could lead to successful social engineering attacks,
phishing, or other human-factor exploits.</p>
<p>The provided network scan data was empty, meaning no open ports or
services were identified for the target [Target IP]. While this could
indicate a secure external posture, it more likely points to an
incomplete scan or unreachable target, and thus cannot be fully relied
upon for a comprehensive technical assessment. No pre-existing
vulnerabilities were reported.</p>

<p>The provided network scan data did not include any open ports or
services. This could indicate that the target was unreachable, no
services were found to be listening, or the scan data was empty. Regular
and comprehensive network scans are critical for maintaining visibility
into the attack surface.</p>

<td style="text-align: left;">New employees are often prime targets for
social engineering attacks due to unfamiliarity with organizational
security policies and common threats. Without proper training, they pose
a significant risk to the organization.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of Annual Employee Security Awareness
Training</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Without regular security awareness
training, employees’ knowledge of best practices diminishes over time,
and they remain unaware of evolving threat landscapes (e.g., new
phishing tactics, ransomware variants). This increases the likelihood of
human-error induced security incidents.</td>
