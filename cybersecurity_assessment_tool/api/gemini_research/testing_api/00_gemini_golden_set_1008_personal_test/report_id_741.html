<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This document presents the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment for <strong>True Grit</strong>. The assessment involved
analyzing network scan results, evaluating organizational security
practices based on a questionnaire, and correlating these findings with
existing risk information. The objective is to identify vulnerabilities,
assess risks, and provide actionable recommendations to enhance the
organization’s security posture.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-security-controls">Analysis of Security
Controls</h2>
<p><strong>True Grit</strong> demonstrates good practices in requiring
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and sensitive data
systems, and maintains regular security awareness training. However,
critical gaps exist: the absence of MFA for email access significantly
increases the risk of account compromise, phishing, and subsequent
lateral movement within the network. Furthermore, the lack of an
Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) creates a void in formal guidelines
for employee behavior, potentially leading to insecure practices and
legal liabilities.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was conducted on the internal target
<code>10.5.5.5</code>. The scan metadata did not include a specific
date. The following critical finding was identified:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Port:</strong> <code>8080</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Service Detail:</strong> The service running on port 8080
reported “TOP SECRET DB” via the <code>http-title</code>
script.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The exposure of a service explicitly identifying itself as a "TOP
SECRET DB" on an open port is a severe security concern, indicating
potential unauthorized access to highly sensitive information.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment-and-correlation">Risk Assessment and
Correlation</h1>
<p>This section correlates findings from the security control review and
technical scans with existing risk information to provide a holistic
view of <strong>True Grit</strong>’s risk posture.</p>

states "Port 8080 is confirmed secure and false positive" with a
severity of 0.0. This directly contradicts the technical scan finding of
an exposed "TOP SECRET DB" on the same port. This discrepancy indicates
a critical failure in internal risk assessment, vulnerability
management, or asset inventory processes.</td>

</div>
<p>The most pressing issue is the exposure of a service identified as
"TOP SECRET DB" on port <code>8080</code> of . This is profoundly
concerning and is compounded by a severe discrepancy with the
organization’s own risk register, which classifies this port as secure
and a false positive. This contradiction suggests either outdated risk
information, an incomplete or inaccurate asset inventory, or a breakdown
in the vulnerability management process itself.</p>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and strengthen the cybersecurity
posture of <strong>True Grit</strong>, the following recommendations are
provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Access:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Mandate and implement Multi-Factor
Authentication for all email accounts across the organization.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Significantly reduces the risk of credential
theft and unauthorized access to email, a primary vector for
cyberattacks.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Draft, approve, and implement a comprehensive
AUP that clearly outlines acceptable and unacceptable use of
organizational IT resources. Ensure all employees are trained on and
acknowledge the policy.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Establishes clear expectations for employee
conduct, reduces human error-related security incidents, and strengthens
legal standing in case of misuse.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Urgent Investigation and Remediation of Exposed Sensitive
Database on Port 8080:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Immediately investigate the service running on .
Determine the exact nature of the "TOP SECRET DB," its contents, and the
level of sensitivity. Apply immediate access controls such as firewall
rules to restrict access to only authorized internal systems or
personnel. If the database is not intended for network exposure, it
should be secured or shut down.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Prevents unauthorized access, data
exfiltration, and potential compromise of critical organizational
data.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Reconcile Risk Register Discrepancies and Enhance
Vulnerability Management:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Conduct a thorough review of the organization’s
risk register, specifically focusing on discrepancies between documented
risks and actual technical findings. Implement a robust vulnerability
management process that includes regular, authenticated scans, and a
formal procedure for updating the risk register based on new technical
data. Investigate the root cause of the Port 8080 discrepancy.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Ensures the risk register accurately reflects
the current security posture, improves the effectiveness of risk
management, and prevents critical vulnerabilities from being
overlooked.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Regular Security Posture Reviews:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Establish a schedule for periodic comprehensive
security posture reviews, including vulnerability assessments,
penetration testing, and policy audits, to proactively identify and
address emerging risks. <em>Benefit:</em> Maintains an up-to-date
understanding of the security landscape and ensures continuous
improvement of security controls.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p><strong>True Grit</strong> faces several significant cybersecurity
challenges, primarily stemming from critical control gaps (MFA for
email, AUP) and a severe technical vulnerability involving a potentially
exposed sensitive database. The contradiction between technical scan
results and the internal risk register for port <code>8080</code> is
particularly concerning, indicating a need for urgent review of both
technical controls and internal risk management processes. Addressing
these findings through the recommended actions will substantially
enhance <strong>True Grit</strong>’s overall security posture and
resilience against cyber threats.</p>
