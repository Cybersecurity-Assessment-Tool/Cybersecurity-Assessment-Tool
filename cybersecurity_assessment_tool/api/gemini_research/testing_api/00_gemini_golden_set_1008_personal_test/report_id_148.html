<h2 id="analysis-of-questionnaire-responses">Analysis of Questionnaire
Responses</h2>
<p>The questionnaire highlights several critical areas for
improvement:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA for Email Access:</strong> The lack of Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for email access is a significant vulnerability.
Email is a primary vector for phishing and account compromise, and
without MFA, a stolen password can grant attackers full access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> The absence of an
AUP leaves employees without clear guidelines on the appropriate use of
organizational IT resources. This can lead to increased risks from
unintentional misuse or malicious activities, as expectations are not
formally set.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Security Awareness Training for New Employees:</strong>
Failing to provide security awareness training to new employees from the
outset means that new hires may unknowingly introduce risks or fall
victim to social engineering attacks during their critical onboarding
period.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed to identify open ports and services on a
specified target.</p>
<h2 id="scan-details">Scan Details</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Used:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not specified in provided
metadata.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="findings">Findings</h2>
<p>The Nmap scan against indicated that <strong>no open ports were
detected</strong>. All extra ports were reported as closed.
<strong>Interpretation:</strong> From the perspective of this specific
scan on , the absence of open ports is a positive security finding,
suggesting a well-hardened perimeter or an inactive host within the
scanned scope. However, this finding should be considered within the
full context of the organization’s network architecture, as other hosts
or segments may have different postures.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the combined analysis of the questionnaire and technical
scan, the following risks have been identified. No pre-existing
vulnerabilities were provided in the input data.</p>

theft, and further network intrusion.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>No Security Awareness Training for
New Hires</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">New employees, especially during the
onboarding phase, are prime targets for social engineering attacks
(e.g., phishing). Without initial security training, they may lack the
awareness to identify and report threats, increasing the human attack
surface.</td>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and enhance the overall
cybersecurity posture, the following recommendations are provided:</p>
<h2 id="immediate-actions-high-priority">Immediate Actions (High
Priority)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Access:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediately enable and enforce
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all organizational email
accounts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Significantly reduces the risk of email
account compromise, even if passwords are stolen, by requiring a second
verification factor.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement New Employee Security Awareness
Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Create a mandatory security awareness
training program for all new employees to be completed during
onboarding.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Equips new hires with essential
knowledge to recognize and respond to common cyber threats (e.g.,
phishing, malware) from day one, reducing the likelihood of human error
leading to breaches.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="mid-term-actions-medium-priority">Mid-Term Actions (Medium
Priority)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Draft, approve, and disseminate a
comprehensive AUP that clearly outlines expectations for employee
conduct regarding IT resource usage, data handling, and internet
browsing. Obtain signed acknowledgments from all employees.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Provides clear guidelines, reduces
misuse of company resources, enhances data protection, and establishes a
foundation for disciplinary action in case of policy
violations.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="ongoing-actions">Ongoing Actions</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Maintain Annual Security Awareness Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Continue with the current practice of
providing annual security awareness training for all employees, ensuring
content is updated regularly to reflect current threat
landscapes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Reinforces security best practices,
keeps employees informed about evolving threats, and fosters a strong
security culture.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Network Scanning and Vulnerability
Management:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Periodically perform internal and
external network scans and vulnerability assessments across the entire
IT infrastructure (not just single targets) to identify and remediate
potential weaknesses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Proactively identifies outdated
software, misconfigurations, and other technical vulnerabilities before
they can be exploited by attackers.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The assessment reveals a mixed security posture. While the network
scan of the specific target showed no immediate external
vulnerabilities, the organizational questionnaire identified significant
gaps in fundamental security controls related to multi-factor
authentication for email, acceptable use policies, and new employee
security training. Addressing these policy and human-factor related
risks should be the immediate priority for Deep Root Ecology to
significantly enhance its overall cybersecurity resilience.</p>
