<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of <strong>Crestview
Analytics</strong>, based on an analysis of provided organizational
data, security questionnaire responses, and a limited network scan. Key
findings indicate critical gaps in multi-factor authentication (MFA) for
computer logins and the absence of a formal employee acceptable use
policy (AUP). While a basic network scan revealed an open HTTP port,
further details are required for a comprehensive technical vulnerability
assessment. A pre-existing ’risk’ identified has a CVSS score of 0.0,
indicating it is not a practical security vulnerability. Recommendations
focus on addressing these foundational policy and control weaknesses to
enhance the overall security posture.</p>

<h2 id="questionnaire-analysis-summary">Questionnaire Analysis
Summary</h2>
<p>The analysis reveals the following critical gaps in security
controls:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins:</strong> The absence of
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins significantly
increases the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised
credentials. This is a critical security vulnerability that makes
systems highly susceptible to password-based attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong>
Without a formal AUP, employees may be unaware of their responsibilities
regarding the proper and secure use of company IT resources. This can
lead to potential misuse, accidental data exposure, or compliance
violations, creating a significant internal risk factor.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A limited network scan was performed based on the provided data. The
scan targeted an internal IP address and identified active services.</p>

<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="host-status-and-open-ports">Host Status and Open Ports</h2>
<p>The target host was found to be <strong>up</strong>. The following
open ports were identified:</p>

<td style="text-align: left;">Open</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2 id="technical-analysis-summary">Technical Analysis Summary</h2>
<p>The scan revealed an open HTTP (port 80) service on the target host .
Without detailed version information, specific service banners, or the
context of its usage, it is difficult to ascertain immediate
vulnerabilities. However, an open HTTP port typically hosts web
services, which are frequent targets for various attacks if not properly
secured, regularly patched, and securely configured. This finding
warrants further investigation to understand its purpose, associated
risks, and current security posture.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the assessment, the following actionable recommendations are
provided to enhance Crestview Analytics’ cybersecurity posture and
mitigate identified risks:</p>
<h2 id="immediate-actions-high-priority">Immediate Actions (High
Priority)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Logins:</strong> Immediately
enforce Multi-Factor Authentication for all computer logins across the
organization. This should apply to all user accounts accessing internal
systems, privileged accounts, and remote access solutions. This is the
single most effective control against credential theft.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a comprehensive AUP that clearly outlines
employee responsibilities regarding the secure and ethical use of
company IT assets, data handling, internet usage, and communication.
Ensure all employees are thoroughly trained on this policy upon
onboarding and annually thereafter, with documented
acknowledgment.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="further-investigations-and-long-term-fixes">Further
Investigations and Long-Term Fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Investigate Open Port 80 on :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Determine the exact purpose and service running on port
80.</p></li>
<li><p>If it is a web server, perform a detailed web application
security assessment and ensure it is running the latest stable and
patched version.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement strong security configurations, including HTTPS
enforcement, proper authentication, and least privilege access.</p></li>
<li><p>If the service is not essential or authorized, close the port to
reduce the attack surface.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Comprehensive Vulnerability Scanning:</strong> Conduct
more detailed and authenticated vulnerability scans, including service
version detection, on all internal and external assets. This will help
identify specific software vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and
outdated components.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Security Awareness Training
Reinforcement:</strong> While training is conducted, ensure that the
newly implemented AUP and MFA policies are thoroughly integrated into
all future security awareness training sessions. Regularly test
employees’ understanding and adherence through simulated phishing
campaigns and policy quizzes.</p></li>
