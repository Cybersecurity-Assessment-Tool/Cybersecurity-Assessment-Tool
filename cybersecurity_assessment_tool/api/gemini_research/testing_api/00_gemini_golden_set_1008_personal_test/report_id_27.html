<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report presents a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for <strong>Granite Shield</strong>, synthesizing data from a recent
network scan, a security controls questionnaire, and existing risk
documentation. The analysis highlights several critical vulnerabilities
and security gaps that require immediate attention. Key findings include
the use of an End-of-Life (EOL) MySQL database version, direct network
exposure of the MySQL service, a significant lack of Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for sensitive data systems, and inadequate security
awareness training for new employees. Addressing these identified risks
is crucial for strengthening <strong>Granite Shield</strong>’s defense
mechanisms against evolving cyber threats and ensuring data integrity
and confidentiality.</p>

Review: Questionnaire Analysis</h1>
<p>A thorough review of the organizational security questionnaire

security controls. While some fundamental controls are effectively
managed, notable deficiencies exist, particularly concerning robust
authentication for sensitive data and foundational security training for
new personnel. The presence of denotes "Yes" and denotes "No" for each

Questionnaire Gaps</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> The
absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive
data systems presents a critical vulnerability. This control gap
significantly elevates the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches
if authentication credentials are compromised through phishing, malware,
or other means.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Insufficient Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong> The lack of mandatory security awareness training
for new employees exposes the organization to heightened risks from
social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) right from the
start of an employee’s tenure. New hires may inadvertently introduce
vulnerabilities or fall victim to common scams without proper initial
education.</p></li>

<p>The network scan identified an open MySQL port (3306) on the target
host. The service is running MySQL version 5.7.33. This version is
critically outdated, having reached End-of-Life (EOL) in October 2023.
EOL software no longer receives crucial security patches, rendering it
highly susceptible to known vulnerabilities and future exploits. The
direct network exposure of this unsupported and vulnerable database
service constitutes a severe and immediate risk to the organization’s
data integrity and security.</p>

<p>This section consolidates all identified risks, combining insights
from the security questionnaire, technical scan findings, and

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actionable recommendations are provided to address the
identified risks and significantly improve <strong>Granite
Shield</strong>’s overall cybersecurity posture. Prioritization is
indicated by the categorization of recommendations.</p>
<h2 id="critical-recommendations">Critical Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade/Replace End-of-Life MySQL:</strong> Immediately
prioritize the upgrade of the MySQL database from version 5.7.33 to a
currently supported and patched version (e.g., MySQL 8.0). Develop a
clear migration plan, conduct thorough testing, and ensure a robust
backup strategy is in place. If an immediate upgrade is not feasible,
implement strong compensating controls, such as strict network isolation
and application-level access controls, to minimize exposure.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="high-priority-recommendations">High Priority
Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> Deploy
and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all sensitive data
systems and applications. This critical security measure adds an
essential layer of protection, significantly reducing the impact of
compromised credentials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Isolate/Firewall MySQL Port 3306:</strong> Restrict
network access to MySQL port 3306 (on ) using firewall rules. Only
permit connections from explicitly authorized internal IP addresses or
specific application servers. For any required external administrative
access, mandate the use of a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or secure
jump host.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mandate Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong> Establish and implement a mandatory security
awareness training program for all new hires. This training should be
completed as part of the onboarding process, covering common threats
like phishing, social engineering, malware, and the organization’s
acceptable use policy.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="general-security-enhancements">General Security
Enhancements</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Regular Vulnerability Scanning and Penetration
Testing:</strong> Implement a recurring schedule for both internal and
external vulnerability scans, complemented by periodic penetration
tests. This proactive approach helps to continuously identify and
remediate new exposures.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Comprehensive Patch Management Program:</strong> Develop
and enforce a robust patch management program to ensure all operating
systems, applications, firmware, and network devices are kept up-to-date
with the latest security patches and updates.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop/Review Incident Response Plan:</strong> Ensure
that a well-defined and regularly tested incident response plan is in
place. This plan should detail procedures for detecting, containing,
eradicating, recovering from, and learning from security
incidents.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p><strong>Granite Shield</strong> is currently exposed to several high
and critical cybersecurity risks stemming from outdated software,
directly exposed services, and gaps in security controls. By diligently
implementing the recommended actions, particularly upgrading critical
infrastructure, enhancing access controls with MFA, and investing in
foundational security training, the organization can substantially
strengthen its cybersecurity defenses. A proactive and continuous
commitment to security best practices will be indispensable for
achieving long-term cyber resilience and protecting organizational
assets.</p>
