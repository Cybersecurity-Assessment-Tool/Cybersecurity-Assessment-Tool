<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of <strong>Copperhead
Cables</strong> based on an analysis of provided organizational data,
network scan results, and existing risk information. The assessment
reveals several critical areas for improvement, primarily concerning
foundational security policies and employee training. While technical
scan data was limited in scope, an open SSH port was identified, which
warrants careful review and hardening. Proactive measures, particularly
in policy development and comprehensive security awareness training, are
strongly recommended to enhance the organization’s overall security
resilience and reduce its exposure to common cyber threats.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and enhance the overall
cybersecurity posture of <strong>Copperhead Cables</strong>, the
following actionable recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Draft a comprehensive AUP that clearly outlines employee
responsibilities, acceptable use of company IT resources, internet,
email, and data handling.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all employees review and formally acknowledge (e.g., sign)
the AUP annually or upon significant updates to maintain awareness and
compliance.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Mandatory Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and integrate a mandatory security awareness training
program for all new hires as a part of their onboarding process, ideally
before they gain full access to company systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Training should cover essential topics such as identifying
phishing and social engineering attempts, malware prevention, strong
password hygiene, data handling policies, and incident reporting
procedures.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Annual Security Awareness Training for All
Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement a mandatory annual security awareness training program
for all existing employees to refresh their knowledge and inform them of
new and emerging threats.</p></li>
<li><p>Utilize engaging content, real-world examples, and regular
simulated phishing exercises to reinforce learning and evaluate employee
vigilance.</p></li>
<li><p>Track completion rates and conduct follow-up training for
employees who may require additional guidance.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Harden Open SSH Port (Port 22):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Access Restriction:</strong> Review the necessity of
keeping SSH open to the entire internet. If possible, restrict access to
trusted IP addresses or networks only using firewall rules. Consider
using a VPN for all administrative access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Authentication Strengthening:</strong> Ensure SSH is
configured to use strong, key-based authentication exclusively,
disabling password authentication entirely. Disable direct root
login.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Software Updates:</strong> Keep the SSH server software
updated to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches
and performance improvements.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Monitoring &amp; Prevention:</strong> Implement
rate-limiting, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and
robust logging to defend against brute-force attacks and monitor for
suspicious activity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Port Obfuscation (Optional):</strong> Consider changing
the default SSH port (22) to a non-standard port to reduce automated
scanning noise, though this is not a security measure in
itself.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p><strong>Copperhead Cables</strong> has demonstrated a commendable
commitment to Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across critical access
points, establishing a robust technical control. However, significant
gaps exist in foundational cybersecurity policies and consistent
employee security awareness training. Addressing these “human factor”
risks through the development of comprehensive policies and implementing
mandatory, regular training programs, coupled with prudent technical
hardening measures for exposed services like SSH, will substantially
improve the organization’s defensive posture against common cyber
threats. Continued vigilance and a proactive, holistic approach to
cybersecurity are essential for long-term resilience and safeguarding
organizational assets.</p>
