<p>This report provides a cybersecurity posture assessment for
<strong>Verve &amp; Vigor</strong> based on available organizational
data and a security control questionnaire. Due to issues with the
provided input data, detailed technical network scan results and
pre-existing vulnerability information could not be fully processed or
included.</p>
<p>The assessment highlights several critical gaps in security controls,
primarily related to the insufficient implementation of Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for email access and computer logins. Furthermore,
the organization lacks regular, annual security awareness training for
all employees, which presents a significant human-element risk. While an
acceptable use policy is in place and new employees receive initial
security training, these critical deficiencies require immediate
attention to strengthen the overall security posture and mitigate
high-impact risks.</p>

<p>A network scan was intended to be performed against target . However,
the provided JSON data for the network scan results was malformed and
could not be parsed. Therefore, detailed technical findings regarding
open ports, running services, products, and their versions cannot be

of outdated software, vulnerable services, or misconfigured network
devices.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the available organizational data and security control
review, several significant risks have been identified. The inability to
parse network scan data and pre-existing vulnerabilities means this risk

<td style="text-align: left;">Critical</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The absence of MFA for computer logins
dramatically increases the risk of unauthorized access to internal
systems. If user credentials are stolen or guessed, attackers can gain
initial access, facilitate lateral movement, and potentially escalate
privileges without an additional authentication factor.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;">High</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The lack of regular, mandatory security
awareness training for all employees leaves the organization vulnerable
to evolving social engineering tactics, such as sophisticated phishing,
ransomware, and social engineering attacks. Human error remains a
leading cause of security incidents, and continuous training is vital to
mitigate this risk.</td>

(Input_3)</h2>
<p>The provided JSON data for existing vulnerabilities was malformed and
could not be parsed. Therefore, a review or assessment of any
pre-existing organizational risks, as documented by the client, cannot
be detailed in this report. This represents a gap in understanding the
full scope of the organization’s current vulnerability landscape.</p>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified critical gaps and enhance the overall
cybersecurity posture of <strong>Verve &amp; Vigor</strong>, the
following recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email
Access:</strong> Urgently prioritize and implement MFA for all email
accounts across the organization. This should be a mandatory requirement
for all users. Consider robust MFA methods such as hardware tokens,
FIDO2 keys, or authenticator apps, rather than SMS-based MFA where
possible.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer
Logins:</strong> Deploy and enforce MFA for all computer login
processes, particularly for accounts with elevated privileges and access
to critical systems. This will significantly reduce the risk of
unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Annual Security Awareness Training
Program:</strong> Develop and implement a comprehensive, mandatory
security awareness training program for all employees, to be conducted
at least once per year. This training should cover current threats,
including advanced phishing techniques, malware identification, secure
password practices, data handling, and incident reporting
procedures.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct a Comprehensive Network Vulnerability
Scan:</strong> Arrange for a professional, authenticated external and
internal network vulnerability scan. This scan should identify open
ports, running services, software versions (including end-of-life or
outdated software), and potential misconfigurations that could expose
the organization to attack. Ensure the scan results are properly
recorded and accessible for detailed analysis and remediation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Perform a Dedicated Vulnerability Assessment:</strong>
Conduct a thorough assessment of existing vulnerabilities within the
organization’s infrastructure and applications. This includes reviewing
security configurations, patch management status, and
application-specific weaknesses to identify, prioritize, and remediate
known exposures effectively.</p></li>
