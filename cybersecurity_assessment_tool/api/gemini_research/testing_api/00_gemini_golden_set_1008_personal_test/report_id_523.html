<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of Wildfire
Communications, based on an analysis of provided organizational data, a
security questionnaire, and a network scan.</p>
<p>The assessment reveals a mixed security posture. On the positive
side, Wildfire Communications has implemented Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for email access and conducts annual security
awareness training for all employees.</p>
<p>However, several critical gaps and high-priority risks were
identified. Most notably, there is a lack of MFA enforcement for both
computer logins and access to sensitive data systems, leaving core
assets vulnerable to credential compromise. Furthermore, the
organization currently lacks a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP) and does not provide initial security awareness training for new
employees, increasing risks associated with human error and insider
threats.</p>
<p>From a technical perspective, an open SSH (Secure Shell) port was
identified on the scanned IPv6 target (). While SSH is a common
administrative tool, its presence necessitates rigorous secure
configuration to prevent unauthorized access.</p>
<p>The recommendations provided aim to address these findings by
strengthening foundational security controls, particularly in MFA
implementation, policy development, employee training, and secure server
configuration. Addressing these areas will significantly enhance
Wildfire Communications’ defense against common cyber threats.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To enhance the overall cybersecurity posture of Wildfire
Communications, the following actionable recommendations are provided
based on the assessment findings. Prioritizing these steps will
significantly mitigate identified risks.</p>
<h2 id="multi-factor-authentication-mfa">Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Logins:</strong> Immediately
deploy and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication for all employee computer
logins. This dramatically reduces the risk of unauthorized access due to
compromised credentials, even if passwords are stolen.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong>
Enforce MFA for access to all systems containing or processing sensitive
organizational data. This adds a critical layer of security, protecting
against data breaches and ensuring compliance with data protection
regulations.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="policy-and-training">Policy and Training</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create and formally implement a comprehensive AUP that
clearly outlines employee responsibilities and acceptable practices
regarding the use of organizational IT resources. Ensure all employees
acknowledge, understand, and adhere to this policy annually.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Initiate Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong> Establish a mandatory, comprehensive security
awareness training program for all new hires. This training should be
completed as part of their onboarding process and cover common cyber
threats (e.g., phishing, malware), secure password hygiene, and the
newly implemented AUP.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enhance Annual Security Awareness Training:</strong>
While annual training is currently conducted, review and update the
curriculum regularly to ensure it addresses the most current threats,
incorporates new policies (like the AUP), and reinforces the importance
of MFA and other security best practices.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="network-security">Network Security</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Secure SSH Configuration:</strong> For the identified
open SSH port on , perform the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Verify Product/Version:</strong> Accurately determine the
exact SSH server product and version installed to check for any known
vulnerabilities. Patch or upgrade immediately if an outdated or
vulnerable version is found.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Disable Password Authentication:</strong> Configure the
SSH daemon to only allow key-based authentication. This prevents
brute-force attacks against user passwords.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use Strong Keys:</strong> Ensure all authorized SSH keys
are strong (e.g., RSA 4096-bit or ED25519) and properly managed, with
strong passphrases.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Restrict Access by IP:</strong> Implement firewall rules
to limit SSH access to only necessary administrative IP addresses or
subnets.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Rate Limiting:</strong> Configure firewall
rules or SSH daemon settings (e.g., ‘MaxAuthTries‘, ‘LoginGraceTime‘) to
rate limit connection attempts, further protecting against brute-force
and denial-of-service attempts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Change Default Port (Optional but Recommended):</strong>
Consider changing the default SSH port (22) to a non-standard port to
reduce exposure to automated scanning and opportunistic
attacks.</p></li>
