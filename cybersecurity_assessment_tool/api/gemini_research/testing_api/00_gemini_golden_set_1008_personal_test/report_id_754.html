<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for <strong>Hearth &amp; Home</strong>. The assessment is based on a
review of organizational security controls via a questionnaire and an
external network scan.</p>
<p>Overall, <strong>Hearth &amp; Home</strong> demonstrates some
foundational security practices, such as an acceptable use policy and
annual security awareness training. However, significant gaps were
identified, primarily concerning the implementation of Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and sensitive data systems, and
a lack of dedicated security awareness training for new employees. The
external network scan, targeting <code>[Target IP]</code>, did not
identify any immediate open ports or services. This finding must be
interpreted with the understanding that the scan was limited to the
provided target IP and could not provide an exhaustive view of all
external assets. No pre-existing vulnerabilities were reported in the
provided data.</p>
<p>These identified gaps represent critical risks that could be
exploited, leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, or other
adverse security incidents. Immediate attention and remediation efforts
are strongly recommended to enhance the organization’s overall security
posture.</p>

Review: Questionnaire Analysis</h1>
<p>A questionnaire was used to assess the current state of key security
controls within <strong>Hearth &amp; Home</strong>. The responses
indicate several areas of strength and significant areas requiring
improvement. The table below summarizes the findings, with a indicating
"Yes" and an indicating "No."</p>

<h2 id="key-findings-from-questionnaire">Key Findings from
Questionnaire</h2>
<p>The following critical gaps and high risks were identified from the
questionnaire responses:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins</strong>: Not requiring
Multi-Factor Authentication for computer logins significantly increases
the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or
compromised.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems</strong>: Similar
to computer logins, the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems poses
a critical risk to data confidentiality and integrity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Security Awareness Training for New
Employees</strong>: While annual training is conducted for all
employees, the lack of initial security awareness training for new
employees means they may not be adequately prepared to identify and
mitigate common cyber threats from day one.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed targeting
<code>[Target IP]</code>, which corresponds to the client’s external IP
address, <code>170.196.176.98</code>. The metadata for the scan did not
include a specific scan date.</p>
<h2 id="external-network-scan-findings">External Network Scan
Findings</h2>
<p>The provided scan data for <code>[Target IP]</code> indicates that no
open ports or services were identified during the assessment. This
suggests that the external perimeter of the scanned target is either
well-hardened or that the scope of the scan data provided was limited to
an IP address with no active services.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: An empty scan result does not inherently mean
there are no vulnerabilities. It simply means that no accessible
services were found from the external perspective for the specifically
targeted IP address with the provided scan data. Further internal
assessments or more extensive external scanning across a wider IP
range/domain could reveal additional findings.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the security questionnaire and technical
scan data, the following risks have been identified. No pre-existing
vulnerabilities were provided in the input data.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified gaps and enhance the overall cybersecurity
posture of <strong>Hearth &amp; Home</strong>, the following
recommendations are provided:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Logins</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action</strong>: Mandate Multi-Factor Authentication for
all user logins to company computers and internal systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit</strong>: Significantly reduces the risk of
unauthorized access even if primary credentials are stolen, forming a
stronger defense against credential-based attacks.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action</strong>: Enforce MFA for accessing all systems
containing or processing sensitive organizational or customer
data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit</strong>: Provides a critical layer of defense
against data breaches and unauthorized data access, safeguarding
confidential information.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Onboarding Security Awareness
Training</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action</strong>: Develop and implement mandatory
cybersecurity awareness training as part of the onboarding process for
all new employees. This training should cover common threats like
phishing, malware, social engineering, and proper data
handling.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit</strong>: Equips new hires with essential
security knowledge from day one, reducing their susceptibility to
cyberattacks and improving overall human firewall
effectiveness.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Regularly Review and Update Security
Policies</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action</strong>: Conduct an annual review of the
Acceptable Use Policy and other security policies to ensure they remain
current with evolving threats and organizational practices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit</strong>: Maintains policy relevance and
effectiveness in guiding employee behavior and organizational security,
adapting to new challenges.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Regular and Comprehensive Technical
Assessments</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action</strong>: Perform regular external and internal
vulnerability scans, penetration tests, and configuration audits across
the entire IT infrastructure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit</strong>: Proactively identifies technical
vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and potential attack vectors before
they can be exploited. This is especially important given the lack of
findings in the initial external scan, which may have been limited in
scope.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p><strong>Hearth &amp; Home</strong> has a foundation of cybersecurity
practices, but critical areas require immediate attention. By
implementing the recommended Multi-Factor Authentication controls and
enhancing security awareness training, particularly for new employees,
the organization can significantly mature its security posture and
reduce its overall risk profile. Ongoing vigilance and continuous
security improvements are essential in today’s dynamic threat
landscape.</p>
