<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report summarizes the cybersecurity posture of Sovereign Trust
based on a network scan, organizational security questionnaire
responses, and an analysis of existing risk data.</p>
<p>Key findings indicate critical vulnerabilities related to an outdated
Nginx web server, a lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
computer logins, and significant gaps in the organization’s security
awareness training program. While some foundational controls are in
place, these identified deficiencies pose substantial risks to the
organization’s information assets and could lead to unauthorized access,
data breaches, or operational disruption if not addressed promptly. This
report outlines these risks and provides actionable recommendations to
enhance the overall security posture of Sovereign Trust.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-questionnaire-gaps">Analysis of
Questionnaire Gaps</h2>
<p>The questionnaire highlights several critical gaps in Sovereign
Trust’s security posture:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins:</strong> Not requiring
Multi-Factor Authentication for computer logins significantly increases
the risk of unauthorized access. If an attacker compromises a user’s
credentials (e.g., via phishing), they could gain immediate access to
internal systems without a second authentication factor.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Insufficient Security Awareness Training:</strong> The
absence of security awareness training for both new and existing
employees is a major human-factor vulnerability. Employees untrained in
cybersecurity best practices are more susceptible to social engineering
attacks, phishing, malware, and other common threats, potentially
leading to data breaches or system compromises.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was conducted on the target system to identify open
ports, running services, and associated versions.</p>

</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="detailed-findings">Detailed Findings</h2>
<p>The scan identified the following open port and service:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Host:</strong> <code>192.168.10.5</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Port:</strong> 443/tcp</p></li>
<li><p><strong>State:</strong> Open</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Service:</strong> HTTPS</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Product:</strong> Nginx</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.18.0</p></li>
<li><p><strong>SSL Certificate Common Name:</strong>
<code>www.acme-corp.com</code></p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="technical-analysis">Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>The Nginx web server identified on port 443 is running version
1.18.0. Nginx 1.18.0 was released in April 2020 and is an older,
unsupported stable version. Current stable releases are significantly
newer (e.g., 1.24.x or 1.26.x). Running outdated software is a critical
security vulnerability as it likely contains known security flaws that
have been patched in more recent versions. This exposes the web server
and potentially the underlying infrastructure to various exploits.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the security questionnaire and technical
scan results, the following high-priority risks have been
identified:</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and enhance Sovereign Trust’s
cybersecurity posture, the following recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer
Logins:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Deploy a robust MFA solution for all computer login processes
across the organization. This should be a mandatory requirement for all
user accounts, especially those with privileged access.</p></li>
<li><p>Educate employees thoroughly on the importance, benefits, and
proper usage of MFA to ensure smooth adoption and compliance.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Update Nginx Web Server to a Supported
Version:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Immediately plan and execute an upgrade of the Nginx web server
on <code>192.168.10.5</code> (or the production system it represents) to
the latest stable and supported version (e.g., Nginx 1.24.x or
1.26.x).</p></li>
<li><p>Establish a regular patching and update schedule for all server
software, operating systems, and applications to ensure continuous
protection against known vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p>After the update, conduct a vulnerability scan and functional
testing to confirm the resolution of the outdated software issue and
ensure application stability.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish a Comprehensive Security Awareness Training
Program:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and implement a mandatory security awareness training
program for all new employees as part of their onboarding
process.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct mandatory annual security awareness training for all
existing employees. This training should cover topics such as
identifying phishing and social engineering attempts, best practices for
strong passwords, safe internet usage, data handling policies, and
incident reporting procedures.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider implementing periodic simulated phishing campaigns to
test employee vigilance and reinforce training concepts.</p></li>
