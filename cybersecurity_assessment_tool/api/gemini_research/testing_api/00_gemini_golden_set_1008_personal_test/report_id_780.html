<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture assessment for Aventine
Research, based on a review of organizational security controls via a
questionnaire. Due to issues with the provided data, a comprehensive
network scan could not be performed, and pre-existing vulnerability data
was unavailable.</p>
<p>The assessment of organizational controls identified critical gaps,
specifically the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer
logins and the absence of a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP).
These areas represent significant risks that could be exploited by
adversaries or lead to internal policy violations. While the
organization does implement MFA for email and sensitive data systems and
conducts security awareness training, the identified gaps in
foundational controls require immediate attention.</p>
<p>Overall, Aventine Research’s cybersecurity posture, based on
available information, requires improvement in critical areas.
Recommendations are provided to address the identified deficiencies and
enhance the organization’s security stance.</p>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A review of the organization’s security controls was conducted based
on responses to a security questionnaire. The findings are summarized

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>The provided network scan data (Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON) was
malformed and could not be parsed or analyzed. As such, no technical
vulnerabilities or open ports could be identified through an automated
scan for the target . A comprehensive assessment of technical security
posture requires reliable scan data.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the available information, the following risks have been
identified. It is important to note that due to the unavailability of
network scan data and pre-existing vulnerability information, this risk
assessment is not exhaustive and focuses primarily on gaps identified
through the security control questionnaire.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and enhance Aventine Research’s
cybersecurity posture, the following recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer
Logins:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Deploy and enforce MFA for all employee and administrative
computer logins to significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access
due to compromised credentials.</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluate solutions such as Windows Hello for Business, FIDO2
security keys, or enterprise MFA solutions integrated with Active
Directory/identity providers.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create a clear and comprehensive AUP that defines the acceptable
use of all company-provided IT assets, networks, and data.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure the AUP covers topics such as internet usage, email usage,
software installation, data handling, and privacy.</p></li>
<li><p>Distribute the AUP to all employees, obtain signed
acknowledgements, and integrate it into new employee onboarding and
annual security awareness training.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Regular Technical Vulnerability
Assessments:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Establish a recurring schedule for external and internal network
vulnerability scanning and penetration testing.</p></li>
<li><p>Utilize the results of these assessments to identify and
remediate technical vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and outdated
software versions.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish a Vulnerability Management
Program:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement a formal process for identifying, assessing, tracking,
and remediating vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p>Prioritize remediation efforts based on severity, exploitability,
and potential impact to the organization.</p></li>
<li><p>Regularly review and update existing systems and applications to
ensure they are patched and configured securely.</p></li>
</ul></li>
