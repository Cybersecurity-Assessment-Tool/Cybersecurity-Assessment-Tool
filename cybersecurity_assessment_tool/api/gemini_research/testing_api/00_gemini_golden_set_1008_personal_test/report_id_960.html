<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of <strong>Zenith
Point</strong> based on an organizational questionnaire, an attempted
network scan, and an attempt to review existing vulnerability data. The
assessment highlights critical gaps in foundational security controls,
particularly concerning Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email
access and the absence of an employee acceptable use policy.
Furthermore, the inability to parse network scan data and pre-existing
vulnerability data indicates a significant lack of visibility into the
external attack surface and internal risk management practices. While
some positive security practices are in place (e.g., MFA for computer
logins and regular security awareness training), the identified critical
deficiencies and data visibility issues pose substantial risks that
require immediate attention.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-questionnaire-gaps">Analysis of
Questionnaire Gaps:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA for Email Access:</strong> The absence of
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access is a critical
vulnerability. Email is a primary vector for phishing attacks and
account compromise. Without MFA, compromised credentials can grant
attackers full access to an employee’s inbox, leading to business email
compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, or further internal network
penetration.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> The lack
of an AUP means employees may not be fully aware of their
responsibilities regarding the use of company IT resources. This can
lead to inappropriate behavior, increased risk of malware infections,
data leakage, and potential legal or compliance issues. An AUP sets
clear boundaries and expectations for employee conduct.</p></li>

(Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON)</h2>
<p>The provided network scan data was found to be corrupted or malformed
and could not be parsed for analysis. As such, a detailed assessment of
the external network attack surface, including open ports, running
services, and identified vulnerabilities, cannot be performed at this
time.</p>

<li><p><strong>Findings:</strong> No parseable technical scan findings
available.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="implications-of-missing-data">Implications of
Missing Data:</h2>
<p>The inability to obtain and parse network scan data represents a
significant blind spot in the organization’s security posture. Without
this information, it is impossible to determine if the external
perimeter harbors open services with known vulnerabilities, outdated
software versions, or misconfigurations that could be exploited by
attackers. This lack of visibility prevents a proactive approach to
securing the network edge.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>

identified:</p>

Vulnerabilities (Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON)</h2>
<p>The provided data for pre-existing vulnerabilities was found to be
corrupted or malformed and could not be parsed. Consequently, no
existing vulnerabilities could be extracted or incorporated into this
assessment. This further contributes to the organization’s lack of a
comprehensive risk management overview.</p>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified gaps and strengthen the cybersecurity
posture of <strong>Zenith Point</strong>, the following recommendations
are provided:</p>
<h2 id="immediate-critical-actions">Immediate Critical Actions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Access:</strong> Immediately
deploy and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email
accounts across the organization. This is the single most effective
control against credential theft and phishing attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a clear, concise, and comprehensive AUP that
outlines employee responsibilities and permissible use of company IT
resources. Ensure all employees are trained on the AUP and acknowledge
their understanding and compliance.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="data-visibility-and-assessment-enhancements">Data Visibility and
Assessment Enhancements</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Conduct a Comprehensive External Network Scan:</strong>
Perform a professional and thorough external network scan (e.g., using
Nmap and vulnerability scanners) of all public-facing IP addresses and
domains. This will identify open ports, running services, software
versions, and potential vulnerabilities. Ensure the results are properly
recorded and accessible for analysis.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish a Vulnerability Management Program:</strong>
Implement a structured program for identifying, assessing, tracking, and
remediating vulnerabilities. This should include regular internal and
external scanning, penetration testing, and a defined process for
addressing discovered risks.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="general-security-best-practices">General Security Best
Practices</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Regular Review of Security Controls:</strong>
Periodically review all security controls and policies, especially those
identified as "No" in the questionnaire, to ensure they meet current
best practices and organizational needs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Continuous Security Awareness:</strong> Maintain and
expand security awareness training programs to include common attack
vectors, policy updates, and the importance of reporting suspicious
activities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Incident Response Planning:</strong> Ensure an up-to-date
incident response plan is in place and regularly tested, addressing
potential scenarios like email account compromise or data
breaches.</p></li>
