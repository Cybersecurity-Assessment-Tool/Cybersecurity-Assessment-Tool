<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a cybersecurity posture assessment for Apex
Legends Group based on supplied organizational data and a security
questionnaire. Due to unparseable or missing input data, no network scan
results or pre-existing vulnerability data were available for this
assessment.</p>
<p>The primary findings indicate significant critical gaps in the
organization’s security controls, notably the complete absence of
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across critical access points
including email, computer login, and sensitive data systems. This
dramatically increases the risk of unauthorized access and data
breaches. Furthermore, a high-risk gap was identified regarding the lack
of security awareness training for new employees, leaving the
organization vulnerable to social engineering from its newest hires.</p>
<p>Immediate action is required to implement MFA across all identified
systems and establish a robust security awareness training program for
all employees, especially new hires. These steps are crucial to mitigate
the most pressing risks identified.</p>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of MFA for Email Access</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Without Multi-Factor Authentication, email
accounts are highly susceptible to credential stuffing, phishing, and
brute-force attacks, potentially leading to business email compromise
(BEC), data exfiltration, and impersonation.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Critical</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of MFA for Computer Login</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Without MFA, user accounts on computers
(endpoints) are vulnerable to unauthorized access if passwords are
stolen or guessed. This increases the risk of lateral movement within
the network, malware propagation, and unauthorized system control.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data
Systems</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Absence of MFA on systems containing
sensitive data allows attackers with compromised credentials direct
access to confidential information. This poses a severe data breach
risk, regulatory non-compliance issues, and significant reputational
damage.</td>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified critical and high-risk gaps, Apex Legends
Group should prioritize the following actions:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email
Access:</strong> Immediately deploy and enforce MFA for all user
accounts accessing organizational email. This should be a top priority
to protect against common attack vectors like phishing and credential
theft.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer
Login:</strong> Implement MFA for all corporate computer logins,
including desktop workstations, laptops, Virtual Desktop Infrastructure
(VDI), and VPN access. This significantly enhances endpoint
security.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive
Data Systems:</strong> Ensure all systems and applications that store,
process, or transmit sensitive organizational or client data are
protected by MFA. This is crucial for preventing unauthorized access to
critical information.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Mandatory New Employee Security Awareness
Training:</strong> Develop and implement a comprehensive security
awareness training program for all new employees during their onboarding
process. This training should cover phishing, social engineering,
password hygiene, and the organization’s acceptable use policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Maintain Annual Security Awareness Training:</strong>
Continue to ensure all existing employees receive regular, at least
annual, security awareness training to reinforce best practices and
educate them on emerging threats.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Address Missing Data Points:</strong> It is strongly
recommended that Apex Legends Group review and provide complete and
accurate data for future assessments, particularly for network scan
results and pre-existing vulnerabilities, to enable a more thorough and
comprehensive cybersecurity posture analysis.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These recommendations, if implemented diligently, will significantly
improve Apex Legends Group’s overall cybersecurity posture and reduce
exposure to common and critical threats.</p>
