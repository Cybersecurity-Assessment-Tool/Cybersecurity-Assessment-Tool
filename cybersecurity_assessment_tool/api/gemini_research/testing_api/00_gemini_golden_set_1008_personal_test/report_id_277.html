<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">1. Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of Summit Peak Partners
based on a network scan, organizational security questionnaire, and
current risk register review. The assessment reveals several critical
areas requiring immediate attention, primarily related to multi-factor
authentication (MFA) implementation and foundational security awareness
training for new employees. Additionally, an outdated web server
component was identified during the technical scan, posing a potential
vulnerability risk. Addressing these gaps is crucial for enhancing the
organization’s resilience against common cyber threats and protecting
sensitive information.</p>

Results</h1>
<p>A targeted network scan was performed on the internal host on . The
scan identified one open port with an associated service.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="technical-analysis">4.2. Technical
Analysis</h2>
<p>The Nginx web server running on port 443 is identified as version .
This version was released in 2020 and is now several major versions
behind the current stable (e.g., 1.24.x) and mainline (e.g., 1.25.x)
releases. While Nginx 1.18.0 may have received some security updates as
part of its stable branch, running significantly outdated software
increases the risk of known vulnerabilities being exploited, as patches
for these issues are often released in newer versions. Maintaining
current, supported versions is a fundamental security best practice.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the SSL certificate used by the server has a Common Name
(CN) of , which does not match the organization’s reported website
domain . Given that this is an internal IP address (), this mismatch
might be an intentional configuration for a specific application or
service (e.g., a third-party appliance or a development server).
However, it can also indicate a potential misconfiguration, an unmanaged
asset, or a service not directly associated with the organization’s
primary domain, potentially leading to confusion or trust issues if ever
exposed externally.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">6. Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and strengthen Summit Peak Partners’
cybersecurity posture, the following recommendations are provided,
prioritized by their potential impact and urgency:</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="immediate-actions-high-priority">6.1.
Immediate Actions (High Priority)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Email Access:</strong> Immediately deploy and enforce MFA
for all email accounts across the organization. Prioritize strong MFA
methods such as FIDO2 security keys or authenticator applications over
less secure options like SMS-based MFA.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Computer Login:</strong> Implement MFA for all user and
administrative computer logins. Integrate with existing directory
services (e.g., Active Directory, Azure AD) where possible for
streamlined deployment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> Prioritize implementing
MFA for all systems containing or processing sensitive organizational
data. This includes databases, file shares, CRM systems, and other
critical business applications.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct New Employee Security Awareness
Training:</strong> Develop and implement a mandatory security awareness
training program for all new hires. This training should be completed
before they are granted access to company systems and should cover
common threats like phishing, social engineering, and safe internet
practices.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="short-term-actions-medium-priority">6.2.
Short-Term Actions (Medium Priority)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Update Nginx Web Server:</strong> Plan and execute an
upgrade of the Nginx web server on to a currently supported stable
version (e.g., 1.24.x or later). Ensure proper testing is conducted in a
staging environment before deploying to production to minimize service
disruption.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Investigate SSL Certificate Mismatch:</strong> Determine
the underlying reason for the SSL certificate common name () not
matching the organizational domain (). If this server is intended for
services, procure and install a certificate with the correct common
name. If it serves a different, documented purpose, ensure proper
configuration management.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="long-term-actions-ongoing">6.3. Long-Term
Actions (Ongoing)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Enhance Existing Security Awareness Training:</strong>
Review and expand the annual security awareness training for all
employees to cover emerging threats, advanced phishing techniques,
social engineering tactics, and organizational security policies more
comprehensively. Incorporate interactive modules and regular simulated
phishing exercises.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Vulnerability Management Program:</strong>
Establish a routine schedule for vulnerability scanning and penetration
testing of internal and external systems to proactively identify and
address security weaknesses before they can be exploited.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Robust Patch Management Program:</strong> Implement a
comprehensive patch management program to ensure all operating systems,
applications, and network devices are kept up-to-date with the latest
security patches in a timely manner.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Asset Inventory and Management:</strong> Maintain an
accurate and up-to-date inventory of all IT assets, including their
purpose, configuration, ownership, and patch status, to prevent
unmanaged or forgotten systems from introducing risks.</p></li>
