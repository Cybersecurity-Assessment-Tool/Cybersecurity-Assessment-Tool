<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of <strong>Iron Bridge
Legal</strong> based on a review of organizational data, a security
questionnaire, and limited network scan results. The assessment reveals
several critical security gaps. Primarily, there is a complete absence
of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across key access points (email,
computers, sensitive data systems) and a lack of comprehensive employee
security awareness training. The provided network scan data was minimal
but identified an open Port 80 on an internal target, representing a
potential exposure point. The existing risks provided also contained an
unusual entry with zero severity, which has been noted as informational.
Addressing the fundamental gaps in MFA implementation and establishing
regular security training should be the immediate priority to
significantly enhance the organization’s defensive posture against
common cyber threats.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-security-control-gaps">Analysis of Security Control
Gaps</h2>
<p>The review highlights critical deficiencies in foundational security
practices:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong>
MFA is not required for email access, computer logins, or sensitive data
systems. This is a severe vulnerability, as compromised credentials
(e.g., through phishing or brute force) could grant attackers full
access to critical organizational resources with minimal effort. MFA is
a cornerstone of modern identity and access management and significantly
reduces the risk of account compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Security Awareness Training:</strong> The
organization does not conduct security awareness training for new
employees or annual refresher training for all employees. This leaves
the workforce highly susceptible to social engineering attacks (e.g.,
phishing, pretexting, malware delivery) and reduces their ability to
identify and report potential security incidents. Human error is a
leading cause of security breaches, and ongoing training is essential to
mitigate this risk.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> While an AUP is in
place, its effectiveness is diminished without accompanying security
awareness training to ensure employees understand and adhere to its
principles.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A limited network scan was performed to identify open ports on a
specified internal target.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Target:</strong> <code>172.16.0.1</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not provided in the input
data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Identified Open Ports:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 80 (HTTP):</strong> This port was found to be open.
No specific service name, product, or version information was available
from the provided scan data for this port.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of Technical
Findings</h2>
<p>The presence of an open Port 80, typically used for unencrypted web
traffic, on an internal network segment requires further investigation.
Without service or version information, it is impossible to definitively
determine if this represents a vulnerable application or service.
However, any open port on an internal network presents a potential
attack surface. If an outdated, misconfigured, or unpatched web server
or application is running on this port, it could be exploited to gain
unauthorized access, exfiltrate data, or escalate privileges within the
network.</p>

<h2 id="identified-critical-risks">Identified Critical Risks</h2>
<p>The most pressing risks for <strong>Iron Bridge Legal</strong>
are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> This
is the single most critical vulnerability identified. Without MFA, a
simple phishing attack or brute-force attempt against weak passwords can
lead to complete compromise of user accounts and subsequent unauthorized
access to internal systems and data. This poses an immediate and severe
threat to data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Insufficient Security Awareness Training:</strong> A
well-trained workforce is the first line of defense against many cyber
threats. The absence of both initial and annual security training leaves
employees as significant vectors for attacks, such as ransomware
delivery via malicious email attachments or credential harvesting
through deceptive websites.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and improve the overall
cybersecurity posture of <strong>Iron Bridge Legal</strong>, the
following actionable recommendations are provided.</p>
<h2 id="immediate-actions-high-priority">Immediate Actions (High
Priority)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mandate MFA for all email accounts, especially for administrators
and users with access to sensitive information.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement MFA for all computer logins, particularly for
privileged accounts and devices accessing sensitive data.</p></li>
<li><p>Deploy MFA for access to all sensitive data systems and
applications where feasible.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Initiate Basic Security Awareness Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Conduct immediate mandatory security awareness training for all
employees, focusing on phishing recognition, strong password best
practices, safe internet usage, and the importance of reporting
suspicious activity.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all new hires receive security awareness training as part
of their onboarding process.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Investigate Open Port 80:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Immediately identify the service running on Port 80 on
<code>172.16.0.1</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Determine if the service is necessary for business operations. If
not, close the port or remove the service.</p></li>
<li><p>If the service is necessary, ensure the service and underlying
operating system are fully patched and configured securely. If sensitive
information is exchanged, consider migrating to HTTPS (Port 443) with a
valid SSL/TLS certificate.</p></li>
</ul></li>
