<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report presents a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for Neon Pulse Entertainment, derived from a recent network scan,
responses to a security questionnaire, and a review of existing
organizational risks. Key findings highlight critical deficiencies in
fundamental security policies and employee training, which significantly
elevate the overall organizational risk profile. While the technical
scan on the specified target showed a secure state for the monitored
port, the broader human and process-related vulnerabilities require
immediate attention to strengthen the organization’s defenses against
modern cyber threats.</p>

Review (Questionnaire Analysis)</h1>
<p>A detailed review of the provided security questionnaire responses
reveals the organization’s current implementation of various security
controls. While the adoption of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across
several critical access points is commendable, significant gaps exist in
foundational areas such as policy enforcement and security awareness
training.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-questionnaire-gaps">Analysis of
Questionnaire Gaps:</h2>
<p>The absence of an employee acceptable use policy (AUP) is a critical
oversight. Without a formal AUP, employees may be unaware of their
responsibilities regarding the proper use of company IT assets, data
handling procedures, and acceptable online behavior, leading to
potential misuse, data leakage, or compliance issues.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the complete lack of structured security awareness
training–both for new hires and on an annual basis for all
employees–represents a substantial human-factor risk. Employees are
often the weakest link in the security chain; without regular education
on common threats like phishing, social engineering, and malware, the
organization remains highly vulnerable to these prevalent attack
vectors. This gap can lead to compromised credentials, ransomware
infections, and significant operational disruptions.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>

</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="technical-analysis">Technical Analysis:</h2>
<p>The scan results for the target <code>192.168.0.5</code> indicate a
positive security posture for Port 80, as it was found to be closed.
This suggests that a default unencrypted web service is not directly
exposed on this specific host and port. No other open ports or
associated services, products, or versions were identified in the
provided limited scan data. It is important to acknowledge that this
scan was restricted to a single target and did not provide details on
other potential network exposures or deeper vulnerability
assessments.</p>

<p><br />
<em>Note on "Unencrypted Web Server" risk:</em> The existing risk
register indicates a medium-severity risk concerning "Unencrypted Web
Server" due to "Port 80 is open." However, the recent network scan on
<code>192.168.0.5</code> specifically found Port 80 to be
<strong>CLOSED</strong>. This discrepancy suggests that either the risk
has been remediated for the scanned target, or this risk pertains to
other systems within the organization’s infrastructure not covered by
the current scan. It is crucial to verify the status of all web servers
across the organization to ensure comprehensive risk management.</p>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actionable recommendations are provided to address the
identified gaps and enhance the overall cybersecurity posture of Neon
Pulse Entertainment. Prioritization has been given to critical policy
and training deficiencies.</p>
<h2 id="high-priority-policy-training">High Priority (Policy &amp;
Training)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement a Comprehensive Acceptable Use
Policy (AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create a clear, concise, and legally sound AUP that defines
acceptable and unacceptable use of all company IT assets, networks, and
data.</p></li>
<li><p>Mandate that all employees read, understand, and sign the AUP
upon hiring and annually thereafter.</p></li>
<li><p>Integrate AUP review into employee onboarding and offboarding
processes.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish and Execute a Robust Security Awareness
Training Program:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement mandatory security awareness training for all new
employees as part of their onboarding.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct annual, interactive security awareness training for all
existing employees, covering current threats like phishing, ransomware,
social engineering, password best practices, and incident reporting
procedures.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider simulated phishing campaigns to test employee vigilance
and reinforce training concepts.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="medium-priority-technical-verification">Medium Priority
(Technical &amp; Verification)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Verify Web Server Configuration and Encryption Across the
Organization:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Conduct an inventory of all public-facing and internal web
servers to identify instances where unencrypted HTTP (Port 80) might
still be active.</p></li>
<li><p>For any web servers identified with the "Unencrypted Web Server"
risk, ensure that Port 80 is either closed, redirects traffic to HTTPS
(Port 443), or is only accessible internally if not intended for public
exposure.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement and enforce the use of strong SSL/TLS certificates for
all web services transmitting sensitive data to ensure encryption in
transit.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Expand Network Scanning Scope and Frequency:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement regular, comprehensive network scans across all
internal and external IP ranges to proactively identify open ports,
services, and potential vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p>Integrate authenticated vulnerability scanning to detect outdated
software versions, missing patches, and misconfigurations on active
systems.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="general-security-enhancements">General Security
Enhancements</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Test an Incident Response Plan:</strong>
Create a formal incident response plan that outlines procedures for
detecting, containing, eradicating, recovering from, and learning from
cybersecurity incidents. Regularly test this plan through tabletop
exercises.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:</strong>
Schedule periodic third-party security audits and penetration tests to
validate security controls and identify weaknesses that automated tools
might miss.</p></li>
