<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This document presents a comprehensive cybersecurity posture
assessment for True North Travel. The objective of this assessment is to
provide an objective analysis of the organization’s current security
landscape, identify potential vulnerabilities, and offer strategic
recommendations for improvement. The analysis is based on three primary
data sources: an internal network scan, organizational security
questionnaire responses, and a review of existing risk registers. The
insights derived from this analysis aim to empower True North Travel in
strengthening its defenses against evolving cyber threats.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>

<h2 id="analysis-of-security-control-gaps">Analysis of Security Control
Gaps</h2>
<p>The questionnaire results highlight two primary areas of concern:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins:</strong> Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) is a critical defense against credential theft.
While MFA is used for email and sensitive data systems, its absence for
general computer logins represents a significant vulnerability that
could allow attackers to gain access to internal systems with
compromised credentials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong> Although annual training is conducted, the lack of
immediate security awareness training for new employees means that new
hires might not be adequately prepared to identify and respond to common
cyber threats from day one, potentially exposing the organization to
risks such as phishing, social engineering, and malware.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An internal network scan was performed on <code>192.168.10.5</code>
on <code>2025-11-22T10:00:00Z</code>. The scan identified the following
open port and associated services:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP:</strong> <code>192.168.10.5</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Port:</strong> <code>443/TCP</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Service:</strong> HTTPS</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Product:</strong> Nginx</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.18.0</p></li>
<li><p><strong>SSL Certificate Subject:</strong>
<code>commonName=www.acme-corp.com</code></p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="technical-analysis">Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>The primary technical finding is the presence of an Nginx web server
running version 1.18.0. Nginx 1.18.0 was released in April 2020 and is
now considered significantly outdated and end-of-life (EOL). Running EOL
software poses a severe security risk as it no longer receives security
patches for newly discovered vulnerabilities. While port 443 (HTTPS) is
an expected service for a web server, the underlying outdated software
version makes the service highly susceptible to exploitation.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of security controls, technical scan results,
and current risk data, the following risks have been identified:</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and enhance the overall
cybersecurity posture of True North Travel, the following
recommendations are provided:</p>
<h2 id="immediate-actions-high-priority">Immediate Actions (High
Priority)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for All
Computer Logins:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Deploy a robust MFA solution across all organizational computers
and workstations.</p></li>
<li><p>Mandate MFA for all user logins to internal systems and
devices.</p></li>
<li><p>Review and update existing access policies to enforce
MFA.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade Outdated Nginx Web Server:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Immediately plan and execute an upgrade of the Nginx server on
<code>192.168.10.5</code> to the latest stable and supported version
(e.g., Nginx 1.24.x or newer).</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure proper testing is conducted in a staging environment
before deploying to production.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement a regular patch management process for all server
software.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="strategic-actions-medium-priority">Strategic Actions (Medium
Priority)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Mandatory Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and implement an onboarding program that includes
mandatory security awareness training for all new hires before they gain
access to company systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Cover topics such as phishing, social engineering, password
hygiene, data handling, and reporting suspicious activities.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>This cybersecurity posture assessment has provided a snapshot of True
North Travel’s current security landscape as of November 22, 2025. While
the organization demonstrates good practices in some areas, particularly
with MFA for sensitive systems and general security awareness training,
critical vulnerabilities exist. The lack of MFA for computer logins, the
absence of initial security training for new employees, and the use of
severely outdated web server software represent significant risks that
require urgent attention. By diligently implementing the recommendations
outlined in this report, True North Travel can significantly strengthen
its defenses, reduce its attack surface, and foster a more resilient
cybersecurity environment. Continuous monitoring, regular assessments,
and an adaptive security strategy will be crucial for maintaining a
strong security posture in the face of evolving threats.</p>
