<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for <strong>Skyward Bound</strong>, based on a recent network scan,
organizational security questionnaire responses, and pre-existing risk
data.</p>
<p>The assessment indicates a mixed security posture. On the positive
side, a recent network scan did not identify any open ports on the
target <code>192.168.0.5</code>, and port 80 was explicitly found to be
closed. This finding suggests a potential remediation or absence of a
previously identified "Unencrypted Web Server" risk on port 80, which
requires further verification. Furthermore, Multi-factor Authentication
(MFA) is implemented for computer logins and sensitive data systems, and
an acceptable use policy is in place with annual security awareness
training for all employees.</p>
<p>However, critical gaps were identified through the questionnaire,
notably the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access,
posing a significant risk to account compromise. Additionally, new
employees do not receive mandatory security awareness training, which
can lead to increased human-factor vulnerabilities early in their
tenure. Addressing these policy and training deficiencies, alongside
verifying the status of the previously identified technical risk, are
key recommendations to uplift <strong>Skyward Bound</strong>’s security
posture.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A recent network scan was performed using Nmap on the target .</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date</strong>: [Scan Date] <em>(Date not provided in
scan metadata)</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Target Host</strong>:</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Status</strong>: The target host was reported as
UP.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports</strong>: No open ports were identified during
this scan. Specifically, port 80 was found to be
<code>closed</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note:</em> This finding from the current Nmap scan contradicts a
pre-existing risk (TR-1, "Unencrypted Web Server") which stated that
port 80 was open. This discrepancy could indicate successful remediation
of the previous vulnerability or a different scope of scanning. Further
verification is highly recommended to confirm the status of any
previously exposed HTTP services.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section outlines identified risks, combining findings from the
security control review, technical scan results, and pre-existing
vulnerability data. Severity is assessed based on potential impact and
likelihood, utilizing CVSS 3.1 base scores as a reference where
applicable.</p>

<td style="text-align: left;">New employees are particularly susceptible
to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) due to

Communication over unencrypted HTTP (Port 80) is inherently vulnerable
to eavesdropping, data interception, and man-in-the-middle attacks,
compromising data confidentiality and integrity. While the recent scan
shows Port 80 as closed, its prior identification implies a potential
legacy system or misconfiguration that needs to be verified as fully
remediated. If still active on other hosts, this poses a clear
risk.</td>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actionable recommendations are provided to enhance the
cybersecurity posture of <strong>Skyward Bound</strong>, addressing the
identified risks and gaps:</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="immediate-actions">Immediate Actions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Access (CR-1)</strong>: Mandate
and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication for all email accounts across
the organization. This is a critical control for preventing email
account compromise, even if passwords are stolen, significantly reducing
the attack surface for phishing and BEC.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish New Employee Security Awareness Training
(CR-2)</strong>: Develop and implement a mandatory, comprehensive
security awareness training program for all new hires. This training
should be integrated into the onboarding process and cover essential
topics such as phishing recognition, password hygiene, acceptable use
policy, data handling, and incident reporting from their first
day.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="mid-term-actions">Mid-Term Actions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Verify Remediation of Port 80 (TR-1)</strong>: Conduct a
thorough investigation to confirm that the "Unencrypted Web Server" risk
on Port 80 has been fully remediated and is not present on any other
internal or external assets. If any HTTP services are still operational
and intended for public access, ensure they are immediately secured with
HTTPS using valid SSL/TLS certificates.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Vulnerability Scanning</strong>: Implement a
schedule for regular internal and external vulnerability scanning to
proactively identify and address security weaknesses in systems and
applications.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="long-term-strategy">Long-Term Strategy</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Periodic Penetration Testing</strong>: Consider
conducting periodic penetration testing by independent third parties.
This will simulate real-world attacks to identify complex
vulnerabilities that automated scanners might miss.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Continuous Security Awareness Training
Enhancement</strong>: Expand the existing annual security awareness
training to include more advanced topics, simulated phishing exercises,
and role-specific modules to keep all employees updated on evolving
threats and best practices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Policy Review and Updates</strong>: Periodically review
and update the employee acceptable use policy and all other security
policies to ensure they remain relevant, effective, and align with
current industry best practices and regulatory requirements.</p></li>
