</div>
<h2 id="analysis-of-questionnaire-findings">Analysis of Questionnaire
Findings</h2>
<p>The questionnaire responses indicate a mixed security posture.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strengths:</strong> The organization demonstrates good
practices in employee security awareness training (both for new and
existing employees annually) and the implementation of an acceptable use
policy. Furthermore, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required for
access to sensitive data systems, which is a critical control.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gaps:</strong> A significant area of concern is the lack
of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for both email access and computer
logins. These are critical vectors for account compromise and represent
high-severity risks due to the potential for unauthorized access through
stolen or guessed credentials.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was attempted against the target IP address
<code>[Target IP]</code>.</p>
<h2 id="nmap-scan-findings-target-target-ip">Nmap Scan Findings (Target:
<code>[Target IP]</code>)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> No specific scan date metadata was
provided.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports and Services:</strong> No open ports or
services were identified during the scan. This could indicate a
well-hardened external perimeter, or that the target specified was not
accessible for a comprehensive scan. Without further information, it’s
assumed the external posture appears clean from this limited
assessment.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the security questionnaire, and in the
absence of technical scan findings or pre-existing organizational risks,
the primary risks identified are related to foundational security
controls.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and further enhance the cybersecurity
posture of <strong>Sterling Silver</strong>, the following actionable
recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Access:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Mandate Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
all user accounts accessing organizational email services. This should
be a top priority.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Significantly reduces the risk of email account
compromise, even if passwords are stolen, by requiring a second
verification factor. This is crucial given email’s role as a primary
communication and recovery channel.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Logins:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Deploy and enforce MFA for all user logins to
company computers, whether they are domain-joined workstations or
laptops.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Enhances endpoint security by adding an
additional layer of protection, making it much harder for attackers to
gain access to internal systems via compromised credentials.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Vulnerability Scanning and Penetration
Testing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Although no open ports were identified in this
assessment, conducting regular external and internal vulnerability scans
and periodic penetration tests is recommended. This continuous
monitoring helps to identify new exposures as the infrastructure evolves
and provides deeper insight into potential attack paths.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Proactively identifies potential security
weaknesses and exploitable vulnerabilities before they can be leveraged
by malicious actors.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Maintain and Evolve Security Awareness Training
Programs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Continue with the current practice of regular
security awareness training for all employees. Furthermore, ensure the
training content is updated regularly to reflect current threat
landscapes, covering topics such as advanced phishing techniques, social
engineering, and secure browsing habits.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> A well-informed and vigilant workforce is the
first line of defense against many cyber threats and helps to reinforce
a strong security culture.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p><strong>Sterling Silver</strong> demonstrates good foundational
security practices in areas such as security awareness training and
acceptable use policies, which are commendable. However, the critical
absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for both email access and
computer logins presents significant and immediate risks that require
urgent attention. Addressing these MFA gaps will substantially
strengthen the organization’s defense against common attack vectors and
significantly improve its overall cybersecurity resilience. Continued
vigilance, proactive security measures, and regular technical
assessments are essential for maintaining a strong security posture in
the evolving threat landscape.</p>
