<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This document presents a detailed cybersecurity posture assessment
for Oasis Wellness. The objective of this assessment is to identify
existing vulnerabilities, evaluate the effectiveness of current security
controls, and provide actionable recommendations to mitigate identified
risks. The analysis integrates data from organizational self-assessment,
external network scanning, and pre-existing risk registers to offer a
holistic view of the client’s security landscape.</p>

<h3 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-questionnaire-findings">Analysis
of Questionnaire Findings</h3>
<p>The review of security controls highlights a significant gap: the
lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. Email
remains a primary vector for phishing attacks and account compromise.
Without MFA, compromised credentials can lead to unauthorized access to
sensitive communications and potential lateral movement within the
organization. While MFA is implemented for computer logins and sensitive
data systems, extending this critical control to email is paramount. The
organization demonstrates good practices in security awareness training
and acceptable use policies, which form a strong foundation.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on the client’s infrastructure to
identify open ports, services, and their versions. The scan targeted
<code>172.16.50.20</code>.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="network-scan-findings">Network Scan
Findings</h2>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="scan-details">Scan Details</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP:</strong> <code>172.16.50.20</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> 2026-01-26</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="open-ports-and-services">Open Ports and
Services</h3>
<p>The following open port and associated service were identified:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port <code>3306</code>/open</strong> (<code>mysql</code>
- MySQL <code>5.7.33</code>)</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of
Technical Findings</h3>
<p>The network scan revealed an open MySQL database service on port
3306. MySQL version 5.7.33, while not critically old, is part of a
series that has reached End of Life (EOL) for many major distributors,
meaning it no longer receives security updates. Exposing a database
service directly to the network without strict firewall rules, VPN, or
other access controls poses a significant security risk. Databases often
contain sensitive information, and an accessible service can be a target
for brute-force attacks, SQL injection attempts, or exploitation of
known vulnerabilities if not properly patched and secured.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section consolidates the findings from the security control
review and technical scan, correlating them with existing risk data to
provide a comprehensive risk assessment.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="identified-risks-and-vulnerabilities">Identified Risks and
Vulnerabilities</h2>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="summary-of-gaps-and-findings">Summary of Gaps
and Findings</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Email Access:</strong> Without MFA, email
accounts are highly susceptible to credential stuffing and phishing
attacks, increasing the risk of account compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Exposed MySQL Database (Port 3306):</strong> An open
database port significantly broadens the attack surface for adversaries,
potentially leading to unauthorized data access, manipulation, or denial
of service. The MySQL version 5.7.33, while not ancient, is approaching
or past EOL for many environments, increasing its vulnerability
profile.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="pre-existing-and-correlated-risks">Pre-existing and Correlated
Risks</h3>
<p>The following pre-existing risk directly correlates with the
technical findings from the network scan:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align: left;"><strong>Risk Name</strong></th>
<th style="text-align: left;"><strong>Overview</strong></th>
<th style="text-align: center;"><strong>Severity (CVSS)</strong></th>
</tr>

<td style="text-align: left;">MySQL port 3306 is open to the
network.</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">7.5</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This existing risk, with a CVSS score of 7.5 (High), is confirmed by
the technical scan. The combination of an exposed database service and
its potential version status poses a critical threat to data
confidentiality, integrity, and availability.</p>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and enhance the overall
cybersecurity posture of Oasis Wellness, the following actionable
recommendations are provided.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="actionable-recommendations">Actionable
Recommendations</h2>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="immediate-actions-high-priority">Immediate
Actions (High Priority)</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Access:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Enable and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication for all user
accounts accessing email services. This significantly reduces the risk
of account compromise due to stolen or phished credentials.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide clear instructions and support to employees during the
MFA rollout.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Secure MySQL Port 3306:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Immediately implement strict firewall rules to restrict access to
port 3306 only from trusted internal IP addresses or secure VPN
connections. It should not be open directly to the internet.</p></li>
<li><p>Review and update MySQL user accounts and permissions, ensuring
the principle of least privilege is applied.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement strong password policies for all database
accounts.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="mid-term-actions">Mid-term Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Patch and Update MySQL:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Assess the current MySQL version (5.7.33) against vendor support
timelines and known vulnerabilities. Plan for an upgrade to a currently
supported version (e.g., MySQL 8.0) to ensure ongoing security updates
and patches.</p></li>
<li><p>Before upgrading, ensure proper backups are in place and test the
upgrade process in a non-production environment.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Vulnerability Scanning:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement a schedule for regular internal and external
vulnerability scans to proactively identify new exposures or
misconfigurations.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Employee Security Awareness Reinforcement:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>While security awareness training is conducted, reinforce
training specifically on identifying phishing attempts, the importance
of MFA, and proper handling of sensitive data.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Oasis Wellness demonstrates a foundational commitment to
cybersecurity through policies and training, as well as the
implementation of MFA for critical internal systems. However, the
identified gaps in MFA for email and the exposed MySQL database
represent significant vulnerabilities that could be exploited by
malicious actors. Addressing these critical issues through the
recommended immediate and mid-term actions will substantially improve
the organization’s defensive posture, reduce its attack surface, and
protect sensitive data assets. Continued vigilance and proactive
security measures are essential for maintaining a resilient
cybersecurity posture in an evolving threat landscape.</p>
