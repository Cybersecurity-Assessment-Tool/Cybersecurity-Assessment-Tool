<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of Aeon Pharmaceuticals
based on a review of organizational data, security questionnaire
responses, an external network scan, and existing risk documentation.
The assessment reveals a mixed security posture. Aeon Pharmaceuticals
has commendably implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email,
computer logins, and access to sensitive data systems, indicating a
strong foundation in identity and access management.</p>
<p>However, critical gaps were identified concerning foundational
security policies and continuous employee training. Specifically, the
organization lacks a formal employee acceptable use policy and does not
conduct annual security awareness training for all employees.</p>
<p>Most concerning is a significant discrepancy revealed by the
technical scan: an active, open port 8080 on the target exposing a
system titled "TOP SECRET DB". This finding directly contradicts a
pre-existing internal risk assessment that classified this port as
secure and a false positive with a CVSS score of 0.0. This critical
vulnerability represents an immediate and severe risk of data exposure
and unauthorized access, requiring urgent investigation and
remediation.</p>

</ul>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of
Technical Findings:</h3>
<p>The discovery of an open port 8080 is notable, especially with the
accompanying ‘http-title‘ script output of "TOP SECRET DB". This
strongly suggests that a highly sensitive database or system is directly
accessible through this port. The descriptive title itself indicates the
critical nature of the information potentially residing on this system.
The exposure of such a system, particularly if accessible from external
networks, constitutes a severe security vulnerability.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis and correlation of the provided data, the
following key risks have been identified:</p>

<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Exposed Sensitive Database (Port
8080)</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">A live network scan detected an open port
8080 on , revealing a system identified as "TOP SECRET DB". This
directly contradicts a pre-existing internal risk assessment (Risk ID:
Port 8080 Secured) which had classified this port as secure and a false
positive with 0.0 CVSS. The live finding indicates a critical oversight
or an out-of-date assessment. Exposure of such a system represents an
extreme risk of data breach and unauthorized access.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use
Policy</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The organization lacks a formal Acceptable
Use Policy (AUP) for employees. This absence means there are no clear
guidelines for the appropriate use of company assets, information
systems, and network resources, increasing the risk of misuse, data
leakage, and non-compliance.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">High</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Insufficient Annual Security
Awareness Training</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">While new employees receive security
awareness training, annual training for all employees is not
consistently conducted. This leaves the organization vulnerable to
evolving threats, as employee knowledge and best practices may become
outdated, increasing the risk of successful phishing attacks, social
engineering, and other human-factor vulnerabilities.</td>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and strengthen Aeon Pharmaceuticals’
cybersecurity posture, the following recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Investigation and Remediation for Port 8080
Exposure:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Verify Criticality:</strong> Immediately verify the
nature, contents, and criticality of the system accessible via port 8080
on .</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Restrict Access:</strong> Implement immediate
network-level restrictions (e.g., firewall rules) to prevent any
unauthorized or external access to port 8080. If internal access is
required, ensure it is limited to specific IP addresses or user groups
and requires strong authentication.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Update Risk Register:</strong> Update the internal risk
register to accurately reflect the true severity of this exposure,
superseding the previous "false positive" assessment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Security Audit:</strong> Conduct a comprehensive security
audit and penetration test specifically targeting this system to
identify all potential vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Secure Configuration:</strong> Ensure the system is
securely configured, patched, and has robust access controls.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Policy Development:</strong> Draft and formally implement
a comprehensive Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) for all employees.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Clear Guidelines:</strong> The AUP should clearly outline
expectations for responsible use of company IT resources, including data
handling, internet usage, email etiquette, and software installation
policies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Communication and Acknowledgment:</strong> Communicate
the AUP to all employees, ensure they understand its contents, and
obtain signed acknowledgements to confirm their understanding and
agreement to comply.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish a Mandatory Annual Security Awareness Training
Program:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Annual Training Cycle:</strong> Implement a mandatory
annual security awareness training program for all employees, not just
new hires.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Comprehensive Content:</strong> Training should cover
current threat landscapes, common attack vectors (e.g., phishing, social
engineering, ransomware), data protection best practices, strong
password hygiene, and the organization’s specific security policies
(including the newly developed AUP).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tracking and Refreshers:</strong> Track employee
completion rates and provide refresher courses or targeted training as
needed based on emerging threats or identified gaps.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>These recommendations, if implemented diligently, will significantly
enhance Aeon Pharmaceuticals’ overall cybersecurity posture and reduce
exposure to critical risks.</p>
