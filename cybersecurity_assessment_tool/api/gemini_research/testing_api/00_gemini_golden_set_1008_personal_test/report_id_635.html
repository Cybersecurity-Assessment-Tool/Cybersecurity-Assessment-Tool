<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the current cybersecurity posture of
<strong>Solid State</strong> based on a review of organizational data, a
security questionnaire, a network scan, and pre-existing risk
information. While the organization demonstrates some foundational
controls such as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and
initial security awareness training for new employees, significant gaps
were identified. These critical deficiencies include the lack of MFA for
computer logins and sensitive data systems, the absence of an employee
acceptable use policy, and insufficient annual security awareness
training for all staff. The network scan also identified an open port 22
(commonly SSH) on the internal target <code>127.0.0.1</code>, which,
coupled with an existing "Localhost Exposed" risk, highlights a need for
enhanced system hardening and access control. Addressing the outlined
recommendations is crucial for bolstering the overall security posture
and reducing potential attack vectors.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="identified-gaps-and-new-risks">Identified
Gaps and New Risks</h2>
<p>The analysis of the questionnaire and technical scan reveals several
areas of high risk:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins (High Risk):</strong> Not
requiring MFA for access to employee computers significantly elevates
the risk of unauthorized access. Compromised credentials (e.g., from
phishing) could grant an attacker direct access to internal systems.
(Correlates with Q2)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems (High
Risk):</strong> The absence of MFA on systems containing sensitive data
makes these critical assets highly vulnerable to credential stuffing
attacks or exploitation following credential theft, potentially leading
to severe data breaches. (Correlates with Q3)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (Medium
Risk):</strong> Without a formal Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), employees
may engage in activities that inadvertently expose the organization to
security risks, legal liabilities, or compliance violations due to a
lack of clear guidelines. (Correlates with Q4)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training (Medium
Risk):</strong> While new employees receive initial training, the lack
of mandatory annual security awareness training for all staff means the
workforce may not be kept up-to-date on evolving cyber threats (e.g.,
advanced phishing techniques, social engineering), increasing
human-factor risk. (Correlates with Q6)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open SSH Port on Localhost (Medium Risk):</strong> The
presence of an open port 22 on <code>127.0.0.1</code> (localhost)
indicates a running SSH service. Although it’s a loopback address, this
service itself, especially if misconfigured or running vulnerable
software versions (not ascertainable from current scan), represents a
potential attack surface. This finding directly validates the
pre-existing "Localhost Exposed" risk.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actionable recommendations are provided to mitigate the
identified risks and significantly improve Solid State’s overall
cybersecurity posture.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="immediate-actions">Immediate Actions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Logins:</strong> Immediately
deploy and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication for all employee logins
to company computers and endpoints. Prioritize this for all
users.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> Extend
MFA requirements to all systems, applications, and databases that store,
process, or transmit sensitive organizational or customer data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Secure Open SSH Port (Port 22 on
<code>127.0.0.1</code>):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Review Necessity:</strong> Confirm if SSH access is truly
required on the localhost. If not, disable the service.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Authentication Hardening:</strong> Ensure strong, unique,
and complex passphrases or, preferably, key-based authentication is
exclusively used. Disable password-based authentication if
possible.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Access Restriction:</strong> If the service must remain
active, restrict access to only necessary users or processes via
host-based firewalls (e.g., <code>iptables</code>) or SSH daemon
configuration.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Software Updates:</strong> Ensure the SSH server is
running the latest stable version to address known
vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Logging and Monitoring:</strong> Implement robust logging
for SSH access attempts and integrate logs into a Security Information
and Event Management (SIEM) system for real-time monitoring and alert
generation.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="strategic-enhancements">Strategic
Enhancements</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a formal AUP that clearly defines appropriate
employee conduct regarding the use of IT resources, internet access,
email, and handling of organizational data. Ensure all employees review,
understand, and acknowledge the policy annually.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mandate Annual Security Awareness Training:</strong>
Establish a comprehensive program for mandatory annual security
awareness training for <em>all</em> employees. Content should be current
and cover topics such as phishing, social engineering, malware,
ransomware, secure browsing, data handling, and incident
reporting.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Vulnerability Scanning and Penetration
Testing:</strong> Institute a schedule for regular internal and external
vulnerability scans to identify and address newly emerging technical
risks. Consider periodic penetration testing to simulate real-world
attacks and validate security controls.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Solid State demonstrates a foundational commitment to cybersecurity
through certain existing controls. However, critical gaps exist
concerning Multi-Factor Authentication for internal access,
comprehensive policy enforcement, and continuous security education.
Proactive and timely implementation of the recommended security controls
and practices will significantly enhance the organization’s resilience
against evolving cyber threats, protect valuable assets, and strengthen
its overall security posture.</p>
