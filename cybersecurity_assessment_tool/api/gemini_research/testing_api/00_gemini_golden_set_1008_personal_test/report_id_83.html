<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment for Ember Glow Hospitality, conducted by analyzing network
scan data, reviewing organizational security practices, and correlating
with existing risk information. The assessment identified several
critical gaps, most notably the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) for email access and computer logins, which represent high-risk
vulnerabilities. Additionally, an existing "Localhost Exposed" risk with
a CVSS score of 10.0 was confirmed by technical scans, indicating a
critical internal security concern. While basic security awareness
training is in place, the lack of an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)
presents a governance gap. Immediate recommendations focus on
implementing MFA, thoroughly investigating and remediating the localhost
exposure, and establishing foundational security policies. Addressing
these key areas will significantly enhance the organization’s overall
cybersecurity posture.</p>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This report presents a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for Ember Glow Hospitality. The evaluation process involved three
primary data inputs: a network scan (Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON),
organizational security questionnaire responses (Input_2_Org_Data_JSON),
and a list of current vulnerabilities (Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON). The
objective is to provide a synthesized view of the current security
landscape, identify critical vulnerabilities and control gaps, and offer
actionable recommendations for improvement.</p>

<h2 id="key-questionnaire-gaps">Key Questionnaire Gaps</h2>
<p>The following control deficiencies were identified based on the "No"
responses:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Email Access:</strong> This is a critical
security gap. Email accounts are frequent targets for phishing and
business email compromise (BEC) attacks. Without MFA, a single
compromised password can grant an attacker full access, leading to data
breaches and further network infiltration.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Computer Login:</strong> Similar to
email, the absence of MFA for computer logins significantly increases
the risk of unauthorized access to endpoints. Stolen or weak credentials
can allow attackers direct access to internal systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong>
A lack of a formal AUP means employees may not have clear guidelines
regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources. This can lead to
increased risks of data leakage, malware infections from prohibited
websites, and other security incidents due to unintentional
misuse.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An Nmap scan was performed on the specified target to identify open

</div>
<h2 id="detailed-risk-analysis">Detailed Risk Analysis</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Localhost Exposed (<code>127.0.0.1</code>):</strong> The
Nmap scan confirmed an open port 22 on <code>127.0.0.1</code>, directly
correlating with the "Localhost Exposed" risk previously identified with
a CVSS score of 10.0. This indicates a critical vulnerability within the
system itself. Although localhost services are not directly
Internet-facing, they can be exploited by an attacker who has already
gained an initial foothold, potentially leading to privilege escalation
or lateral movement. Immediate investigation into the service running on
port 22 and its security context is paramount.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>MFA Gaps:</strong> The absence of Multi-Factor
Authentication for both email access and computer logins are two of the
most severe security findings. Weak or compromised credentials are a
leading cause of data breaches. Without MFA, Ember Glow Hospitality is
significantly more susceptible to attacks like phishing, brute-forcing,
and credential stuffing, which can lead to widespread system compromise
and data loss.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> The lack of a
formal AUP creates ambiguity regarding expected employee behavior
concerning IT resources. This gap can lead to increased risks from
insider threats (both malicious and unintentional), compliance
violations, and a general lack of control over the security posture
resulting from user actions.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the comprehensive assessment, the following recommendations
are provided to enhance Ember Glow Hospitality’s cybersecurity posture,
categorized by urgency and impact.</p>
<h2 id="immediate-actions-criticalhigh-risks">Immediate Actions
(Critical/High Risks)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Access:</strong> Urgently deploy
and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication for all organizational email
accounts. This should be a top priority to protect against credential
theft and phishing attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Login:</strong> Roll out and
enforce MFA for all user and administrative logins to company computers
and servers. This is crucial for protecting endpoints from unauthorized
access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Investigate and Remediate "Localhost Exposed"
Risk:</strong> Immediately investigate the service running on port 22 of
<code>127.0.0.1</code>. Determine if this service is necessary, properly
configured, and securely hardened. If it is not required, disable or
remove it. If essential, ensure it is configured with the principle of
least privilege and robust authentication. Given the CVSS 10.0 rating,
this requires urgent attention.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mid-term-actions-medium-risks">Mid-Term Actions (Medium
Risks)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a comprehensive AUP that clearly outlines
employee responsibilities for using company IT resources. Ensure all
employees read, understand, and formally acknowledge this policy.
Integrate it into employee onboarding and annual reviews.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enhance Security Awareness Training:</strong> While
current training exists, tailor future security awareness campaigns to
specifically address the identified gaps, such as the importance of MFA,
recognizing phishing attempts, and adherence to the new AUP.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="long-term-strategy">Long-Term Strategy</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Regular Vulnerability Scanning and Penetration
Testing:</strong> Establish a program for regular internal and external
vulnerability scanning and periodic penetration testing to proactively
identify and address security weaknesses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Robust Patch Management Program:</strong> Implement an
automated and consistent patch management process for all operating
systems, applications, and network devices to minimize vulnerabilities
from outdated software.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Incident Response Plan Development and Testing:</strong>
Develop a comprehensive incident response plan and conduct regular
drills and tabletop exercises to ensure the organization can effectively
detect, respond to, and recover from security incidents.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Ember Glow Hospitality demonstrates a foundational commitment to
security awareness training. However, the assessment reveals critical
vulnerabilities, particularly concerning the lack of Multi-Factor
Authentication for email and computer access, and the high-severity
"Localhost Exposed" risk. The absence of an Acceptable Use Policy
further indicates a need for enhanced governance. By prioritizing and
implementing the recommended actions, Ember Glow Hospitality can
significantly strengthen its cybersecurity posture, reduce its attack
surface, and build a more resilient defense against evolving cyber
threats.</p>
