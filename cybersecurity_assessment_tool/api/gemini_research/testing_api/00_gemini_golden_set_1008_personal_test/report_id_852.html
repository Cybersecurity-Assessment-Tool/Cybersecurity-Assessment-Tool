<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>This report provides a cybersecurity posture assessment for Stellar
Pathways, analyzing organizational data and security control
implementations. Due to limitations in the provided network scan data
(<code>Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON</code>) and existing risk information
(<code>Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON</code>), the technical analysis of
network services and pre-existing vulnerabilities is incomplete.</p>
<p>The assessment identifies strong foundational controls, particularly
the widespread adoption of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). However,
critical gaps exist in fundamental security practices, specifically the
absence of an Employee Acceptable Use Policy and dedicated security
awareness training for new employees. These areas represent significant
risks that require immediate attention to strengthen the organization’s
overall security posture.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-questionnaire-gaps">Analysis of
Questionnaire Gaps</h2>
<p>Stellar Pathways has commendably implemented Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) across critical access points (email, computers,
sensitive data systems), which significantly enhances protection against
unauthorized access. The commitment to annual security awareness
training for all employees is also a positive step.</p>
<p>However, two significant security gaps were identified:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong>
The absence of a formal AUP means employees may lack clear guidelines
regarding the appropriate use of company IT resources, data handling,
and internet usage. This can lead to increased risks of misuse,
unintentional data leakage, and compliance violations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong> While existing employees receive annual training,
the lack of initial security awareness training for new hires leaves
them vulnerable during a critical onboarding period. New employees are
often prime targets for social engineering attempts and may
inadvertently introduce risks without proper early education on security
best practices.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was intended for the organization’s external
IP address, <code>106.221.70.109</code>. However, the provided
<code>Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON</code> data was malformed and
incomplete. Consequently, a comprehensive technical analysis of open
ports, services, product versions, and potential network-based
vulnerabilities cannot be performed or included in this report.</p>

unavailable</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Identified Products &amp; Versions:</strong> Data

</ul>
<p>Without this crucial technical data, it is not possible to assess
external attack surface, identify outdated software, misconfigurations,
or exposed services that could present exploitable vulnerabilities.</p>
<h1 id="existing-risk-assessment">Existing Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>The provided <code>Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON</code> data was broken
and incomplete. As a result, no pre-existing vulnerabilities or risks
from prior assessments could be incorporated into this report for
correlation or further analysis.</p>
<h1 id="risk-summary">Risk Summary</h1>
<p>Based on the available information, the primary identified risks for
Stellar Pathways stem from deficiencies in organizational policies and
employee training programs.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following recommendations are provided to address the identified
gaps and enhance the overall cybersecurity posture of Stellar Pathways.
These are categorized into immediate actions and future considerations
that depend on the availability of technical data.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="immediate-actions">Immediate Actions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create a comprehensive AUP that clearly defines employee
responsibilities regarding the use of all IT assets, including
computers, networks, internet access, email, and data handling
procedures.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure the AUP covers topics such as prohibited activities, data
classification, privacy expectations, and incident reporting.</p></li>
<li><p>Formally disseminate the AUP to all current employees, requiring
a signed acknowledgment of understanding and compliance. Integrate AUP
review and acknowledgment into the annual training cycle.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Mandatory Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Integrate a dedicated security awareness training module into the
onboarding process for all new hires.</p></li>
<li><p>This training should cover essential topics such as recognizing
phishing and social engineering attempts, strong password practices,
data protection principles, clean desk policy, and the procedure for
reporting suspicious activities or incidents.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure this initial training is distinct from, but complementary
to, the annual security awareness training for all employees.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="future-considerations-contingent-on-technical-data-availability">Future
Considerations (Contingent on Technical Data Availability)</h2>
<p>Once comprehensive network scan data and existing vulnerability
assessments become available, the following general best practices
should be investigated and implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Regular Vulnerability Scanning and Penetration
Testing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Systematically review scan results to identify and prioritize
patching and remediation of all identified vulnerabilities, especially
those related to outdated software, unpatched systems, and misconfigured
services.</p></li>
<li><p>Establish a recurring schedule for internal and external
vulnerability scans and periodic penetration tests to proactively
identify and address weaknesses in the network and
applications.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Review Network Configuration and Firewall
Rules:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Scrutinize all open ports on the external IP address to ensure
they are strictly necessary for business operations. Close any
unnecessary ports.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure that all exposed services are securely configured,
utilizing strong encryption (e.g., TLS 1.2+), strong authentication
mechanisms, and minimal privileges.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement robust firewall rules to restrict access to internal
resources from external networks to only authorized and necessary
traffic.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Robust Asset Management and Patch Management
Policies:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Maintain an accurate and up-to-date inventory of all IT assets,
including hardware, software, operating systems, and their respective
versions.</p></li>
<li><p>Establish and enforce a strict patch management policy to ensure
that all systems, applications, and network devices are regularly
updated with the latest security patches and firmware.</p></li>
</ul></li>
