<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of Sterling Silver,
based on a security questionnaire review, technical network scanning,
and an analysis of existing risk data. The organization demonstrates
strong foundational controls with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
widely implemented for critical systems and an Acceptable Use Policy in
place.</p>
<p>However, two critical gaps have been identified concerning security
awareness training: there is no formal training for new employees, nor
is there annual refresher training for all personnel. These omissions
significantly increase the human element risk within the organization.
Furthermore, the analysis revealed exposed Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
services on internal network assets (<code>10.10.10.51</code>), aligning
with a pre-existing critical risk regarding RDP exposure
(<code>10.10.10.50</code>). The presence of RDP directly accessible,
especially on internal networks, represents a high-severity
vulnerability that could be exploited for unauthorized access and
lateral movement if not properly secured and restricted. Immediate
action is recommended to mitigate these critical findings.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-security-controls">Analysis of
Security Controls</h2>
<p>The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to access control
by widely implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across email,
computer logins, and sensitive data systems. The presence of an employee
acceptable use policy is also a positive indicator for establishing
behavioral guidelines.</p>
<p>However, two significant weaknesses were identified:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of New Employee Security Awareness
Training:</strong> New employees are not receiving essential security
awareness training, which is crucial for integrating them into a secure
work culture and educating them on common threats.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Annual Security Awareness Training:</strong> The
absence of annual security awareness training means that existing
employees may not be updated on evolving threats, new policies, or
refreshed on best practices, leading to potential complacency and
increased susceptibility to social engineering attacks.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These training gaps represent critical vulnerabilities as the human
element is often the weakest link in the security chain.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>

</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="technical-analysis">Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>The primary technical finding is the exposure of the Remote Desktop
Protocol (RDP) service on port 3389/tcp on the internal host
<code>10.10.10.51</code>. RDP, while a legitimate administrative tool,
is a frequent target for attackers due to its common use and potential
for weak configurations (e.g., weak passwords, lack of MFA, direct
internet exposure). Even on an internal network, an exposed RDP service
can facilitate lateral movement and privilege escalation if an attacker
gains initial access to the network.</p>

</div>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="risk-correlation">Risk Correlation</h2>
<p>The finding of an exposed RDP service on <code>10.10.10.51</code>
directly correlates with the pre-existing critical risk concerning "RDP
Exposure" on <code>10.10.10.50</code>. This indicates a systemic issue
or common configuration pattern where RDP is accessible on multiple
internal hosts, potentially without sufficient protective measures. The
high CVSS score (9.0) associated with the existing RDP risk underscores
the critical nature of this vulnerability. Attackers frequently target
RDP for initial access or lateral movement, making its presence a severe
concern.</p>
<p>The identified gaps in security awareness training (for new employees
and annually for all employees) create an environment where the human
factor is more vulnerable. These gaps exacerbate technical risks, as
well-trained employees are the first line of defense against many
attacks, including those targeting exposed services like RDP via
credential phishing.</p>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and improve the overall cybersecurity
posture, the following recommendations are provided:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement Comprehensive Security Awareness
Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Establish a mandatory security awareness training program for all
new employees during their onboarding process. This should cover common
threats (e.g., phishing, malware), company policies, and best
practices.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement mandatory annual security awareness training for all
employees, ensuring content is updated to reflect current threat
landscapes and organizational policies.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider regular simulated phishing exercises to test employee
vigilance and reinforce training.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Secure Exposed RDP Services (10.10.10.51 and
10.10.10.50):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Disable if not needed:</strong> If RDP access to
<code>10.10.10.51</code> and <code>10.10.10.50</code> is not essential,
disable the service immediately.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Restrict Access:</strong> If RDP is required, restrict
access to specific, authorized IP addresses or internal networks via
firewall rules.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement VPN Gateway:</strong> Force all RDP connections
to originate from an internal VPN gateway, preventing direct access from
the network segment where it was discovered.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Strong Authentication:</strong> Ensure strong,
complex passwords are enforced, and consider enabling Network Level
Authentication (NLA) if not already active. Implement MFA for RDP where
feasible.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Patch and Update:</strong> Ensure the operating systems
and RDP services on <code>10.10.10.51</code> and
<code>10.10.10.50</code> are fully patched and up-to-date to mitigate
known vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Monitor:</strong> Implement logging and monitoring for
RDP login attempts (both successful and failed) to detect brute-force
attacks or unauthorized access attempts.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Network Segmentation Review:</strong> Review and
improve network segmentation to isolate critical assets and services,
limiting the blast radius of any potential compromise. This will help
contain lateral movement even if an RDP service is exploited.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Vulnerability Management Program:</strong> Ensure a
robust vulnerability management program is in place, including regular
scans and penetration testing, to proactively identify and address
similar exposures.</p></li>
