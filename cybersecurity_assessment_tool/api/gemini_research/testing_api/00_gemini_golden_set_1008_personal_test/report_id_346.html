<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>The current cybersecurity posture of Falcon Heavy requires immediate
attention, particularly in foundational areas of security awareness and
access controls. Significant gaps were identified in Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for email access, the absence of an employee
acceptable use policy, and a complete lack of security awareness
training for both new and existing employees. While no technical
vulnerabilities were identified from the provided network scan data (as
no specific scan results were supplied), these organizational policy and
training gaps present considerable internal risks that could lead to
successful phishing attacks, data breaches, and non-compliance issues.
Addressing these fundamental deficiencies is crucial for enhancing the
overall security resilience of the organization.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and enhance the overall
cybersecurity posture, the following recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Across the Organization:</strong>
Immediately enable and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all
organizational email accounts. This is a critical, foundational step to
protect against credential-based attacks such as phishing and
brute-force attempts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a comprehensive AUP that clearly outlines the
acceptable and prohibited use of organizational IT assets, data, and
networks. Ensure all employees read, understand, and formally
acknowledge this policy upon hiring and periodically
thereafter.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mandate Security Awareness Training for New
Hires:</strong> Integrate mandatory, comprehensive cybersecurity
awareness training as an essential part of the onboarding process for
all new employees. This training should cover phishing detection,
password hygiene, data handling, and reporting suspicious
activities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish a Recurring Annual Security Awareness Training
Program:</strong> Implement a mandatory, annual security awareness
training program for all employees. This program should be updated
regularly to reflect current threat landscapes and organizational
policies. Consider incorporating regular simulated phishing exercises to
test and reinforce learning.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Comprehensive Network Scans:</strong> Perform
detailed external and internal network vulnerability scans on all
designated target assets (e.g., <code>[Target IP]</code>, other relevant
infrastructure) to identify open ports, active services, software
versions, and potential technical vulnerabilities. This will provide a
more complete and accurate picture of the organization’s technical
attack surface.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These recommendations, when implemented, will significantly improve
Falcon Heavy’s defense against common cyber threats and strengthen its
overall security posture.</p>
