<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of Arcane Security,
based on a comprehensive analysis of organizational questionnaire
responses, a recent network vulnerability scan, and a review of existing
risk data. The organization demonstrates strengths in enforcing
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and sensitive data
access, maintaining an acceptable use policy, and conducting annual
security awareness training.</p>
<p>However, critical gaps were identified concerning the lack of MFA for
email access and the absence of security awareness training for new
employees, which present significant risks. A recent network scan
revealed no open ports on the internal target, specifically confirming
that Port 80 is closed. This finding directly mitigates a previously
identified risk regarding an unencrypted web server, suggesting the risk
register may require an update. Actionable recommendations are provided
to address all identified vulnerabilities and enhance the organization’s
overall security posture.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed using Nmap, targeting the internal IP
address .</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> <em>Not provided in source data. For
future scans, ensuring this metadata is captured is
crucial.</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Target IP:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> The target host was reported as
‘up‘.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports and Services:</strong> The scan identified no
open ports on the target host. Specifically, Port 80, a common port for
web services, was found to be ‘closed‘. No services, products, or
versions were identified due to the absence of open ports.</p></li>

<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section correlates findings from the security control review,
technical scans, and pre-existing risk data to provide a comprehensive
view of the organization’s current risk landscape.</p>
<h2
id="identified-critical-gaps-and-high-risks-from-questionnaire">Identified
Critical Gaps and High Risks (from Questionnaire)</h2>
<p>Based on the security control review, the following critical gaps and
high risks were identified:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Email Access (High Risk)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization currently does not
require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access. Email
accounts are primary targets for phishing and business email compromise
(BEC) attacks. Without MFA, a single compromised password can lead to
unauthorized access to sensitive communications, data, and potentially
enable an attacker to impersonate employees for fraudulent
activities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of Security Awareness Training for New Employees
(High Risk)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees are not receiving
specific security awareness training upon joining the organization. This
leaves them particularly vulnerable to social engineering tactics (e.g.,
phishing, vishing) and increases the likelihood of security policy
violations due to a lack of understanding of organizational security
best practices, threats, and incident reporting procedures.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="review-of-pre-existing-risks">Review of Pre-existing Risks</h2>
<p>The provided existing risk data included one vulnerability. Its
current status has been assessed against the latest technical scan
results.</p>
<div class="tabular">
<p><span>lp<span>0.4</span>lC</span> <strong>Risk Name</strong> &amp;
<strong>Overview</strong> &amp; <strong>Severity (CVSS)</strong> &amp;
<strong>Current Status</strong><br />
Unencrypted Web Server &amp; Port 80 is open. &amp; 5.0 (Medium)
&amp;<br />
</p>
</div>
<p><em>Note: While Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON identified an "Unencrypted
Web Server" risk with an overview stating "Port 80 is open", the recent
Nmap scan (Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON) for the target clearly indicates
that Port 80 is <strong>closed</strong>. Therefore, this specific
instance of the risk appears to be mitigated at the time of this
assessment, or the original risk information may have been based on
outdated data or a different system.</em></p>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actionable recommendations are provided to address the
identified critical gaps and enhance the overall cybersecurity posture
of Arcane Security.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email
Access:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Enable and mandate MFA for all employee
email accounts. This should be a top priority.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rationale:</strong> MFA significantly elevates the
security of email accounts by requiring a second verification factor in
addition to the password, making it substantially harder for
unauthorized users to gain access even if the password is
stolen.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> Critical</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop and integrate a comprehensive
security awareness training program into the onboarding process for all
new hires.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Early and consistent training ensures
that new employees are equipped with the knowledge to identify and
resist social engineering attacks and understand their role in
maintaining organizational security from their first day.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> High</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Verify and Update the Risk Register:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Conduct a thorough review of the
organization’s existing risk register to ensure all identified risks are
current, accurate, and reflect the actual technical state of systems.
Specifically, formalize the status update for the "Unencrypted Web
Server" risk based on the recent scan findings.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rationale:</strong> An accurate and up-to-date risk
register is fundamental for effective risk management, appropriate
resource allocation, and maintaining a clear understanding of the
organization’s threat landscape.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> Medium</p></li>
</ul></li>
