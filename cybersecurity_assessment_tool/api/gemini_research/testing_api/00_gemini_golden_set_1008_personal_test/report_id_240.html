<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a cybersecurity posture assessment for
<strong>Apex Legends Group</strong>, based on an organizational security
questionnaire, a review of existing risk data, and an attempted network
scan analysis. Our findings highlight several critical security gaps,
predominantly the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across
key access points (email, computer logins, sensitive data systems) and
insufficient annual security awareness training for all employees. While
comprehensive network scan data and existing vulnerability records were
unavailable for analysis, the identified policy and control deficiencies
present significant and immediate risks to the organization’s
information security. Addressing these foundational weaknesses is
crucial to enhance the overall security posture and resilience against
cyber threats.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>Based on the provided organizational data, the following details have
been extracted:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Organization Name:</strong> Apex Legends Group</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Email Domain:</strong>

<h1 id="security-control-review-questionnaire-analysis">Security Control
Review: Questionnaire Analysis</h1>
<p>A thorough review of the responses from the security questionnaire
reveals several critical omissions in fundamental security controls. The
pervasive lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email,
logging into computers, and accessing sensitive data systems is a major
vulnerability. This significantly elevates the risk of unauthorized
access in the event of credential compromise. Furthermore, the absence
of annual security awareness training for all employees indicates a gap
in fostering a security-conscious culture, leaving the organization more
susceptible to human-factor exploits such as phishing and social
engineering.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was part of the assessment scope; however, the
provided Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON data was malformed or incomplete,
preventing a comprehensive technical analysis of the network’s external
posture. Consequently, no specific open ports, running services, product
versions, or potential technical vulnerabilities could be identified or
evaluated from the scan input.</p>

<li><p><strong>Target IP/Hostname:</strong> <code>[Target IP]</code>
(Target information unavailable from broken scan data)</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="technical-findings">Technical Findings</h2>
<p>Due to the unavailability of valid network scan data, no technical
vulnerabilities or misconfigurations could be identified or reported
through this vector. For future assessments, it is critical to provide
accurate and complete scan data to enable a full technical
evaluation.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the available organizational data and security questionnaire
responses, several high-severity risks have been identified. These risks
primarily stem from the lack of foundational security controls which
could lead to significant compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and
availability.</p>
<h2 id="summary-of-identified-risks">Summary of Identified Risks</h2>
<p>The table below outlines the risks identified from the security
questionnaire analysis. Note that Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON was broken,
meaning no pre-existing organizational risks could be incorporated into
this assessment.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified security gaps and enhance the overall
cybersecurity posture of <strong>Apex Legends Group</strong>, the
following actionable recommendations are provided:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Across All
Critical Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Email Access:</strong> Prioritize and enforce MFA for all
email accounts, particularly for administrative staff, executives, and
anyone handling sensitive communications.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Computer Logins:</strong> Deploy MFA for all user
computer logins, especially for devices with access to sensitive systems
or corporate networks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> Mandate MFA for all
systems that store, process, or transmit sensitive organizational or
customer data.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Comprehensive Annual Security Awareness
Training for All Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and implement a mandatory, engaging, and comprehensive
annual security awareness training program for <u>all</u>
employees.</p></li>
<li><p>Training content should cover current threats such as
sophisticated phishing techniques, social engineering tactics, strong
password hygiene, data handling best practices, and incident reporting
procedures.</p></li>
<li><p>Regularly update training materials to reflect the latest threat
landscape and organizational policies.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Regular and Complete Network Vulnerability
Scans:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Establish a schedule for regular, authenticated vulnerability
scans of all internal and external network assets.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure that scan results are properly analyzed by qualified
personnel, and that identified vulnerabilities are prioritized and

assessments to enable a comprehensive technical evaluation.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Review and Update Security Policies
Regularly:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>While an acceptable use policy is in place, it is recommended to
regularly review and update all security policies (e.g., password
policy, data retention policy, incident response plan) to ensure they
align with current industry best practices and address emerging
threats.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Ensure Data Availability for Future
Assessments:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement procedures to ensure that all necessary data for
security assessments, including network scan results, existing risk
registers, and configuration details, are readily available and provided
in a complete and parseable format. This will facilitate more thorough
and accurate future evaluations.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The current cybersecurity posture of <strong>Apex Legends
Group</strong> exhibits significant vulnerabilities, primarily driven by
the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication across critical access points
and the lack of a comprehensive annual security awareness training
program for its entire workforce. Although a full technical assessment
was impeded by unavailable network scan data and existing risk records,
the identified control gaps present immediate and critical risks to the
organization. By diligently implementing the recommended actions,
particularly focusing on MFA deployment and robust security training,
<strong>Apex Legends Group</strong> can substantially strengthen its
defenses against common cyber threats and improve its overall
resilience.</p>
