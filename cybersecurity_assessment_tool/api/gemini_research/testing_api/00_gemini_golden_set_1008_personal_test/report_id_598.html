<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This document presents a cybersecurity assessment for <strong>Top
Tier</strong>. The assessment integrates data from a security
questionnaire, an external network scan, and an overview of pre-existing
organizational risks. The objective is to identify vulnerabilities,
assess risk exposure, and provide strategic recommendations for
improvement.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was intended to identify open ports, running
services, and potential vulnerabilities.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="scan-findings">Scan Findings</h2>
<p>The provided scan data did not contain any active scan results
(<code>scans</code> array was empty). Therefore, no open ports,
services, or technical vulnerabilities were identified through this
specific scan. It is recommended to ensure the target IP is correctly
configured and reachable for future scans to gain comprehensive insights
into external-facing assets. Regular and successful vulnerability
scanning is a critical component of a proactive security posture.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes findings from the questionnaire and
technical scans to present a consolidated view of the organization’s
risk posture.</p>
<h2 id="identified-risks">Identified Risks</h2>
<p>Based on the analysis of the security questionnaire, the following
risks have been identified due to gaps in security controls:</p>

<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of MFA for Computer Login</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The organization does not require
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to log into computers, increasing the
risk of unauthorized access to endpoints and internal networks if
credentials are stolen or guessed.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;">New employees do not receive security
awareness training, potentially leading to immediate susceptibility to
social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) or insecure practices,
before annual training can mitigate.</td>

<h2 id="pre-existing-vulnerabilities">Pre-existing Vulnerabilities</h2>
<p>The provided data regarding pre-existing vulnerabilities was empty.
This suggests either no documented vulnerabilities were available for
this report or the organization has no such record. It is crucial for
organizations to maintain a robust vulnerability management program to
continuously identify, assess, and remediate known vulnerabilities.</p>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actionable recommendations are provided to address the
identified risks and improve the overall cybersecurity posture of
<strong>Top Tier</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Access:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Mandate Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) for all user accounts accessing organizational email (e.g.,
Microsoft 365, Google Workspace).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Significantly reduces the risk of email
account compromise, even if passwords are stolen, by requiring a second
verification factor. This protects against phishing, credential
stuffing, and other forms of unauthorized access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> Critical</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Login:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Implement and enforce Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for all user logins to organizational computers,
workstations, and network resources.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Provides an additional layer of
security, protecting against unauthorized access to endpoints and
internal networks, which are common initial access points for
attackers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> Critical</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Introduce Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop and implement a mandatory
security awareness training program that is delivered to all new
employees during their onboarding process (e.g., within the first week
of employment).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Ensures that all personnel are aware of
common cyber threats, organizational security policies, and best
practices from day one, significantly reducing immediate human-factor
risks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> High</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Regular External Network Scans:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Schedule and perform regular (e.g.,
monthly or quarterly) external network vulnerability scans against all
external-facing IP addresses and domains associated with the
organization. Ensure the target IP for future scans is correctly
identified and reachable.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Proactively identifies open ports,
misconfigurations, and known vulnerabilities on internet-facing assets,
allowing for timely remediation before they can be exploited by
adversaries.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> Medium</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>This report highlights several key areas where <strong>Top
Tier</strong> can significantly enhance its cybersecurity defenses.
Prioritizing the implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
across critical access points (email and computer logins) and ensuring
immediate security awareness training for new hires will address the
most pressing risks identified. While no technical vulnerabilities were
found via the provided scan data, continuous monitoring, regular
vulnerability assessments, and ongoing employee education are essential
for maintaining a strong and resilient security posture against evolving
cyber threats.</p>
