<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of Wildfire
Communications based on provided organizational data, a security
questionnaire review, and network scan results. The assessment reveals
significant foundational security control gaps, particularly regarding
multi-factor authentication (MFA) implementation, the absence of an
employee acceptable use policy (AUP), and a complete lack of security
awareness training for employees. While the network scan on the
specified target ‘<code>[Target IP]</code>‘ yielded no active services
or open ports, indicating either a highly secured host or an
inconclusive scan, the policy and training deficiencies present critical
and immediate risks to the organization’s overall security. No
pre-existing vulnerabilities were provided for analysis in this
assessment. Addressing the identified policy and training gaps is
paramount to improving Wildfire Communications’ resilience against cyber
threats.</p>

<p>A review of the provided security questionnaire highlights several
critical areas where Wildfire Communications’ security controls are
deficient. These gaps significantly increase the organization’s attack
surface and risk exposure.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>The provided network scan data for target <code>[Target IP]</code>
was empty, indicating that no open ports or active services were
detected during the scan, or the scan itself did not yield any results.
Consequently, no technical vulnerabilities related to network services
could be identified from this specific dataset. A comprehensive
technical assessment would require successful scans against all relevant
network assets, including the external IP <code>224.201.139.99</code>,
to ensure all potential technical exposures are identified.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and enhance the overall
cybersecurity posture of Wildfire Communications, the following
recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Comprehensive Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mandate MFA for all user logins to company computers, laptops,
and any systems or applications that handle or store sensitive
organizational data.</p></li>
<li><p>Review and enforce MFA policies consistently across all critical
access points, including VPNs and cloud services.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create a clear, comprehensive, and legally sound AUP that defines
acceptable and unacceptable use of all company IT resources (networks,
devices, software, internet access, email).</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all employees read, understand, and formally acknowledge
the AUP upon hiring and annually thereafter. Integrate AUP adherence
into performance reviews.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish and Conduct Regular Security Awareness Training
Programs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement mandatory security awareness training for all new
employees as part of their onboarding process, covering fundamental
cyber hygiene practices.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct annual, mandatory security awareness training for all
employees, covering current threats such as phishing, social
engineering, ransomware, password management, data handling best
practices, and incident reporting procedures.</p></li>
<li><p>Use simulated phishing campaigns to test employee vigilance and
reinforce training concepts.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Comprehensive Technical Assessments:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Perform regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing
against all internal and external network assets, including the external
IP <code>224.201.139.99</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all publicly accessible services are identified, secured,
and regularly patched.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement a robust patch management program for all operating
systems and applications.</p></li>
