<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of Common Ground based
on a recent network scan, organizational security questionnaire
responses, and an inventory of existing risks. While the technical scan
of the target revealed a locked-down external attack surface with no
open ports, several critical organizational and policy-based security
gaps were identified through the questionnaire. These include a lack of
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access, the absence of an
Employee Acceptable Use Policy, and insufficient security awareness
training programs. Addressing these foundational policy and user-centric
issues is paramount to significantly enhance the organization’s overall
security posture.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was conducted on the target IP address . The scan
aimed to identify open ports, running services, and potential
vulnerabilities.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not provided in metadata.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Target Host:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Status:</strong> Host reported as
<code>up</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports and Services:</strong> The Nmap scan did not
identify any open ports on the target host . Specifically, port 80 was
identified as <code>closed</code>. This indicates a minimal direct
external attack surface from the scanned IP address. Without open ports,
no services, products, or versions could be enumerated for further
technical vulnerability analysis.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section correlates findings from the security control review,
technical scans, and pre-existing risk information to provide a
comprehensive risk assessment.</p>
<h2
id="identified-critical-gaps-and-high-risks-from-questionnaire">Identified
Critical Gaps and High Risks (from Questionnaire)</h2>
<p>Based on the security control review, the following critical gaps and
high risks were identified:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Email Access:</strong> Email is a primary
vector for phishing and compromise. The absence of MFA significantly
increases the risk of account takeover, leading to data breaches,
business email compromise (BEC), and unauthorized access to other linked
systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> An AUP provides guidelines for employees on the proper
use of company resources, data, and systems. Without one, there is an
increased risk of misuse, unauthorized actions, and a lack of legal
recourse for policy violations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inadequate Security Awareness Training (New
Employees):</strong> New employees are often targets for social
engineering. Lack of initial training leaves them vulnerable to common
attack techniques, potentially compromising the organization from day
one.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inadequate Security Awareness Training (Annual for All
Employees):</strong> Cyber threats evolve constantly. Without regular
training, employees may not be aware of new threats, compliance
requirements, or best practices, increasing the likelihood of human
error leading to security incidents.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="technical-findings-and-pre-existing-risks">Technical Findings
and Pre-existing Risks</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Minimal External Attack Surface:</strong> The technical
scan of found no open ports. This is a positive finding, indicating that
the specific host scanned is not directly exposing services to the
network that could be exploited.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pre-existing Risk Discrepancy (Unencrypted Web
Server):</strong> A pre-existing risk item was noted: "Unencrypted Web
Server" (Severity: 5.0, Overview: "Port 80 is open."). However, the
current scan on explicitly shows port 80 as <code>closed</code>. This
suggests either:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The pre-existing risk is outdated.</p></li>
<li><p>The pre-existing risk refers to a different system or IP address
not covered by this scan.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>While the immediate technical vulnerability (open port 80) is not
present on the scanned host, the general principle of ensuring all web
services use encryption (HTTPS/SSL/TLS) remains a critical security best
practice.</p></li>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and enhance the overall cybersecurity
posture, the following recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
Email:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Mandate MFA for all email accounts across the
organization.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
access due to stolen or weak passwords.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Create a comprehensive AUP outlining
expectations for employees regarding the use of company systems, data,
and internet access. Obtain signed acknowledgments from all
employees.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Provides clear guidelines, establishes a
baseline for acceptable behavior, and supports legal recourse if
policies are violated.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Comprehensive Security Awareness Training
Programs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action (New Employees):</em> Implement mandatory security
awareness training as part of the onboarding process for all new
hires.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Action (Annual Training):</em> Conduct mandatory annual
security awareness training for all employees, covering current threats,
phishing recognition, data handling, and company policies.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Educates employees on cybersecurity best
practices, reduces the likelihood of successful social engineering
attacks, and fosters a security-conscious culture.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Review and Clarify Pre-existing Risks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Investigate the "Unencrypted Web Server" risk
(Severity 5.0) to determine if it applies to other assets within the
organization. If a web server is indeed operational (or planned)
elsewhere, ensure it is configured to use HTTPS/SSL/TLS for all
traffic.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Ensures that risk inventory is accurate and
that appropriate security measures are in place for all active web
services.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Maintain Regular Security Scanning:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Continue periodic network scans and
vulnerability assessments to identify any new exposures or
misconfigurations as the network evolves.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Provides ongoing visibility into the external
attack surface and helps proactively identify potential
vulnerabilities.</p></li>
