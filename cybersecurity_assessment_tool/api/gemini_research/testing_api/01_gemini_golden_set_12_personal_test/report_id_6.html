<h1 id="executive-overview">Executive Overview</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity assessment for
<strong>FixedIt LLC</strong>, synthesizing data from a technical network
scan, a security controls questionnaire, and a review of pre-existing
risks. The analysis aims to provide a clear and actionable overview of
the organization’s current security posture.</p>
<p>The assessment reveals a positive and proactive security posture. The
organization attests to having strong administrative controls, including
universal Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and a robust security
awareness training program.</p>
<p>A key finding of this assessment is the successful remediation of a
previously identified risk. The prior risk, "Unencrypted Web Server,"
was associated with an open Port 80. The current technical scan confirms
that <strong>Port 80 is now closed</strong> on the target system
(<code>192.168.0.5</code>), effectively mitigating this vulnerability.
No other open ports or active services were discovered during the
scan.</p>
<p>While the current state is strong, security is an ongoing process.
Recommendations in this report focus on maintaining this robust posture
through continuous monitoring and formal documentation of remediated
risks.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following details were provided for the assessment. This
information forms the basis of the analysis and defines the scope of the
review.</p>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>The following table summarizes the organization’s self-reported
status of key administrative and technical security controls. A response
of "Yes" () indicates the control is in place, while "No" () would
indicate a potential gap.</p>

<p>The responses indicate a strong foundation of security policies and
controls. The consistent implementation of MFA across critical systems
significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access via compromised
credentials. The established security awareness program is crucial for
defending against social engineering and phishing attacks. No gaps were
identified from this questionnaire.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-1">Analysis</h2>
<p>The technical scan found no open ports on the target system. The fact
that port 80 (HTTP) is explicitly reported as closed is a significant
finding, as it directly contradicts a previously known risk. This
indicates that proactive steps have been taken to secure the network
perimeter. The absence of open ports drastically reduces the external
attack surface.</p>
<h1 id="correlated-risk-assessment">Correlated Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes findings from all data sources to provide a
holistic view of the organization’s risk landscape. The status of a

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis, the organization’s security posture is strong.
The following recommendations are focused on maintaining and formalizing
this high standard of security.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Formalize Risk Management Updates</strong><br />
<em>Priority: High</em><br />
The "Unencrypted Web Server" risk has been successfully mitigated. It is
crucial to formally update the internal risk register to reflect this
change. This ensures that documentation accurately represents the
current security posture and that resources are not wasted tracking a
resolved issue.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Continuous Monitoring</strong><br />
<em>Priority: Medium</em><br />
To maintain the secure state of the network perimeter, establish a
regular, automated scanning schedule (e.g., weekly or monthly). This
practice will provide early warnings if new services are exposed or if
configurations change, allowing for rapid response before they can be
exploited.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Maintain and Review Security Controls</strong><br />
<em>Priority: Medium</em><br />
The strong administrative controls (MFA, training) are a cornerstone of
the organization’s defense. Continue to enforce these policies
rigorously. Conduct an annual review of these controls to ensure they
remain effective and aligned with evolving threats and business
needs.</p></li>
