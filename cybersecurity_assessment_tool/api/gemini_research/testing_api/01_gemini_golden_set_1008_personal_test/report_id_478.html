<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment conducted for <strong>Prism Logic</strong>. The assessment
incorporated an analysis of organizational security controls via a
questionnaire, a technical network scan of the designated external
asset, and a review of pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The primary and most critical finding is the systemic lack of
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across the organization. MFA is not
enforced for email, computer logins, or access to sensitive data
systems. This absence represents a significant security gap, as it
leaves the organization highly vulnerable to account takeover attacks
resulting from credential compromise. A single compromised password
could grant an attacker broad access to critical systems.</p>
<p>On a positive note, the organization has established foundational
security practices, including an employee acceptable use policy and a
consistent security awareness training program for all staff. These
controls are commendable and reduce the risk of insider threats and
social engineering.</p>
<p>The external network scan performed on the target IP address
<code>[Target IP]</code> did not identify any open ports or exposed
services. While this may indicate a strong firewall posture, it also
warrants verification to ensure the target was online and accessible
during the scan.</p>
<p>Our recommendations prioritize the immediate implementation of MFA
across all critical services to mitigate the most severe identified
risk. Further details on all findings and actionable remediation steps
are provided in the subsequent sections of this report.</p>

<h4 id="analysis">Analysis:</h4>
<p>The questionnaire reveals a critical weakness in the organization’s
identity and access management strategy. The consistent "No" answers
regarding Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) indicate that user accounts
are protected solely by passwords. This is a significant risk, as
password-based threats (e.g., phishing, credential stuffing, password
spraying) are among the most common and effective attack vectors.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was conducted to identify exposed services and
potential vulnerabilities on the organization’s external
infrastructure.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> 2026-01-31</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="findings">Findings:</h4>
<p>The network scan conducted on the target IP address did not identify
any open TCP or UDP ports. This outcome suggests one of the following
possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The host was offline or unreachable at the time of the
scan.</p></li>
<li><p>A robust firewall is in place that drops or rejects all
unsolicited incoming traffic, which is a positive security
practice.</p></li>
<li><p>There are no services publicly exposed from this specific IP
address.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>No vulnerabilities were identified from this scan.</p>

<p>The pre-existing risk register
(<code>Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON</code>) was empty, and no technical
vulnerabilities were discovered during the network scan. Therefore, the
risk listed above is the sole critical finding of this assessment.</p>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended to
improve the cybersecurity posture of <strong>Prism Logic</strong>.
Recommendations are prioritized by severity.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="priority-1-implement-multi-factor-authentication-critical">Priority
1: Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (Critical)</h2>
<p>This is the most urgent action required to protect the organization
from common cyberattacks.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Email Systems:</strong> Immediately enforce MFA for all
user access to the email system (e.g., Office 365, Google Workspace).
Email accounts are a primary target for attackers seeking to gain an
initial foothold.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Remote Access:</strong> Mandate MFA for all remote access
solutions, including VPNs and Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
gateways.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sensitive Systems:</strong> Develop and execute a phased
rollout plan to require MFA for all applications and systems that store
or process sensitive data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Computer Logins:</strong> Evaluate and deploy an MFA
solution for logging into company workstations and servers to protect
against unauthorized physical or remote access.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="priority-2-network-verification-and-monitoring-high">Priority 2:
Network Verification and Monitoring (High)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Confirm Scan Results:</strong> Internally verify that the
external firewall configuration for <code>[Target IP]</code> is
correctly configured to block all non-essential traffic. Ensure that the
asset was online during the assessment scan.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Continuous Scanning:</strong> Establish a
regular, automated vulnerability scanning schedule for all
external-facing assets to proactively identify and remediate new
vulnerabilities.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="priority-3-policy-enhancement-medium">Priority 3: Policy Enhancement
(Medium)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Update Acceptable Use Policy:</strong> Review and update
the existing Acceptable Use Policy to include clauses mandating the use
of MFA where it is implemented. Clearly define employee responsibilities
for protecting their accounts.</p></li>
