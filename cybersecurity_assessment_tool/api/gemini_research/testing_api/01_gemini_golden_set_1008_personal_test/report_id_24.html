<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides an assessment of the cybersecurity posture for
Bluebird Bio. The analysis is based on a review of organizational
security controls, a technical network scan, and pre-existing risk
data.</p>
<p>The assessment identified several critical and high-risk gaps in the
organization’s security controls. The most significant findings are the
complete lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer
logins, and access to sensitive data systems. This represents a
<strong>critical risk</strong> of unauthorized access and potential
account compromise.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the organization lacks a formal security awareness
training program for both new and existing employees. This is a
<strong>high-risk</strong> deficiency that increases susceptibility to
social engineering attacks, such as phishing.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the provided technical network scan data
and the list of current risks were corrupted and could not be analyzed.
This prevented a full evaluation of the external technical attack
surface and a correlation with known vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Immediate remediation is required to address the identified control
gaps. Recommendations focus on the rapid implementation of MFA and the
development of a comprehensive security awareness program. A rescan of
the external network is also a high-priority action item.</p>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A review of foundational security controls was conducted via a
questionnaire. The results highlight significant areas for improvement,
particularly in identity and access management and security awareness.
"No" answers indicate a gap in controls and are considered findings.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was scheduled to be performed against the
organization’s public-facing IP address (<code>[Target IP]</code>).
However, the scan data file provided for analysis was found to be
corrupted and unreadable.</p>
<p><strong>Status:</strong> Data Unavailable.</p>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong> Without this data, it is not possible to
assess the external technical attack surface. This includes identifying
open ports, running services, outdated software versions, and potential
vulnerabilities that could be exploited by an external attacker. This is
a significant blind spot in the current assessment.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> A new external network scan must be
conducted as soon as possible to gather the necessary technical
data.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes the findings from the security control

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified
risks and improve the overall security posture of Bluebird Bio.
Recommendations are prioritized based on risk severity.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>[Critical] Implement Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Deploy a robust MFA solution across the
entire organization.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority Targets:</strong> Prioritize enforcement on (1)
email access (e.g., Office 365, G Suite), (2) remote access VPNs, and
(3) all systems containing sensitive or regulated data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> This is the single most effective
control to prevent unauthorized access resulting from compromised
credentials.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>[High] Establish a Security Awareness Training
Program:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Procure and implement a security
awareness training platform.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Details:</strong> The program must include mandatory
training for all new hires during onboarding and annual refresher
training for all employees. It should cover key topics like phishing,
password security, and acceptable use. Regular phishing simulations
should be conducted to measure effectiveness.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> This builds a "human firewall"
and reduces the likelihood of security incidents caused by human
error.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>[Medium] Conduct External Network Vulnerability
Scan:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediately schedule and execute a new
authenticated and unauthenticated vulnerability scan of the external IP
address ().</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> To identify and remediate
technical vulnerabilities on internet-facing systems, closing a critical
gap in visibility.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>[Informational] Investigate Data Integrity
Issues:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Review the processes for generating and
transferring security data (scan results, risk logs) to ensure they are
reliable.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> To prevent future assessments
from being hindered by corrupted or missing data.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>While Bluebird Bio has some foundational policies in place, this
assessment reveals critical deficiencies in core security controls that
require immediate attention. The lack of Multi-Factor Authentication and
a formal security awareness program exposes the organization to
significant and preventable risks.</p>
<p>By implementing the prioritized recommendations outlined in this
report, Bluebird Bio can substantially improve its defensive
capabilities, reduce its attack surface, and build a more resilient
security posture.</p>
