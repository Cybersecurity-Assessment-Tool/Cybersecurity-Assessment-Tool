<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-overview">1. Executive
Overview</h1>
<p>This report provides a cybersecurity posture assessment for
<strong>Stone Arch Masonry</strong>. The analysis is based on a review
of organizational security controls via a questionnaire. Due to data
corruption issues with the provided network scan and existing risk logs,
this assessment focuses primarily on procedural and policy-based
controls.</p>
<p>The assessment reveals a mixed security posture. While the
organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
computer and sensitive data access, there are critical and high-risk
gaps in other fundamental areas. The most significant risks identified
are the lack of MFA for email, the absence of an employee acceptable use
policy, and a complete lack of security awareness training. These
deficiencies expose the organization to a high likelihood of business
email compromise, phishing attacks, and insider threats.</p>
<p>Immediate remediation is required to address these gaps.
Recommendations focus on implementing foundational security controls to
significantly reduce the organization’s attack surface and improve its
overall resilience against common cyber threats.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-control-gaps">Analysis of Control
Gaps</h2>
<p>The questionnaire reveals several critical control gaps:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>No MFA for Email:</strong> This is the most critical
finding. Email is the primary target for phishing and account takeover
attacks. Without MFA, a single compromised password can lead to a full
breach of an employee’s mailbox, enabling attackers to launch further
attacks, access sensitive data, and commit financial fraud.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> An AUP sets
clear expectations for employees on how to use company assets securely.
Its absence creates ambiguity and increases the risk of both
unintentional and malicious insider threats.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Security Awareness Training:</strong> The complete
lack of a training program means employees are likely unable to
recognize or properly respond to common threats like phishing. This
makes the organization highly vulnerable to social engineering.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">4. Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The provided network scan data for target
<code>[Target IP]</code> was corrupted and could not be parsed.
Therefore, no technical analysis of open ports, running services, or
potential software vulnerabilities could be performed as part of this
assessment.</p>
<p>A full external network scan is essential for identifying technical
vulnerabilities such as outdated software, misconfigured services, and
unnecessary open ports. The inability to perform this analysis
represents a significant blind spot in this assessment. A rescan is a
high-priority recommendation.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment">5. Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>The following table summarizes the key risks identified during this
assessment. The risks are derived from the Security Control Review, as
the pre-existing risk data was also unavailable due to data
corruption.</p>

<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Email Account
Compromise</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The lack of MFA on email accounts makes
them highly susceptible to takeover via password spraying or phishing.
This can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and
further internal network attacks.</td>

<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>High Susceptibility to
Phishing</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Without any security awareness training,
employees are ill-equipped to identify and report phishing attempts. A
successful phishing attack could result in credential theft, malware
infection, or ransomware.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Insider Threat &amp; Asset
Misuse</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The absence of an Acceptable Use Policy
means there are no formal rules governing the use of company IT assets.
This increases the risk of data leakage, unauthorized software
installation, and other insecure employee behaviors.</td>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">6. Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the findings of this assessment, the following actions are
recommended to mitigate the identified risks and improve the overall
security posture of <strong>Stone Arch Masonry</strong>.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="immediate-priority-0-30-days">Immediate
Priority (0-30 Days)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Enable MFA for All Email Accounts:</strong> This is the
single most effective action to mitigate the risk of email compromise.
Enforce MFA for all users immediately.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="high-priority-30-90-days">High Priority
(30-90 Days)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Conduct a New Network Scan:</strong> Commission a new,
successful external network vulnerability scan to identify and assess
technical vulnerabilities on the perimeter.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a formal AUP that all employees must read and
sign. This policy should clearly define the rules for using company
computers, networks, and data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish a Security Awareness Training Program:</strong>
Implement a mandatory training program for all employees. This should be
conducted upon hiring and repeated at least annually. The training must
cover key topics such as phishing, password security, and social
engineering.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="medium-priority-90-180-days">Medium Priority
(90-180 Days)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Restore Risk Management Data:</strong> Investigate the
cause of the data corruption for the existing risk log and restore it
from backups. A centralized risk register is a key component of a mature
security program.</p></li>
