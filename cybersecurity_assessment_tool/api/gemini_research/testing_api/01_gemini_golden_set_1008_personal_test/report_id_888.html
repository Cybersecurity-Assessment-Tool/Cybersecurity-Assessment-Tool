<h1 id="executive-overview">Executive Overview</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment for <strong>Sovereign Trust</strong>. The analysis is based
on a combination of organizational data, security control
questionnaires, and technical network scans.</p>
<p>The overall security posture reveals a solid foundation in employee
security awareness and endpoint/email access controls. The organization
has successfully implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email
and computer access, and maintains policies and training programs that
align with industry best practices.</p>
<p>However, a critical security gap was identified: the absence of
mandatory MFA for accessing sensitive data systems. This represents a
significant risk, as it exposes the organization’s most valuable data to
potential compromise via stolen or weak credentials.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the technical network scan data and the list of current
organizational risks were provided in a corrupted format. This prevented
a complete technical vulnerability analysis of the external perimeter
and a review of known, pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>Key recommendations focus on immediately addressing the MFA gap for
sensitive systems, re-initiating the technical network scan, and
providing a valid list of current risks for a more comprehensive future
assessment.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A review of the organization’s security controls was conducted via a
questionnaire. The responses are summarized below. A checkmark ()
indicates an affirmative response (control in place), while an X ()
indicates a negative response, highlighting a potential security
gap.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>The questionnaire results are largely positive, indicating a mature
approach to endpoint security and user awareness. However, the lack of
MFA for sensitive data systems is a critical oversight. This gap could
allow an attacker with compromised credentials to directly access and
exfiltrate the organization’s most critical assets, such as client data,
financial records, or intellectual property. This finding is classified
as a <strong>Critical Risk</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was intended to be performed against the
organization’s public-facing infrastructure to identify open ports,
running services, and potential vulnerabilities.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not Available</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Status:</strong> <strong>Failed - Corrupted
Data</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-1">Analysis</h2>
<p>The provided network scan data (Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON) was
corrupted and could not be parsed. As a result, no analysis of the
external technical posture could be performed. It is not possible at
this time to determine if outdated services, insecure configurations, or
known vulnerabilities exist on the network perimeter. A new scan is
required to complete this portion of the assessment.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes findings from all available data sources.
Due to corrupted inputs for the technical scan and pre-existing risks,
this assessment is primarily based on the Security Control Review.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended to
improve the cybersecurity posture of <strong>Sovereign Trust</strong>.
Recommendations are prioritized by severity.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Systems (Critical):</strong>
Immediately prioritize and deploy a mandatory MFA solution for all user
accounts (including administrative and service accounts) that have
access to sensitive data systems. This is the single most effective
control to mitigate the risk of unauthorized data access from
compromised credentials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct a New External Network Scan (High):</strong> A
new, comprehensive vulnerability scan of the external IP address
(<code>154.1.235.88</code>) and any other public-facing assets must be
conducted. The previous scan data was unusable. This action is essential
to identify and remediate technical vulnerabilities that could be
exploited by external attackers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Provide Current Risk Register (Medium):</strong> For
future assessments, ensure that a valid and up-to-date list of known
organizational risks is provided. A holistic security review requires
understanding both newly discovered and previously accepted
risks.</p></li>
