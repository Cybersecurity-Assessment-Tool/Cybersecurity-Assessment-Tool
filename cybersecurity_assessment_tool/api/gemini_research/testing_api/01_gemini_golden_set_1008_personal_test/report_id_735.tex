\section{Executive Summary}
% ==============================================================================

This report details the findings of a cybersecurity assessment conducted for \textbf{Nova Terra}. The analysis synthesizes data from an external network scan, a security controls questionnaire, and a review of pre-existing risk documentation.

The assessment identified several high-impact risks that require immediate attention. Key findings include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Confirmed Network Exposure:} The external network scan confirmed that a MySQL database service (port 3306) is publicly accessible from the internet. This aligns with a known risk and presents a significant threat of data breach.
    \item \textbf{Outdated Software:} The exposed MySQL service is running version 5.7.33, which reached its official End of Life (EOL) in October 2023. EOL software no longer receives security updates and is a prime target for attackers.
    \item \textbf{Critical Gaps in Identity and Access Management:} The organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email or for computer logins. This dramatically increases the risk of account compromise and unauthorized access.
    \item \textbf{Insufficient Security Awareness:} The lack of a formal security awareness training program for new and existing employees creates a significant human-layer vulnerability, making the organization more susceptible to phishing and social engineering attacks.
\end{itemize}

The overall security posture is considered high-risk due to these fundamental control gaps. This report provides specific, actionable recommendations to mitigate these findings and improve the organization's defensive capabilities.

\section{Organizational Information}

The following information was provided by the client and used as a baseline for this assessment.

\textbf{Attribute} & \textbf{Value} \\ \midrule
Organization Name & \textbf{Nova Terra} \\
Email Domain      & \texttt{NovaTerra.org} \\

\section{Security Control Review}
% ==============================================================================

A review of the organization's security controls was conducted via a questionnaire. The responses reveal critical gaps in fundamental security practices.

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{}p{0.6\linewidth}cp{0.25\linewidth}@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Control Question} & \textbf{Response} & \textbf{Analyst Notes} \\ \midrule
Do you require MFA to access email? & \no & \riskcritical{Critical Risk}. Email is a primary target for account takeover. \\
\addlinespace
Do you require MFA to log into computers? & \no & \riskcritical{Critical Risk}. Lack of MFA allows for easier lateral movement after a compromise. \\
\addlinespace
Do you require MFA to access sensitive data systems? & \yes & Positive control in place. \\
\addlinespace
Does your organization have an employee acceptable use policy? & \yes & Good governance practice. \\
\addlinespace
Does your organization do security awareness training for new employees? & \no & \riskhigh{High Risk}. New staff are not equipped to identify security threats. \\
\addlinespace
Does your organization do security awareness training for all employees at least once per year? & \no & \riskhigh{High Risk}. The human firewall is not being maintained. \\ \bottomrule

\section{Technical Scan Results}
% ==============================================================================

An external network scan was performed against the target IP address \texttt{172.16.50.20} to identify open ports and exposed services.

\subsection{Open Ports and Services}

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{}lllll@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Port} & \textbf{State} & \textbf{Service} & \textbf{Product} & \textbf{Version} \\ \midrule
3306/tcp & open & mysql & MySQL & 5.7.33 \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Scan Results for Target: \texttt{172.16.50.20}}
\end{table}

\subsection{Analysis of Findings}
The scan confirms that a MySQL database server is directly exposed to the network. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Service Exposure:} Port 3306 is the default port for MySQL. Exposing this service directly to the internet is highly discouraged as it allows attackers to perform brute-force attacks, exploit vulnerabilities, or attempt to exfiltrate data.
    \item \textbf{Outdated Version:} The identified version, MySQL 5.7.33, has reached its End of Life (EOL). This means the vendor no longer provides security patches for newly discovered vulnerabilities, leaving the server permanently at risk.
\end{itemize}

\section{Consolidated Risk Assessment}
% ==============================================================================

The following table synthesizes findings from all data sources into a consolidated list of organizational risks.

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{}p{0.25\linewidth}p{0.15\linewidth}p{0.5\linewidth}@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Risk Name} & \textbf{Severity} & \textbf{Description} \\ \midrule
\textbf{Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication} & \riskcritical{Critical} & The absence of MFA for email and computer logins exposes the organization to a high likelihood of account compromise, leading to data breaches and ransomware. \\
\addlinespace
\textbf{Public Database Exposure} & \riskhigh{High (7.5)} & A MySQL database is directly accessible from the network, allowing attackers to target it for data theft, modification, or denial of service. This was confirmed by the network scan. \\
\addlinespace
\textbf{End-of-Life Software in Use} & \riskhigh{High} & The exposed MySQL server is running an unsupported, EOL version (5.7.33). It is vulnerable to known exploits that will not be patched by the vendor. \\
\addlinespace
\textbf{Insufficient Security Awareness Training} & \riskhigh{High} & Without regular training, employees are more likely to fall victim to phishing, malware, and social engineering attacks, turning them into an entry point for intruders. \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}

\section{Recommendations}
% ==============================================================================

The following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified risks and strengthen the organization's security posture.

\subsection{Immediate Priority (0-30 Days)}
\begin{description}
    \item[Remediate Database Exposure:] Immediately implement strict firewall rules to restrict all access to port 3306. Access should only be permitted from specific, trusted IP addresses. For remote administration, a Virtual Private Network (VPN) should be required.
\end{description}

\subsection{High Priority (30-90 Days)}
\begin{description}
    \item[Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):] Procure and deploy an MFA solution across the organization. Prioritize enforcement on the following systems:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Email (e.g., Office 365, Google Workspace)
        \item All remote access solutions (VPNs)
        \item Workstation/computer logins
        \item All administrative accounts
    \end{itemize}
    \item[Upgrade End-of-Life Software:] Plan and execute the upgrade of the MySQL 5.7.33 database to a currently supported version (e.g., MySQL 8.x). This will ensure the system receives critical security patches. Test applications for compatibility before upgrading the production environment.
    \item[Establish Security Awareness Training:] Implement a formal security awareness training program. All new hires must complete the training as part of their onboarding. All existing employees must complete the training annually. This program should cover phishing, password security, and acceptable use policies.
