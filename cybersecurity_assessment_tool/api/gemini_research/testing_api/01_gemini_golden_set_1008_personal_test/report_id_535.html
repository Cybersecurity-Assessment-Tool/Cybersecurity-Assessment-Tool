<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment for <strong>True North Travel</strong>. The analysis is based
on a combination of an external network scan, a review of existing
risks, and an organizational security controls questionnaire.</p>
<p>The assessment reveals a <strong>critical risk posture</strong>. Key
findings indicate a complete absence of fundamental security controls,
including Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all systems and any
form of employee security awareness training. These deficiencies create
a high probability of security incidents, such as account compromise
through phishing or credential stuffing attacks.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the technical scan identified an exposed Secure Shell
(SSH) service on the network perimeter. When combined with the lack of
MFA and user training, this exposed service presents an immediate and
significant threat to the organization’s infrastructure.</p>
<p>Urgent and decisive action is required to remediate these critical
vulnerabilities. Recommendations are provided in this report to
establish a baseline of security and mitigate the most severe risks.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following information was provided for the assessment.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Organization Name:</strong> True North Travel</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Email Domain:</strong>
<code>TrueNorthTravel.com</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Primary External IP:</strong>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A security questionnaire was completed to evaluate the implementation
of essential administrative and technical controls. The results,
detailed in Table <a href="#tab:controls" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="tab:controls">1</a>, highlight critical gaps in the
organization’s security framework. Each "No" response represents a
significant deviation from industry best practices.</p>

</table>
</div>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The universal "No" responses indicate a
foundational weakness in the security program. The lack of MFA is the
most severe issue, as it removes a critical layer of defense against
account takeovers. The absence of security training and policies leaves
the organization highly vulnerable to human-error-based attacks like
phishing and social engineering.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed against the target IP address
<code>2001:db8::1</code>. The scan identified the following open
port.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The scan confirms that port 22, the
standard port for SSH, is open to the public internet. SSH is a critical
administrative protocol, and its direct exposure increases the network’s
attack surface. This service is a common target for automated
brute-force attacks, where threat actors attempt to guess credentials.
Given the lack of MFA, a successful password guess could lead to a
complete system compromise.</p>
<h1 id="consolidated-risk-assessment">Consolidated Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>The following table synthesizes findings from the security control
review, technical scan, and pre-existing risk data. Since no
pre-existing vulnerabilities were reported, all risks listed below are
new findings from this assessment.</p>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actions are recommended to address the identified
risks. They are prioritized based on severity and potential impact.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Priority 1 (RISK-001): Implement MFA
Immediately</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p><br />
Deploy Multi-Factor Authentication across all systems, with the highest
priority on:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Email accounts (e.g., Office 365, Google Workspace).</p></li>
<li><p>All remote access systems, including VPNs and the exposed SSH
service.</p></li>
<li><p>Access to systems containing sensitive or critical data.</p></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Priority 2 (RISK-002): Establish a Security Awareness
Program</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p><br />
Immediately develop and deploy a security awareness training program
that includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mandatory training for all new hires during onboarding.</p></li>
<li><p>Annual mandatory training for all employees covering topics like
phishing, password security, and data handling.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider periodic phishing simulations to test and reinforce
training.</p></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Priority 3 (RISK-003): Secure the SSH Service</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p><br />
Reduce the attack surface of the exposed SSH service by implementing the
following controls:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If possible, place the service behind a VPN and disable public
access.</p></li>
<li><p>If public access is required, use a firewall to restrict access
to only known, trusted IP addresses.</p></li>
<li><p>Disable password-based authentication and enforce the use of
strong SSH keys.</p></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Priority 4 (RISK-004): Develop an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP)</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p><br />
Create a formal AUP that clearly outlines the rules and responsibilities
for all employees when using company IT assets. Ensure the policy is
distributed to all staff and that they provide written acknowledgment of
its receipt and understanding.</p>
