<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a cybersecurity posture assessment for
<strong>Fable &amp; Lore</strong>, based on organizational data provided
on 2026-01-31. The analysis reveals critical security gaps that expose
the organization to significant risk. While foundational controls like
an acceptable use policy and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email
are in place, there are severe deficiencies in other areas.</p>
<p>Key findings indicate a complete lack of MFA for computer logins and
access to sensitive data systems. Furthermore, no security awareness
training is conducted for new or existing employees. These gaps create a
high susceptibility to credential theft, phishing, and social
engineering attacks.</p>
<p>Compounding these issues, the provided technical network scan data
and the list of current risks were corrupted and could not be analyzed.
This prevents a full evaluation of the organization’s technical
vulnerabilities. Urgent remediation is required to address the
identified control failures and to conduct a successful technical
assessment.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">3. Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>The network scan data for the target IP address
(<code>[Target IP]</code>) was found to be corrupted or incomplete.
<strong>As a result, no technical analysis of open ports, running
services, or potential software vulnerabilities could be
performed.</strong></p>
<p>A comprehensive external vulnerability scan is a critical component
of any security assessment. Without this data, the organization has no
visibility into potential misconfigurations or unpatched software that
could be exploited by an external attacker. It is imperative that a new
scan be conducted immediately.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="pre-existing-risk-data-review">4.
Pre-existing Risk Data Review</h1>
<p>The data file containing current organizational risks and known
vulnerabilities was also found to be broken or unavailable. Therefore, a
review and correlation of pre-existing risks against new findings could
not be completed. A complete and up-to-date risk register is essential
for tracking and managing an organization’s security posture over
time.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment-summary">5. Risk Assessment
Summary</h1>
<p>The following risks have been identified based on the available data.
The inability to analyze technical scan results and pre-existing
vulnerabilities means the overall risk posture is likely more severe
than what is documented here.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">6. Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified
risks and improve the overall security posture of <strong>Fable &amp;
Lore</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Comprehensive MFA (Critical):</strong>
Immediately deploy and enforce MFA for all employee computer logins and
for access to all systems containing sensitive or critical business
data. This is the single most effective control to mitigate the risk of
credential theft.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish a Security Awareness Program (High):</strong>
Develop and implement a mandatory security awareness training program.
This program must be required for all new hires during onboarding and
include annual refresher training for all staff. Topics should cover
phishing, password security, and acceptable use.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct a New Network Vulnerability Scan
(Urgent):</strong> Execute a new, comprehensive external vulnerability
scan against the public IP address (<code>135.196.38.14</code>) and any
other public-facing assets. All identified vulnerabilities should be
triaged and remediated based on severity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Provide a Complete Risk Register (Urgent):</strong> For a
full assessment, provide the complete and current risk register or list
of known vulnerabilities. If one does not exist, the organization should
begin a formal risk assessment process to identify, analyze, and track
security risks.</p></li>
