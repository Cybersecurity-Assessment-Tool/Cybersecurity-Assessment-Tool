<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity assessment
conducted for <strong>Harbor Light Foundation</strong>. The assessment
combined a review of organizational security controls via a
questionnaire, an external network scan, and an analysis of pre-existing
risks.</p>
<p>The primary finding of this assessment is the presence of
<strong>critical gaps in identity and access management
controls</strong>, specifically the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) across all critical systems. Additionally, significant
administrative weaknesses were identified, including the absence of a
formal employee acceptable use policy and a security awareness program
for new hires.</p>
<p>From a technical network perspective, the scanned target at
<code>192.168.1.100</code> demonstrated a strong security posture, with
no open ports detected. While this is a positive finding, it does not
mitigate the severe risks posed by the administrative and
identity-related control deficiencies. An attacker could bypass network
defenses entirely by compromising user credentials.</p>
<p>Immediate remediation efforts should focus on implementing MFA,
developing foundational security policies, and enhancing the security
awareness training program.</p>

<p>A review of administrative and technical security controls was
conducted based on a questionnaire. The results are summarized in the

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-control-gaps">Analysis of Control
Gaps</h2>
<p>The questionnaire revealed five significant control gaps:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA:</strong> The absence of MFA for email,
computer logins, and sensitive data access is a critical vulnerability.
This significantly increases the risk of account takeover via phishing
or credential stuffing attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Missing Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> Without an
AUP, there are no formal guidelines for employees regarding the secure
use of company assets. This can lead to inconsistent security practices
and unintentional data exposure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Onboarding Security Training:</strong> New employees
are often a primary target for social engineering. Failing to provide
security training during onboarding leaves the organization vulnerable
from day one of an employee’s tenure.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed to identify open ports and services on
the specified target system.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP:</strong> <code>192.168.1.100</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> 2026-01-31</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Status:</strong> Host is up.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="findings">Findings</h2>
<p>The scan determined that the host was responsive but reported
<strong>zero open TCP ports</strong>. All 1000 scanned ports were in a
’closed’ state.</p>
<h4 id="interpretation">Interpretation:</h4>
<p>This is a positive security finding. It indicates that the target
system is either not running any network services or is protected by a
well-configured firewall that blocks all unsolicited inbound
connections. This configuration significantly reduces the external
attack surface of the device.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment-summary">Risk Assessment Summary</h1>
<p>This section correlates the findings from the security control review
and technical scan to provide a summary of the key risks facing the
organization. No pre-existing vulnerabilities were provided for this
assessment.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the identified risks, the following prioritized actions are
recommended to improve the cybersecurity posture of <strong>Harbor Light
Foundation</strong>.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="immediate-actions-critical-risk">Immediate
Actions (Critical Risk)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediately enable and enforce MFA for
all users across all systems, prioritizing email, remote access
solutions (VPN), and access to sensitive data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> This is the single most effective
control to prevent unauthorized access resulting from compromised
credentials.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="near-term-actions-high-risks">Near-Term
Actions (High Risks)</h2>
<ol start="2">
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Draft a formal AUP that clearly defines
the rules and expectations for employees when using company-owned IT
assets, networks, and data. Require all employees to read and
acknowledge the policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> An AUP establishes a baseline for
secure behavior, reduces ambiguity, and provides a framework for
enforcing security standards.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Enhance the Security Awareness Training
Program:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop a mandatory security awareness
training module for all new employees to be completed as part of their
onboarding process. This should cover key topics like phishing, password
hygiene, and the new AUP.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> Training new hires immediately
reduces their susceptibility to common attacks and instills a
security-conscious mindset from the beginning of their
employment.</p></li>
