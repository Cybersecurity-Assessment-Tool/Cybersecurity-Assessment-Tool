<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for <strong>Nebula Creative</strong>. The analysis is based on a
synthesis of technical network scanning, a review of organizational
security controls via a questionnaire, and an evaluation of pre-existing
risk data.</p>
<p>The assessment reveals a mixed security posture. On the technical
front, the scanned host at <code>192.168.1.100</code> demonstrates a
strong defensive configuration, with no open ports detected. This
indicates a well-hardened perimeter for that specific asset, minimizing
its external attack surface.</p>
<p>However, the organizational security control review identified two
significant gaps that present a high level of risk to the
organization:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Critical Risk: Lack of Endpoint Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA).</strong> The absence of mandatory MFA for computer
logins exposes the organization to significant threats from credential
theft and unauthorized access. * <strong>High Risk: Inadequate Security
Awareness Training.</strong> The lack of annual, recurring security
training for all employees increases susceptibility to phishing, social
engineering, and other human-centric attacks.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>While no pre-existing vulnerabilities were reported and the network
scan was positive, these procedural and policy-based gaps must be
addressed urgently. Recommendations are provided in this report to
mitigate these risks and strengthen the overall security posture of
<strong>Nebula Creative</strong>.</p>

areas requiring improvement. A "No" response indicates a deviation from
security best practices and represents a potential risk.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed to identify open ports and exposed
services on the target system.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>192.168.1.100</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> Up</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Summary:</strong> The scan confirmed that the host
is online and responsive. However, no open TCP ports were discovered
within the scanned range. All tested ports were found to be in a
’closed’ state.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> This is a positive security finding. A
host with no open ports presents a minimal attack surface to the
network, suggesting it is either not running network-facing services or
is protected by a well-configured firewall that denies all unsolicited
incoming connections.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified
risks and improve the overall security posture.</p>
<h2 id="endpoint-multi-factor-authentication-critical">Endpoint
Multi-Factor Authentication (Critical)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Implement and enforce a mandatory
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) policy for all employee and contractor
computer logins.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> This control acts as a critical
barrier against unauthorized access resulting from stolen or weak
credentials. Even if an attacker obtains a user’s password, they will be
unable to log in without the second factor (e.g., an authenticator app,
hardware token, or biometric scan).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tools:</strong> Consider solutions integrated with your
operating system (e.g., Windows Hello for Business) or third-party
endpoint security solutions (e.g., Duo, Okta).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="annual-security-awareness-training-high">Annual Security
Awareness Training (High)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Establish a formal, mandatory security
awareness training program that all employees must complete at least
once per year.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> The threat landscape is
constantly changing. Annual training ensures that all staff members are
kept up-to-date on the latest threats, such as new phishing techniques,
and are reminded of their responsibilities under the organization’s
security policies. This builds a strong human firewall.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implementation:</strong> The program should cover topics
such as phishing identification, password hygiene, acceptable use, and
incident reporting. Consider incorporating simulated phishing campaigns
to test and reinforce the training.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The security assessment of <strong>Nebula Creative</strong> indicates
a strong network perimeter for the scanned asset but reveals critical
gaps in internal security controls. The lack of MFA on endpoints and the
absence of annual security training for all staff are significant
vulnerabilities that substantially increase organizational risk.</p>
<p>By implementing the recommendations outlined in this report,
<strong>Nebula Creative</strong> can effectively mitigate these risks,
reduce its attack surface, and foster a more resilient security culture.
Prioritizing these initiatives is essential for protecting company data
and systems against modern cyber threats.</p>
