<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for <strong>Mainframe Managed</strong>, conducted on 2026-01-31. The
analysis synthesizes data from a network perimeter scan, a security
controls questionnaire, and a review of pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The assessment identified several critical and high-risk security
gaps related to organizational policies and access controls. While the
organization has implemented foundational security measures, such as MFA
for email and an acceptable use policy, significant weaknesses exist.
The most pressing concerns are the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) for computer logins and access to sensitive data systems.
Furthermore, the absence of mandatory annual security awareness training
for all employees exposes the organization to a heightened risk of
social engineering and phishing attacks.</p>
<p>The external network scan of the target IP address
<code>[Target IP]</code> did not detect any open ports. This is a
positive indicator of a strong firewall configuration but should be
verified with internal and authenticated scans to ensure the host was
online and the scan was not blocked.</p>
<p>Immediate remediation should focus on implementing a comprehensive
MFA strategy and establishing a recurring security awareness training
program to mitigate the most significant threats to the organization’s
data and systems.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-controls">Analysis of Controls</h2>
<p>The questionnaire reveals critical gaps in the organization’s access
control and security training programs. The absence of MFA on computers
and sensitive systems dramatically increases the risk of unauthorized
access should an employee’s credentials be compromised. Additionally,
the lack of annual security training for all staff means that employees
may not be equipped to recognize and respond to evolving cyber
threats.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed to identify exposed services
and potential vulnerabilities on the organization’s public-facing
infrastructure.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> 2026-01-31</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Summary:</strong> No open ports were
detected.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="interpretation">Interpretation</h2>
<p>The scan results indicate that the target host at
<code>[Target IP]</code> did not have any discoverable TCP or UDP ports
open to the internet at the time of the scan. This is a positive
security finding, as it suggests a properly configured firewall is in
place, limiting the external attack surface.</p>
<p>However, this result could also be due to the host being offline or
ICMP (ping) requests being blocked, preventing the scanner from
confirming the host was active. Further authenticated internal testing
is recommended to validate this finding.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section correlates findings from the security control review,
technical scan, and any pre-existing risks. The following new risks were
identified during this assessment. No pre-existing vulnerabilities were
provided for review.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the identified risks, the following actions are recommended
to improve the cybersecurity posture of <strong>Mainframe
Managed</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="critical-priority">Critical Priority</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Systems
(RISK-001):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediately deploy a robust Multi-Factor
Authentication solution for all systems containing sensitive or critical
data. This includes databases, financial applications, and
administrative portals.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> This is the most effective single
control to prevent unauthorized access to critical assets in the event
of a credential compromise.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="high-priority">High Priority</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Enforce MFA on All Endpoints (RISK-002):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Roll out mandatory MFA for all employee
computer logins. Solutions compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux
operating systems are widely available (e.g., Duo, Okta, Microsoft
Authenticator).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> Securing endpoints with MFA
prevents attackers from easily moving laterally within the network after
obtaining a user’s password.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Annual Security Awareness Training
(RISK-003):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop and implement a mandatory
security awareness training program for all employees, to be completed
annually. The program should include modules on phishing, password
security, social engineering, and acceptable use.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> A well-trained workforce is a
critical layer of defense. Regular training ensures that security
remains a top-of-mind concern and that employees are prepared to face
modern threats.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="general-recommendations">General Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Internal Vulnerability Scanning:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Schedule regular, authenticated
vulnerability scans of the internal network.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> An internal scan can validate the
findings of the external scan and uncover misconfigurations or
vulnerabilities that are not visible from the internet.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The assessment of <strong>Mainframe Managed</strong> reveals a mixed
cybersecurity posture. While the organization demonstrates a commitment
to security through its hardened network perimeter and foundational
policies, critical deficiencies in access control and employee training
present a significant risk. The identified vulnerabilities, particularly
the lack of comprehensive MFA, could be exploited by threat actors to
gain unauthorized access to sensitive data and systems.</p>
<p>We strongly urge the organization to prioritize the implementation of
the recommendations outlined in this report, starting with the
deployment of MFA on sensitive systems and endpoints. By addressing
these gaps, <strong>Mainframe Managed</strong> can substantially reduce
its risk exposure and build a more resilient security foundation.</p>
