% --- EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW ---
\section{Executive Overview}
This report provides a cybersecurity posture assessment for \textbf{Binary Star}, based on an analysis of organizational security controls, technical network scan data, and pre-existing risk information. 

The primary findings indicate several \sevcolor{critical}{critical deficiencies} in fundamental security controls. The lack of mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer access represents a significant and immediate threat to the organization. These gaps expose the organization to a high risk of business email compromise, ransomware attacks, and unauthorized data access. Furthermore, the absence of a consistent security awareness training program leaves the organization vulnerable to phishing and social engineering attacks.

It is critical to note that the provided technical network scan data (\texttt{Input\_1\_Network\_Scan\_JSON}) and the list of current risks (\texttt{Input\_3\_Current\_Risks\_JSON}) were corrupted and could not be analyzed. This report is therefore based solely on the organizational questionnaire. A new technical scan is urgently required to gain a complete picture of the organization's security posture.

Immediate remediation of the identified control gaps is strongly recommended to reduce the risk of a significant security incident.

% --- ORGANIZATIONAL INFORMATION ---
\section{Organizational Information}
The following details were provided for the assessment.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Organization Name:} Binary Star
    \item \textbf{Email Domain:} \texttt{BinaryStar.org}
    \item \textbf{Website Domain:} \href{http://www.BinaryStar.org}{\texttt{www.BinaryStar.org}}
    \item \textbf{External IP Address:} \texttt{27.150.178.129}
\end{itemize}

% --- SECURITY CONTROL REVIEW ---
\section{Security Control Review}
The following table summarizes the organization's responses to the security controls questionnaire. Each "No" response indicates a potential gap in the defensive posture.

\begin{table}[h!]

\caption{Security Controls Questionnaire Analysis}
\begin{tabular}{p{8cm} c l}
\toprule
\textbf{Control Question} & \textbf{Response} & \textbf{Assessment} \\
\midrule
Do you require MFA to access email? & \no & \sevcolor{critical}{Critical Gap} \\
Do you require MFA to log into computers? & \no & \sevcolor{critical}{Critical Gap} \\
Do you require MFA to access sensitive data systems? & \yes & Meets Best Practice \\
Does your organization have an employee acceptable use policy? & \yes & Meets Best Practice \\
Does your organization do security awareness training for new employees? & \no & \sevcolor{high}{High Risk} \\
Does your organization do security awareness training for all employees at least once per year? & \no & \sevcolor{high}{High Risk} \\

% --- TECHNICAL SCAN RESULTS ---
\section{Technical Scan Results}
\subsection{Data Integrity Issue}
The provided network scan data file, \texttt{Input\_1\_Network\_Scan\_JSON}, was found to be corrupted or incomplete. As a result, no analysis of open ports, running services, or potential software vulnerabilities on the target IP address (\texttt{27.150.178.129}) could be performed.

\subsection{Implications}
Without valid scan data, the organization has no visibility into its external technical attack surface. Vulnerabilities such as unpatched software, insecure service configurations, or exposed management interfaces may exist and are currently untracked.

\subsection{Recommendation}
It is imperative to conduct a new, comprehensive, and authenticated vulnerability scan of the organization's external and internal networks as soon as possible.

% --- RISK ASSESSMENT ---
\section{Risk Assessment}
This assessment is based on the findings from the Security Control Review. The severity of each risk is rated based on its potential impact on the organization's confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The list of pre-existing risks was unavailable due to a corrupted data file (\texttt{Input\_3\_Current\_Risks\_JSON}).

\begin{table}[h!]

\caption{Identified Risks Summary}
\begin{tabular}{p{1.5cm} p{3.5cm} p{6.5cm} l}
\toprule
\textbf{Risk ID} & \textbf{Risk Name} & \textbf{Description} & \textbf{Severity} \\
\midrule
RISK-001 & Lack of MFA on Email & The absence of MFA on email accounts makes them highly susceptible to takeover via phishing or credential stuffing. This can lead to business email compromise (BEC), data breaches, and further internal compromise. & \sevcolor{critical}{Critical} \\
\addlinespace
RISK-002 & Lack of MFA on Workstations & Stolen credentials can be used to directly access employee computers, granting an attacker an initial foothold within the internal network to launch further attacks like ransomware. & \sevcolor{critical}{Critical} \\
\addlinespace
RISK-003 & Inadequate Security Awareness Training & Without regular training, employees are less likely to recognize and report phishing attempts, malware, or other social engineering tactics, making them a primary vector for initial compromise. & \sevcolor{high}{High} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

% --- RECOMMENDATIONS ---
\section{Recommendations}
The following prioritized recommendations are provided to address the identified risks and improve the overall security posture of \textbf{Binary Star}.

\subsection{Immediate Priority (Critical Risks)}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Enforce MFA for Email Access:} Immediately deploy and mandate the use of Multi-Factor Authentication for all user access to the email system. This is the single most effective control to prevent unauthorized account access and business email compromise.
    \item \textbf{Enforce MFA for Computer Logins:} Implement MFA for all workstation and server logins. This measure significantly hardens the internal network against attackers who have compromised user credentials.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{High Priority}
\begin{enumerate}
    \setcounter{enumi}{2} % Continue numbering
    \item \textbf{Establish a Security Awareness Training Program:} Develop and implement a formal, mandatory security awareness training program. This program should be required for all new hires and conducted annually for all staff. Key topics must include phishing identification, password security, and the acceptable use policy.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Process Improvement}
\begin{enumerate}
    \setcounter{enumi}{3}
    \item \textbf{Conduct a New Network Vulnerability Scan:} Schedule and execute a comprehensive external network vulnerability scan against the public IP address (\texttt{27.150.178.129}) and any other external assets. This will identify technical vulnerabilities that are currently unknown.
    \item \textbf{Maintain a Formal Risk Register:} Ensure that known risks and vulnerabilities are tracked in a formal risk register. The data intended for this assessment (\texttt{Input\_3\_Current\_Risks\_JSON}) was unavailable; a reliable system must be in place to track and manage risks going forward.
\end{enumerate}
