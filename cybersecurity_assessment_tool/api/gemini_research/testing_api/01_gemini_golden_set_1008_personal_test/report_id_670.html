<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for <strong>Iron Oak Furniture</strong>. The analysis is based on a
review of organizational security controls, an external network scan,
and pre-existing risk data.</p>
<p>The assessment reveals a mixed security posture. The organization has
implemented foundational controls such as Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) for email and computer access. However, critical gaps were
identified that significantly increase the risk of a security incident.
These include the lack of MFA for sensitive data systems, the absence of
an employee Acceptable Use Policy, and no requirement for annual
security awareness training for all staff.</p>
<p>The external network scan against the target IP address yielded no
open ports, which may indicate a strong firewall configuration or a
potential scanning issue. No pre-existing vulnerabilities were
reported.</p>
<p>Immediate action is recommended to address the identified policy and
access control deficiencies to mitigate risks related to data breaches
and unauthorized access.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A review of the organization’s security controls was conducted via a
questionnaire. The responses are summarized below. Items marked with a
red ’X’ () represent significant gaps in the security framework and are
discussed in the Risk Assessment section.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network vulnerability scan was performed to identify open
ports and services exposed to the internet.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> 2026-01-31</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="summary-of-findings">Summary of Findings</h2>
<p>The scan completed successfully but did not identify any open TCP or
UDP ports on the target system. This outcome can indicate one of the
following scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The target host has a properly configured firewall that is
blocking all unsolicited incoming traffic, which is a positive security
practice.</p></li>
<li><p>The target host was offline or unreachable at the time of the
scan.</p></li>
<li><p>An Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) may have blocked the scan
traffic.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As no services were discovered, no service-specific vulnerabilities
could be identified from this scan.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section correlates the findings from the security control review
and technical scan. While no technical vulnerabilities were discovered,
significant procedural and policy-based risks were identified.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and improve the overall security
posture of <strong>Iron Oak Furniture</strong>, the following actions
are recommended with priority.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Comprehensive MFA (Priority:
Critical):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Immediately deploy a robust MFA solution across all systems and
applications that store, process, or transmit sensitive data.</p></li>
<li><p>Prioritize systems containing customer information, financial
records, and intellectual property.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure the MFA policy is enforced for all users, including
administrators and third-party contractors.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce an Acceptable Use Policy (Priority:
High):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create a formal AUP that clearly defines the rules and
responsibilities for all employees when using company networks, devices,
and data.</p></li>
<li><p>The policy should cover topics such as data handling, internet
usage, password security, and incident reporting.</p></li>
<li><p>Require all current and new employees to read and formally
acknowledge the policy.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish a Mandatory Annual Security Training Program
(Priority: High):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Institute a security awareness training program that is mandatory
for all employees on an annual basis.</p></li>
<li><p>The training should cover current threats, including phishing,
ransomware, social engineering, and best practices for data
protection.</p></li>
<li><p>Track completion to ensure 100% participation.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p><strong>Iron Oak Furniture</strong> has established a baseline of
security with its current MFA implementation for email and workstations.
However, the critical and high-risk findings identified in this report
expose the organization to significant threats, particularly concerning
the protection of its sensitive data.</p>
<p>By prioritizing the recommendations—implementing comprehensive MFA,
establishing a formal AUP, and mandating annual security training—the
organization can substantially reduce its risk exposure and build a more
resilient and mature security program.</p>
