<h1 id="executive-overview">Executive Overview</h1>
<p>This report provides a cybersecurity assessment for Radiant Life. The
analysis is primarily based on a review of organizational security
controls provided via a questionnaire. It is critical to note that the
technical network scan data (<code>Input_1</code>) and the pre-existing
risk data (<code>Input_3</code>) were found to be corrupted and could
not be processed for this report.</p>
<p>The primary findings from the available data reveal critical gaps in
fundamental security controls. The complete absence of Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) across email, workstations, and sensitive data
systems represents a <strong>Critical</strong> risk. An attacker with
compromised credentials could gain broad and unrestricted access to key
organizational assets.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the lack of foundational security policies, such as an
Acceptable Use Policy, and the absence of security training for new
employees, create a high-risk environment susceptible to human error and
insider threats. While annual training for existing employees is a
positive control, it is undermined by these other significant
deficiencies.</p>
<p>Immediate remediation efforts should focus on implementing MFA,
developing core security policies, and integrating security awareness
into the employee onboarding process. A new technical scan is strongly
recommended to identify and address potential software
vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>The following table summarizes the organization’s responses to the
security controls questionnaire. A red  indicates a negative response,
signifying a potential control gap and increased risk.</p>

</table>
<p>The review highlights five significant control gaps. The lack of MFA
is the most severe deficiency, as it is a foundational defense against
account compromise. The absence of an acceptable use policy and security
training for new hires points to an immature security program that has
not established basic cyber hygiene practices.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The data provided for the external network
scan (<code>Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON</code>) was corrupted and could
not be parsed.</p>
<p>Therefore, this report does not contain an analysis of open ports,
running services, or potential software vulnerabilities that would
typically be identified through such a scan. It is crucial to conduct a
new, successful scan to obtain this visibility into the organization’s
external attack surface.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This risk assessment is based on the findings from the Security
Control Review. Due to the unavailability of pre-existing risk data
(<code>Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON</code>), this assessment does not
include previously tracked vulnerabilities.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified
risks and improve the overall security posture of Radiant Life.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (Critical
Priority):</strong> Address RISK-001 by deploying MFA across the
organization. The rollout should be prioritized as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Phase 1:</strong> All email accounts and
privileged/administrator accounts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Phase 2:</strong> All systems containing sensitive or
critical data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Phase 3:</strong> All remaining user workstations and
network access points (e.g., VPN).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> To mitigate RISK-002, draft a formal AUP that clearly
defines the rules for using company networks, devices, and data. This
policy should be communicated to all employees, and their acknowledgment
should be formally tracked.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Integrate Security into Employee Onboarding:</strong> To
address RISK-003, create a mandatory security awareness training module
for all new hires. This training should be a required part of the
onboarding process before system access is granted and should cover
topics like phishing, password security, and the new AUP.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct a New External Network Scan:</strong> It is
imperative to gain visibility into the technical attack surface. A new,
comprehensive Nmap or vulnerability scan of the external IP address
(<code>167.202.201.129</code>) must be scheduled and successfully
completed. The results should be analyzed for outdated software,
misconfigurations, and other vulnerabilities.</p></li>
