<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the cybersecurity
posture for <strong>Modern Myth</strong>, based on a synthesis of
organizational data, technical network scans, and a review of
pre-existing risk documentation. The assessment was conducted to
identify security gaps, validate existing controls, and provide
actionable recommendations to enhance the organization’s overall
security resilience.</p>
<h4 id="key-findings">Key Findings:</h4>
<p>The analysis reveals a mixed security posture. The organization has
implemented several positive security controls, including mandatory
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive systems, as
well as a robust security awareness training program. Furthermore, a
technical scan of the host at <code>192.168.0.5</code> indicates that a
previously identified risk—an open and unencrypted web server on Port
80—appears to have been remediated on that specific system, as the port
was found to be closed.</p>
<p>However, two significant areas of concern were identified through the
security controls review:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Critical Risk:</strong> Lack of mandatory MFA for logging
into employee computers. This exposes the organization to significant
risk from credential compromise and unauthorized endpoint
access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>High Risk:</strong> Absence of a formal employee
Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). This creates ambiguity regarding the secure
and appropriate use of company assets and data.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This report details these findings and concludes with prioritized,
actionable recommendations designed to mitigate the identified risks and
strengthen the organization’s defensive capabilities.</p>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A review of organizational security controls was conducted based on a
standardized questionnaire. The responses are summarized below and
indicate the current state of implemented policies and procedures. Gaps
identified here represent significant organizational risks.</p>

<h4 id="analysis-of-gaps">Analysis of Gaps:</h4>
<p>The responses marked with a  highlight critical deficiencies in the
organization’s security framework. The lack of MFA on computer logins is
a primary concern, as it removes a vital layer of defense against stolen
credentials. Additionally, the absence of an Acceptable Use Policy can
lead to inconsistent security practices and a lack of legal and
administrative recourse for technology misuse.</p>

<h4 id="analysis">Analysis:</h4>
<p>The scan revealed that Port 80 (HTTP) is closed on the target system.
This is a positive security finding, as it prevents unencrypted web
traffic. This result directly contradicts a pre-existing risk entry
which stated this port was open. This suggests that the previously
identified vulnerability has been successfully remediated on this host,
or the risk documentation was inaccurate.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actions are recommended to address the active risks
identified during this assessment. Recommendations are prioritized based
on severity and potential impact.</p>
<h2 id="implement-mfa-for-endpoint-access-priority-critical">Implement
MFA for Endpoint Access (Priority: Critical)</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Action:</dt>
<dd>
<p>Deploy a mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication solution for all
employee computer and laptop logins. This should apply to both
on-premise and remote access.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Justification:</dt>
<dd>
<p>Stolen or weak passwords are a leading cause of security breaches.
Enforcing MFA at the endpoint level provides a critical layer of defense
that protects against unauthorized access even if an employee’s
credentials are compromised.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2
id="develop-and-implement-an-acceptable-use-policy-priority-high">Develop
and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy (Priority: High)</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Action:</dt>
<dd>
<p>Create a formal Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) that clearly defines the
rules and expectations for all users of the organization’s network and
IT resources. This policy should be reviewed by legal counsel,
communicated to all employees, and formally acknowledged via
signature.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Justification:</dt>
<dd>
<p>An AUP is a foundational security document that reduces
organizational risk by establishing clear guidelines for behavior,
protecting against data loss, and providing a framework for enforcing
security standards.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="validate-risk-register-accuracy-priority-informational">Validate
Risk Register Accuracy (Priority: Informational)</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Action:</dt>
<dd>
<p>Conduct a review of the existing risk register to validate the status
of other documented vulnerabilities. The finding that the "Unencrypted
Web Server" risk was remediated on host <code>192.168.0.5</code> should
be formally documented, and the risk should be marked as closed or
updated.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Justification:</dt>
<dd>
<p>An accurate and up-to-date risk register is essential for effective
security management, resource allocation, and strategic planning.</p>
