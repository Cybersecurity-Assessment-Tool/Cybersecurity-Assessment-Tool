<p><strong>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</strong></p>
<p><strong>Prepared for:</strong><br />
Iron River Finance</p>
<p><strong>Date of Report:</strong><br />
2026-01-31</p>
<p><em>This report contains sensitive information and is intended solely
for the use of the recipient.</em></p>
</div>
<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a cybersecurity assessment for Iron River
Finance, based on a security controls questionnaire, a network
vulnerability scan, and a review of pre-existing risks. The assessment
identifies the organization’s current security posture, highlights key
areas of risk, and offers actionable recommendations for
improvement.</p>
<p>The primary findings indicate a mixed security posture. While the
organization has implemented important controls such as Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for computer and sensitive system access, two
significant gaps were identified that expose the organization to
critical and high levels of risk:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Critical Risk - No MFA for Email:</strong> The absence of
MFA on email accounts is a critical vulnerability. It significantly
increases the risk of Business Email Compromise (BEC), phishing success,
and unauthorized access to sensitive data communicated via
email.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>High Risk - Lack of Annual Security Training:</strong>
While new employees receive training, the lack of a mandatory annual
security awareness program for all staff can lead to knowledge decay,
making the organization more susceptible to evolving social engineering
and phishing tactics.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>On a positive note, the external network scan of the target IP
address, <code>[Target IP]</code>, did not reveal any open ports. This
suggests a strong firewall configuration that effectively limits the
external attack surface. No pre-existing vulnerabilities were
reported.</p>
<p>Recommendations are prioritized to address the most severe risks
first, focusing on the immediate implementation of MFA for email and the
establishment of a recurring security awareness training program.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following information was provided for the assessment.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Organization Name:</strong> Iron River Finance</p></li>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>The following table summarizes the organization’s responses to the
security controls questionnaire. A green checkmark () indicates a
positive control is in place, while a red cross () indicates a potential
security gap.</p>

<p>The review highlights two key areas for improvement: email security
and ongoing employee training, which are detailed in the Risk Assessment
section.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was conducted to identify potential
vulnerabilities on the organization’s perimeter.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not provided in scan data.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="summary-of-findings">Summary of Findings</h2>
<p>The network scan did not identify any open TCP or UDP ports on the
target system. This is a positive security finding, indicating that a
firewall or other network security device is likely in place and
configured to deny unsolicited inbound traffic. This significantly
reduces the external attack surface available to potential
adversaries.</p>
<p><em>Note: This result assumes the target host was online and
reachable during the assessment period.</em></p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section correlates the findings from the security control review
and technical scan. The following risks have been identified and
prioritized based on their potential impact on the organization.</p>

<td style="text-align: left;">The absence of MFA on email accounts makes
them highly vulnerable to compromise via stolen or weak passwords. A
compromised email account can lead to data breaches, financial fraud
(BEC), and further infiltration of the network.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>High</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Without mandatory, annual security
training, employees’ ability to recognize and respond to modern threats
like phishing and social engineering diminishes over time. This

incident.</td>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following recommendations are provided to mitigate the identified
risks and strengthen the overall security posture of Iron River Finance.
They are prioritized based on the severity of the associated risk.</p>
<h2 id="priority-1-implement-mfa-for-email-critical">Priority 1:
Implement MFA for Email (Critical)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediately begin the process of
enabling and mandating Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all user
and administrative email accounts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> This is the single most effective
control to prevent unauthorized access to email. It provides a critical
layer of defense against password-based attacks, even if user
credentials are stolen.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implementation Guidance:</strong> Prioritize
authenticator applications (e.g., Google Authenticator, Microsoft
Authenticator) or hardware tokens (e.g., YubiKey) over SMS-based MFA,
which is susceptible to SIM-swapping attacks.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2
id="priority-2-establish-annual-security-awareness-training-high">Priority
2: Establish Annual Security Awareness Training (High)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop and implement a formal,
mandatory security awareness training program for all employees to be
completed at least once per year.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> Regular training reinforces
security best practices and keeps employees informed about the latest
threat trends. This creates a more resilient "human firewall" and
reduces the risk of incidents caused by human error.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implementation Guidance:</strong> The training program
should cover key topics such as phishing identification, password
security, acceptable use of company assets, and incident reporting
procedures. Consider incorporating periodic phishing simulation
exercises to test and reinforce the training.</p></li>
