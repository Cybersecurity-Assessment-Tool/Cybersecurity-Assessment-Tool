% --- 1. Executive Summary ---
\section{Executive Summary}

This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity assessment for \textbf{Binary Star}, based on a correlation of network scan data, organizational security controls, and pre-existing risk information.

The overall security posture is determined to be critically weak. The analysis uncovered significant, high-impact vulnerabilities that expose the organization to a high likelihood of a security breach. Key findings include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Exposed Critical Infrastructure:} A network scan identified a MySQL database (Port 3306) directly exposed to the network. Further analysis revealed the database software, MySQL version 5.7.33, is End-of-Life (EOL) and no longer receives security updates.
    \item \textbf{Absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):} The organization has not implemented MFA for any critical access points, including email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. This represents a critical failure in identity and access management.
    \item \textbf{Lack of Foundational Security Policies:} There is a complete absence of an employee acceptable use policy and any form of security awareness training. This indicates a low level of security maturity and leaves the organization highly vulnerable to social engineering and human error.
\end{itemize}

Immediate and decisive action is required to remediate these findings. Recommendations outlined in this report prioritize the containment of the exposed database and the rapid implementation of MFA.

\section{Organizational Information}

The following details were provided for the assessment.

\begin{tabular}{@{}ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Attribute} & \textbf{Value} \\
\midrule
Organization Name & \textbf{Binary Star} \\
Email Domain & \texttt{BinaryStar.com} \\
External IP Address & \texttt{58.181.164.65} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}

% --- 3. Security Control Review ---
\section{Security Control Review}

A review of organizational security controls was conducted via a questionnaire. The responses indicate critical gaps in fundamental security practices. A checkmark (\ding{51}) indicates a positive control, while a cross (\ding{55}) indicates a control gap.

\begin{tabular}{@{}p{0.6\linewidth} c p{0.25\linewidth}@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Control Question} & \textbf{Response} & \textbf{Analyst Assessment} \\
\midrule
Do you require MFA to access email? & \ding{55} & \textcolor{critical}{\textbf{Critical Gap}}. Unprotected email is a primary vector for account takeover and phishing. \\
\addlinespace
Do you require MFA to log into computers? & \ding{55} & \textcolor{high}{\textbf{High Risk}}. Lack of MFA allows for easier lateral movement after an initial compromise. \\
\addlinespace
Do you require MFA to access sensitive data systems? & \ding{55} & \textcolor{critical}{\textbf{Critical Gap}}. Direct, single-factor access to sensitive systems is extremely dangerous. \\
\addlinespace
Does your organization have an employee acceptable use policy? & \ding{55} & \textcolor{high}{\textbf{High Risk}}. Lack of a formal policy creates ambiguity and increases insider threat risk. \\
\addlinespace
Does your organization do security awareness training for new employees? & \ding{55} & \textcolor{high}{\textbf{High Risk}}. New employees are not equipped to identify or respond to security threats. \\
\addlinespace
Does your organization do security awareness training for all employees at least once per year? & \ding{55} & \textcolor{high}{\textbf{High Risk}}. The organization's human firewall is completely undeveloped and untested. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}

% --- 4. Technical Scan Results ---
\section{Technical Scan Results}

An external network scan was performed against the target IP address \texttt{172.16.50.20}. The scan identified the following open port and service.

\subsection{Open Ports}

\begin{tabular}{@{}lllll@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Port} & \textbf{State} & \textbf{Service} & \textbf{Product} & \textbf{Version} \\
\midrule
3306/tcp & open & mysql & MySQL & 5.7.33 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Technical Analysis}
The open MySQL port (3306) is a significant finding and directly confirms the pre-existing risk of "Database Exposure". Databases should not be directly accessible from the network unless absolutely necessary and protected by stringent access controls.

More critically, the detected version, \textbf{MySQL 5.7.33}, is \textbf{End-of-Life (EOL)} as of October 2023. This means it no longer receives security patches from the vendor, and known vulnerabilities will remain unpatched. Running EOL software, especially on an exposed critical service, presents an unacceptable level of risk.

% --- 5. Risk Assessment Summary ---
\section{Risk Assessment Summary}

The following table synthesizes findings from the security control review, technical scan, and pre-existing risk data into a prioritized list of current risks.

\begin{tabular}{@{}p{0.25\linewidth} p{0.5\linewidth} p{0.15\linewidth}@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Risk Name} & \textbf{Description} & \textbf{Severity} \\
\midrule
\textbf{Exposed End-of-Life Database} & A MySQL 5.7.33 database is publicly accessible on port 3306. The software is no longer supported and contains unpatchable vulnerabilities, posing an imminent threat of data breach. & \textcolor{critical}{\textbf{CRITICAL}} \\
\addlinespace
\textbf{Widespread Lack of MFA} & Multi-Factor Authentication is not enforced on any system, including email and sensitive data platforms. This severely weakens access controls and makes account compromise trivial. & \textcolor{critical}{\textbf{CRITICAL}} \\
\addlinespace
\textbf{Lack of Security Policies and Training} & The absence of an Acceptable Use Policy and any security awareness training program leaves the organization highly susceptible to human-related threats like phishing and insider error. & \textcolor{high}{\textbf{HIGH}} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}

% --- 6. Recommendations ---
\section{Recommendations}

The following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified risks. These are prioritized based on severity and impact.

\subsection{Immediate Actions (Next 72 Hours)}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Contain Exposed Database:} Immediately apply firewall rules to block all public access to TCP port 3306 on host \texttt{172.16.50.20}. Access should only be permitted from trusted internal IP addresses or via a secure VPN connection.
    \item \textbf{Enable MFA on Critical Accounts:} Begin emergency rollout of MFA for all administrative accounts and for access to critical systems, especially email (e.g., Office 365, Google Workspace).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Short-Term Actions (Next 30-60 Days)}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Upgrade Database Software:} Plan and execute an urgent migration from MySQL 5.7 to a currently supported version (e.g., MySQL 8.0 or later). This is critical to ensure the system can receive security patches.
    \item \textbf{Implement Widespread MFA:} Complete the rollout of MFA for all users across all major platforms, including email, VPN, and computer logins.
    \item \textbf{Develop an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):} Draft and implement a formal AUP that clearly defines the rules for using company technology and data. All employees must read and acknowledge this policy.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Long-Term Actions (Next 90+ Days)}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Establish Security Awareness Training Program:} Implement a mandatory security awareness training program for all new and existing employees. This program should be conducted annually and cover topics such as phishing, password security, and social engineering.
    \item \textbf{Conduct Regular Vulnerability Scanning:} Implement a routine vulnerability scanning program for all external and internal assets to proactively identify and remediate security weaknesses.
\end{enumerate}
