<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides an assessment of the cybersecurity posture for
North Star Education. The analysis is primarily based on a review of
organizational security controls provided via a questionnaire. It is
critical to note that the technical network scan data and the list of
pre-existing risks were both corrupted and unavailable for this
assessment.</p>
<p>The primary findings indicate significant gaps in fundamental
security controls. The most critical risk identified is the lack of
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access, which exposes the
organization to a high risk of business email compromise and phishing
attacks.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the absence of a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy
and the lack of security awareness training for new hires represent
high-risk administrative gaps. These deficiencies weaken the
organization’s human firewall and increase susceptibility to social
engineering and insider threats.</p>
<p>Immediate remediation should focus on implementing MFA for email,
developing and enforcing key security policies, and integrating security
training into the employee onboarding process. A comprehensive external
network scan is strongly recommended to identify and address technical
vulnerabilities that could not be assessed at this time.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following details were provided for the assessment.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Organization Name:</strong> North Star Education</p></li>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>The following table summarizes the organization’s responses to the
security controls questionnaire. Items marked with indicate a control
gap that increases organizational risk.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<h2 id="status">Status</h2>
<p>The provided network scan data
(<code>Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON</code>) was found to be corrupted and
could not be parsed. Therefore, no analysis of open ports, running
services, or potential software vulnerabilities could be performed on
the target IP address (<code>165.213.19.14</code>).</p>
<h2 id="impact">Impact</h2>
<p>Without a successful network scan, the organization has no visibility
into its external attack surface. Potentially vulnerable services
exposed to the internet remain undiscovered and unmitigated. It is
imperative to conduct a new scan to identify these unknown risks.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>The pre-existing risk register
(<code>Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON</code>) was unavailable for this

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis, the following prioritized actions are
recommended to mitigate the identified risks and improve the overall
security posture of North Star Education.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>[Critical] Implement MFA for Email Access:</strong>
Immediately enforce MFA for all user and administrative accounts with
access to the <code>NorthStarEducation.com</code> email system. This is
the single most effective control to prevent account
compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>[High] Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a formal AUP that clearly defines the rules and
responsibilities for all employees when using company IT assets. Require
all employees to read and acknowledge the policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>[High] Institute Mandatory Onboarding Security
Training:</strong> Develop a security awareness training module that is
a mandatory part of the new employee onboarding process. This training
should cover phishing, password security, and the new AUP.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>[Informational] Conduct a New External Network
Scan:</strong> Commission a new, comprehensive vulnerability scan of the
external IP address (<code>165.213.19.14</code>) to identify and
remediate technical vulnerabilities on the network perimeter.</p></li>
