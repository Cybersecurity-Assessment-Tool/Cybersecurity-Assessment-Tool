<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment conducted for <strong>Modern Myth</strong>. The evaluation
combined a technical network scan, a review of existing risks, and an
analysis of organizational security controls based on a
questionnaire.</p>
<p>The assessment revealed a mixed security posture. On a technical
level, the organization demonstrates a strong perimeter defense. The
external network scan of the target host <code>192.168.1.100</code>
found <strong>no open ports</strong>, indicating a robust and
well-configured firewall. This significantly reduces the external attack
surface.</p>
<p>However, a critical administrative gap was identified in the employee
onboarding process. The lack of mandatory security awareness training
for new employees presents a <strong>High</strong> risk. New hires are
often prime targets for social engineering attacks, and without proper
initial training, the organization is more susceptible to incidents
originating from human error, such as falling victim to phishing
campaigns.</p>
<p>Immediate remediation should focus on implementing a mandatory
security training module into the new employee onboarding process. While
the technical controls are currently effective, strengthening the human
element of the security program is essential for comprehensive risk
reduction.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>The following table summarizes the organization’s responses to a
security controls questionnaire. A checkmark () indicates a positive
control is in place, while a cross () indicates a potential gap.</p>

<h4 id="analysis">Analysis:</h4>
<p>The organization has implemented strong identity and access
management controls with consistent MFA enforcement. The presence of an
acceptable use policy and annual security training are also positive
indicators. The primary weakness identified is the failure to provide
security awareness training specifically for new employees during their
onboarding period.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed to identify accessible
services and potential vulnerabilities on the perimeter.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>192.168.1.100</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> As of the date of this
report.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Key Finding:</strong> <strong>No open ports were
detected.</strong> All probed ports were in a ’closed’ state.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="analysis-1">Analysis:</h4>
<p>This result is highly favorable and indicates a very strong security
posture for the scanned host. A lack of open ports means that there are
no listening services exposed to the public internet, effectively
minimizing the attack surface and preventing unauthorized access
attempts against common services. This suggests a well-configured
firewall is in place.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes findings from the security control review,
technical scans, and pre-existing risk data. The primary risk identified
during this assessment is detailed below.</p>

</table>
<h4 id="risk-001-justification">Risk-001 Justification:</h4>
<p>New employees are statistically more likely to be targeted by and
fall for social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting).
Without immediate training on organizational security policies and
common threats, they represent a significant weak link. A successful
attack could lead to credential compromise, malware infection, or a data
breach.</p>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified
risks and improve the overall security posture of <strong>Modern
Myth</strong>.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="priority-1-high">Priority 1: High</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Recommendation:</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>Implement Mandatory Onboarding Security
Training.</strong></p>
</dd>
<dt>Details:</dt>
<dd>
<p>Develop and integrate a mandatory security awareness training module
into the formal onboarding process for all new hires, including
contractors. This training should occur within the first week of
employment and cover, at a minimum:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The organization’s Acceptable Use Policy.</p></li>
<li><p>How to identify and report phishing attempts.</p></li>
<li><p>Best practices for password management and data
handling.</p></li>
<li><p>The importance of MFA.</p></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Justification:</dt>
<dd>
<p>This action directly mitigates RISK-001 by ensuring that new
personnel are equipped with fundamental security knowledge from day one,
drastically reducing their susceptibility to common cyber threats.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="priority-2-informational">Priority 2:
Informational</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Recommendation:</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>Maintain and Validate Network Security Posture.</strong></p>
</dd>
<dt>Details:</dt>
<dd>
<p>The current network perimeter security is excellent. It is
recommended to continue this practice through:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Regular, automated vulnerability scanning of external
assets.</p></li>
<li><p>Periodic firewall rule set reviews to ensure continued adherence
to the principle of least privilege.</p></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Justification:</dt>
<dd>
<p>Proactive maintenance and validation will ensure that the strong
technical security posture observed during this assessment is not
degraded over time by configuration changes or newly discovered
vulnerabilities.</p>
