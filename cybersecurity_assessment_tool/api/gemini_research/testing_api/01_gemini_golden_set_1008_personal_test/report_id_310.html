<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment conducted for <strong>Firebrand Media</strong>. The
assessment combined a review of organizational security controls via a
questionnaire, a technical network scan of the external perimeter, and
an analysis of pre-existing risk data.</p>
<p>The key findings indicate a significant disparity between the
organization’s external network security and its internal security
maturity. The external network scan of the target IP address revealed no
open ports, suggesting a robust firewall configuration that effectively
limits the external attack surface. This is a strong positive
finding.</p>
<p>However, the security control review identified several critical and
high-risk gaps. The most severe issues are the lack of Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems, and a
complete absence of a formal security awareness training program and an
employee acceptable use policy. These deficiencies expose
<strong>Firebrand Media</strong> to a high risk of account compromise,
data breaches, and successful social engineering attacks.</p>
<p>Immediate remediation should focus on implementing MFA across all
critical systems and establishing a foundational security awareness and
policy framework to mitigate the most pressing human-centric risks.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following information was provided for the assessment.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Organization Name:</strong> Firebrand Media</p></li>

<p>The following table summarizes the organization’s responses to the
security controls questionnaire. A green checkmark () indicates a
positive control is in place, while a red cross () indicates a control
gap that introduces risk.</p>

<p>The review reveals critical weaknesses in authentication security for
email and sensitive data, as well as a complete lack of foundational
employee-facing security policies and training.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network port scan was conducted to assess the external attack
surface of the organization’s provided IP address.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Target:</strong> <code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> 2026-01-31</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="summary-of-findings">Summary of Findings</h2>
<p>No open TCP or UDP ports were detected on the target system. All
ports scanned appeared to be in a <code>closed</code> or
<code>filtered</code> state.</p>
<h2 id="interpretation">Interpretation</h2>
<p>This result is a strong indicator of a well-configured perimeter
firewall. It suggests that the organization is not exposing any
unnecessary services to the public internet, which significantly reduces
the risk of direct network-based attacks. This is a positive security
finding. However, it is recommended to confirm that the target IP was
correct and the system was operational during the scan to ensure the
validity of this result.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>The following table synthesizes risks identified from the security
control review, technical scan, and pre-existing vulnerability data. As
no pre-existing risks were provided, this assessment is based solely on
the data collected for this report.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended to
improve the cybersecurity posture of <strong>Firebrand Media</strong>.
Recommendations are prioritized by severity.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>(Critical) Implement Comprehensive MFA:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Immediately enforce MFA for all user accounts on the primary
email platform (e.g., Microsoft 365, Google Workspace).</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct an inventory of all systems that process or store
sensitive data and prioritize the rollout of MFA for access to these
systems.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>(High) Establish a Security Awareness
Program:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and implement a mandatory security awareness training
module for all new employees as part of the onboarding process.</p></li>
<li><p>Schedule and conduct annual, mandatory security training for all
staff. This training should cover key topics such as phishing
identification, password security, and safe browsing habits.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>(High) Develop and Implement Foundational Security
Policies:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Draft, approve, and publish an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP). This policy should clearly define the rules and responsibilities
for using company information technology assets.</p></li>
<li><p>Require all current employees and new hires to read and formally
acknowledge the AUP.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>(Informational) Verify Network Scan Target:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Internally confirm that the target IP address
<code>[Target IP]</code> was the correct external endpoint and that the
associated system was online and operational during the scan. This will
validate the positive finding of a secure network perimeter.</p></li>
</ul></li>
