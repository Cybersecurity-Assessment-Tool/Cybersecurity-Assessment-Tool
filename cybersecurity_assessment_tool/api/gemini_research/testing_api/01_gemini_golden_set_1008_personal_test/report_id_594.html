<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for <strong>Cinder &amp; Ash</strong>. The analysis is based on a review
of organizational security controls, a technical network scan, and a
correlation with pre-existing risk data.</p>
<p>The assessment identified several critical and high-risk security
gaps. The most significant finding is the complete absence of
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email, computer systems,
and sensitive data. This represents a critical vulnerability that
substantially increases the risk of unauthorized access and account
compromise.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the lack of a mandatory annual security awareness
training program for all employees is a high-risk finding. This gap can
lead to a decreased vigilance against social engineering attacks, such
as phishing.</p>
<p>A technical network scan was performed on the target system . The
scan found no open ports, indicating a secure perimeter at the time of
testing. Notably, this finding contradicts a pre-existing risk entry
regarding an unencrypted web server on port 80. This suggests the risk
may have been remediated, and the risk register requires updating.</p>
<p>Immediate recommendations focus on the enterprise-wide deployment of
MFA and the establishment of a recurring security training program to
mitigate these pressing risks.</p>

<p>A review of administrative and organizational security controls was
conducted via a questionnaire. The results below highlight key areas of
strength and weakness. A checkmark () indicates a positive control is in
place, while a cross () indicates a control gap.</p>

<h4 id="analysis">Analysis:</h4>
<p>The absence of MFA for critical access points (email, computers, data
systems) is a critical deficiency. The lack of annual security training
for all staff is a high-risk gap that undermines the organization’s
resilience to human-targeted attacks.</p>

<p>The scan confirmed that port 80 (HTTP) was closed. No other open
ports were detected. This is a positive security finding, as it limits
the avenues for external attack. However, this result conflicts with
data from the current risk register, which lists an open port 80 as an
active vulnerability. This discrepancy is addressed in the following
section.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actionable recommendations are provided to address the
identified risks. They are prioritized based on severity.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>[Critical] Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Immediately:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Prioritize the deployment of a robust MFA solution for all
employees and contractors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Phase 1:</strong> Enforce MFA on all external-facing
services, including email (e.g., Office 365, Google Workspace) and VPN
access. This should be completed as a top priority.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Phase 2:</strong> Extend MFA enforcement to all computer
logins and access to systems containing sensitive or critical
data.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>[High] Establish a Mandatory Annual Security Training
Program:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Procure or develop a security awareness training module that
covers modern threats like phishing, ransomware, and business email
compromise.</p></li>
<li><p>Make this training mandatory for all employees on an annual
basis, with tracking and reporting to ensure completion.</p></li>
<li><p>Supplement annual training with periodic phishing simulation
campaigns to test and reinforce employee awareness.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>[Low] Reconcile and Maintain the Risk
Register:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Conduct an internal verification to confirm that the service on
port 80 has been decommissioned or secured.</p></li>
<li><p>Update the risk register to formally close the "Unencrypted Web
Server" risk, including details of the remediation action.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement a process for regularly reviewing and updating the risk
register to ensure it remains an accurate tool for managing
cybersecurity risk.</p></li>
