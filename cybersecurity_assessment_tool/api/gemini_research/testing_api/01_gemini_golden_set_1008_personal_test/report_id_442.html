<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-overview">1. Executive
Overview</h1>
<p>The purpose of this assessment was to evaluate the external security
posture and internal security controls of <strong>Cinder &amp;
Ash</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Strengths:</strong> The organization has implemented crucial
security controls, including Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email
and sensitive data systems, and conducts annual security awareness
training for all staff. These measures significantly reduce the risk of
account compromise and help maintain a security-conscious culture among
existing employees.</p>
<p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Two significant vulnerabilities were
identified through the security questionnaire.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Critical Risk:</strong> The lack of MFA for computer
logins exposes the organization to significant risk from compromised
credentials. An attacker with a valid password could gain direct access
to an endpoint and the internal network.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>High Risk:</strong> New employees do not receive security
awareness training upon being hired. This creates a window of
vulnerability where new staff are more susceptible to social engineering
and phishing attacks.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The external network scan against the target IP address did not
identify any open ports, suggesting a well-configured firewall or that
the host was not responsive at the time of the scan. No pre-existing
vulnerabilities were noted.</p>
<p>This report details these findings and provides actionable
recommendations to mitigate the identified risks and strengthen the
overall security posture.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">4. Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed to identify open ports and
exposed services.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> [Scan Date]</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="findings">Findings</h2>
<p>The scan completed successfully but returned <strong>no open
ports</strong>. This result typically indicates one of the following
scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The target host is protected by a well-configured firewall that
drops or rejects all unsolicited incoming traffic (a positive security
posture).</p></li>
<li><p>The target host was offline or not responsive during the scan
period.</p></li>
<li><p>An Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) may have blocked the scan
traffic.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>While no vulnerabilities were discovered, it is recommended to
confirm that this result is intentional and not due to a network or
configuration issue.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment">5. Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes the findings from the security control
review and technical scan to provide a consolidated list of identified
risks. No pre-existing risks were reported.</p>

<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Lack of MFA for Workstation
Login</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Critical</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The absence of MFA on computer logins
means that a compromised password is all an attacker needs to gain
access to a user’s workstation and, potentially, the entire internal
network. This greatly increases the impact of phishing and credential
stuffing attacks.</td>

Training</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>High</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">New employees are not provided with
security awareness training upon hiring. This makes them highly
susceptible to social engineering attacks as they are unfamiliar with
corporate security policies, procedures, and common threats, creating an
immediate and exploitable vulnerability.</td>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">6. Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actionable recommendations are provided to address the
identified risks and improve the overall security posture of
<strong>Cinder &amp; Ash</strong>.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="r-01-implement-mfa-for-workstation-login-critical">R-01: Implement
MFA for Workstation Login (Critical)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Deploy a mandatory Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) solution for all employee and privileged user
logins to company workstations and laptops.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> This control acts as a critical
compensating measure against credential theft. Even if an attacker
obtains a user’s password, they will be unable to log in without the
second factor (e.g., a mobile push notification, authenticator code, or
hardware token).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Suggested Solutions:</strong> Windows Hello for Business,
Duo Security, Okta, or other third-party identity providers that
integrate with Active Directory or local login providers.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="r-02-institute-mandatory-new-hire-security-training-high">R-02:
Institute Mandatory New Hire Security Training (High)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop and integrate a mandatory
security awareness training module into the new employee onboarding
process. This training must be completed before a new hire is granted
full access to company systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> Equipping new employees with
security knowledge from day one is essential to building a strong human
firewall. It reduces the likelihood of them falling victim to
early-stage phishing or social engineering attempts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Topics to Cover:</strong> Phishing and spear-phishing
identification, acceptable use of company assets, password security
policies, and the official procedure for reporting security
incidents.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="r-03-verify-external-network-scan-configuration">R-03: Verify
External Network Scan Configuration</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Internally verify that the scan target
<code>[Target IP]</code> was correct and that no network issues
prevented the scan from reaching the host.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> While no open ports is a positive
sign, it is crucial to confirm that this is the expected behavior. A
follow-up authenticated vulnerability scan from an internal perspective
is recommended for a more comprehensive assessment of system patch
levels and configurations.</p></li>
