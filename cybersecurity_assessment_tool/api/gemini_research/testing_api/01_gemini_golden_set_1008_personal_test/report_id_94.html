<h1 id="executive-overview">Executive Overview</h1>
<p>This report provides a cybersecurity posture assessment for
<strong>Harbor Light Foundation</strong>, based on a review of
organizational security controls, an external network scan, and an
analysis of known risks.</p>
<p>The assessment reveals several critical and high-risk security gaps
that require immediate attention. The most significant weaknesses are
procedural and policy-based. Specifically, the lack of Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) on email and sensitive data systems exposes the
organization to a high risk of account compromise, data breach, and
ransomware attacks. Furthermore, the complete absence of a security
awareness training program leaves the organization and its employees
highly vulnerable to phishing and social engineering attacks.</p>
<p>The external network scan of the designated target IP address did not
detect any open ports. While this can indicate a strong firewall
configuration, it does not preclude vulnerabilities on internal systems
or web applications.</p>
<p>Immediate remediation should focus on implementing MFA across all
critical platforms and establishing a comprehensive security awareness
training program to mitigate the most severe threats identified in this
report.</p>

<p>A review of the organization’s security controls was conducted via a
standardized questionnaire. The responses indicate key areas of strength
and weakness in the current security posture. A <span
style="color: green"></span> indicates a positive control is in place,
while a <span style="color: red"></span> indicates a security gap.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network vulnerability scan was performed to identify
exposed services and potential weaknesses on the organization’s
perimeter.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Target:</strong> <code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> 2026-01-31</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Findings:</strong> The scan completed successfully but
did not identify any open TCP or UDP ports on the target host.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>No open ports were detected. This finding suggests that a firewall or
other network security device is effectively blocking unsolicited
inbound traffic to the scanned IP address. While this is a positive
indicator for perimeter security, it does not provide visibility into
vulnerabilities that may exist on internal systems or web applications
hosted behind the firewall.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>The following table synthesizes findings from the security control
review and technical scan. No pre-existing vulnerabilities were provided
for this assessment. The identified risks are based entirely on the data
collected.</p>

<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Lack of MFA on Critical
Systems</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Email and sensitive data systems are
protected only by username and password. This creates a single point of
failure and makes accounts highly susceptible to compromise via
phishing, credential stuffing, or password spraying attacks. A breach of
these systems could lead to significant data loss and operational
disruption.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>No Security Awareness
Training</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Employees are not trained to identify or
respond to common cyber threats like phishing, malware, or social
engineering. This significantly increases the likelihood of an employee
inadvertently causing a security incident, which is the root cause of
most successful cyberattacks.</td>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended to
mitigate the identified risks and improve the overall security posture
of <strong>Harbor Light Foundation</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="immediate-priority-critical-risks">Immediate Priority (Critical
Risks)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email:</strong> Immediately enforce MFA
for all user access to the email system
(<code>HarborLightFoundation.com</code>). This is the single most
effective control to prevent unauthorized account access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data:</strong> Identify all
systems containing sensitive organizational or client data and enforce
MFA for all user access.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="high-priority-high-risks">High Priority (High Risks)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Establish Security Awareness Training Program:</strong>
Develop and implement a mandatory security awareness training program
for all employees. The program should be required for new hires during
onboarding and annually for all staff.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Phishing Simulations:</strong> Periodically
conduct simulated phishing campaigns to test employee awareness and
reinforce training concepts. Use the results to provide targeted
follow-up training.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="general-recommendations">General Recommendations</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Comprehensive Vulnerability Assessment:</strong> Schedule
a comprehensive, authenticated vulnerability assessment of internal and
external systems. This will provide deeper insight into potential
software vulnerabilities that an unauthenticated external scan cannot
detect.</p></li>
