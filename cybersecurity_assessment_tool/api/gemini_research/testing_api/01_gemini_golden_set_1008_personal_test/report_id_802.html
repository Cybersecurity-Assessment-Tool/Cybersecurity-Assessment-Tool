<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment for <strong>Grizzly Peak</strong>, conducted on 2026-01-31.
The assessment combined a review of organizational security controls, an
external network vulnerability scan, and an analysis of pre-existing
risks.</p>
<p>The key findings indicate a mixed security posture. While the
organization has implemented some foundational controls, such as an
acceptable use policy and annual security training, several critical
gaps were identified. The most significant risks stem from the lack of
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and access to
sensitive data systems. Additionally, the absence of security awareness
training during the new-hire onboarding process creates a significant
window of vulnerability.</p>
<p>The external network scan of the target IP address
<code>[Target IP]</code> did not identify any open ports, which suggests
a potentially well-configured firewall. However, this should be verified
to ensure the scan was not inadvertently blocked. No pre-existing
vulnerabilities were documented for this assessment.</p>
<p>Immediate remediation should focus on implementing a comprehensive
MFA policy and integrating security training into the employee
onboarding process.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A security questionnaire was completed to evaluate the organization’s
current administrative and technical controls. The responses are
summarized below. Gaps identified in this review are addressed in the
Risk Assessment section.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed to identify open ports and
exposed services on the public-facing infrastructure.</p>
<h2 id="scan-details">Scan Details</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> 2023-10-27</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="findings">Findings</h2>
<p>The network scan against the target IP address <strong>did not detect
any open ports</strong>. This outcome often indicates that a firewall is
properly configured to deny unsolicited external traffic, which is a
positive security practice. However, it is also possible that the scan
was blocked by an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) or other network
security appliance. Further internal verification is recommended to
confirm that the absence of open ports is intentional and not the result
of a failed or blocked scan.</p>

and technical scan. The following table outlines the identified risks,

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the risk assessment, the following actions are recommended
to improve the cybersecurity posture of <strong>Grizzly Peak</strong>.
Recommendations are prioritized by severity.</p>
<h2 id="critical-priority">Critical Priority</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong>
Immediately deploy a mandatory MFA policy for all user accounts
(including administrative and service accounts) that have access to
systems containing sensitive, confidential, or proprietary data. This is
the single most effective control to prevent unauthorized access and
data breaches.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="high-priority">High Priority</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Enforce MFA for Endpoint Logins:</strong> Require MFA for
all employee computer and laptop logins. This strengthens endpoint
security and mitigates the risk of unauthorized access resulting from
compromised credentials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Integrate Security Training into Onboarding:</strong>
Develop and implement a mandatory security awareness training module as
part of the new-hire onboarding process. This training should occur
within the first week of employment and cover topics such as phishing,
password security, and the acceptable use policy.</p></li>
