% --- Section 1: Executive Summary ---
\section{Executive Summary}

This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity assessment for Opal Sky Media, synthesizing data from organizational questionnaires, technical network scans, and a review of pre-existing risks.

The analysis reveals a mixed security posture. While the organization has implemented some positive controls, such as requiring Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer access and conducting annual security training, several critical vulnerabilities require immediate attention.

The most severe finding is a publicly exposed MySQL database service on an internal host (\texttt{172.16.50.20}). This database is running MySQL version 5.7.33, which is an unsupported, End-of-Life (EOL) version with known vulnerabilities. This finding, correlated with the pre-existing risk of "Database Exposure," represents a direct and significant threat to data confidentiality and integrity.

Furthermore, critical procedural gaps were identified, including the lack of mandatory MFA for email access and the absence of security awareness training for new employees. These weaknesses substantially increase the organization's susceptibility to phishing attacks, business email compromise, and insider threats.

This report outlines these findings in detail and provides a prioritized list of actionable recommendations to mitigate the identified risks and strengthen the overall security posture of Opal Sky Media.

% --- Section 2: Organizational Information ---
\section{Organizational Information}

This section details the organizational data provided for this assessment.

\begin{tabular}{@{}ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Attribute} & \textbf{Value} \\
\midrule
Organization Name & Opal Sky Media \\
Email Domain & \seqsplit{\texttt{OpalSkyMedia.net}} \\
Website Domain & \seqsplit{\texttt{www.OpalSkyMedia.net}} \\
External IP Address & \seqsplit{\texttt{207.183.151.179}} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}

% --- Section 3: Security Control Review ---
\section{Security Control Review}

The following table summarizes the organization's responses to a security controls questionnaire. Items marked with a cross (\no) indicate significant gaps in the security framework and are discussed in the Risk Assessment section.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{p{0.7\textwidth}c}
\toprule
\textbf{Question / Security Control} & \textbf{Status} \\
\midrule
Do you require MFA to access email? & \no \\
Do you require MFA to log into computers? & \yes \\
Do you require MFA to access sensitive data systems? & \yes \\
Does your organization have an employee acceptable use policy? & \yes \\
Does your organization do security awareness training for new employees? & \no \\
Does your organization do security awareness training for all employees at least once per year? & \yes \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\textbf{Analysis:} The lack of MFA on email is a critical vulnerability, as email accounts are a primary target for attackers seeking to launch phishing campaigns, commit fraud, or gain a foothold in the network. The absence of security training during employee onboarding creates a window of high risk where new staff members are unaware of organizational policies and common threats.

% --- Section 4: Technical Scan Results ---
\section{Technical Scan Results}

A network scan was performed to identify open ports and services on the target system. The results are detailed below.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Target IP Address:} \texttt{172.16.50.20}
    \item \textbf{Host Status:} Up
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lllll}
\toprule
\textbf{Port} & \textbf{State} & \textbf{Service} & \textbf{Product} & \textbf{Version} \\
\midrule
3306/tcp & Open & mysql & MySQL & 5.7.33 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\textbf{Analysis:} The scan confirms that port 3306 is open, exposing a MySQL database service. The detected version, \textbf{MySQL 5.7.33}, reached its official End-of-Life (EOL) in October 2023. EOL software no longer receives security updates from the vendor, leaving it perpetually vulnerable to newly discovered exploits. This finding directly corroborates and elevates the severity of the "Database Exposure" risk identified in Input 3.

% --- Section 5: Risk Assessment Summary ---
\section{Risk Assessment Summary}

This section correlates the findings from the security control review, technical scans, and pre-existing risk data into a prioritized list of security risks.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{p{0.3\textwidth}p{0.5\textwidth}l}
\toprule
\textbf{Risk Name} & \textbf{Description} & \textbf{Severity} \\
\midrule
\textbf{Exposed \& Outdated Database} & A MySQL database (v5.7.33) is exposed to the network on port 3306. The version is End-of-Life and no longer receives security patches. & \textbf{Critical} \\
\addlinespace
\textbf{No MFA on Email Accounts} & Email, a primary communication and identity tool, is not protected by Multi-Factor Authentication, making it highly vulnerable to compromise. & \textbf{Critical} \\
\addlinespace
\textbf{Inadequate Employee Onboarding} & New employees do not receive security awareness training, making them highly susceptible to social engineering and policy violations. & \textbf{High} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

% --- Section 6: Recommendations ---
\section{Recommendations}

The following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified risks. Recommendations are prioritized based on severity.

\subsection{Critical Risk: Exposed \& Outdated Database}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Immediate (Containment):} Implement strict firewall rules to block all access to TCP port 3306 on host \texttt{172.16.50.20} from any untrusted network. Access should only be permitted from specific, authorized application servers or administrative workstations.
    \item \textbf{Short-Term (Remediation):} Develop a plan to upgrade the MySQL 5.7.33 instance to a currently supported version (e.g., MySQL 8.0 or higher) to ensure it receives security patches.
    \item \textbf{Long-Term (Architectural):} For any required remote database access, implement a secure access solution such as a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or a bastion host (jump box) instead of direct exposure.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Critical Risk: No MFA on Email Accounts}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Immediate (Remediation):} Procure and enforce a mandatory MFA policy for all user accounts on the \texttt{OpalSkyMedia.net} email domain. This is the single most effective control to prevent unauthorized account access.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{High Risk: Inadequate Employee Onboarding}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Short-Term (Remediation):} Develop a mandatory security awareness training module and integrate it into the formal onboarding process for all new hires, to be completed within their first week of employment.
    \item \textbf{Long-Term (Process Improvement):} The training should cover key topics such as the acceptable use policy, phishing identification, password hygiene, and incident reporting procedures.
\end{enumerate}
