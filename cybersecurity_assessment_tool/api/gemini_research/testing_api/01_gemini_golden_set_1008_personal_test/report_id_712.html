<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity assessment for
<strong>Aventine Research</strong>, synthesizing data from a network
vulnerability scan, an organizational security questionnaire, and a
review of pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The assessment reveals a notable contrast in the organization’s
security posture. On the technical front, the external network scan of
the target host <code>192.168.1.100</code> showed a strong defensive
configuration, with no open ports detected. This indicates effective
firewalling and a minimal attack surface on the scanned asset.</p>
<p>However, significant administrative and policy-based vulnerabilities
were identified through the security control review. Critical gaps exist
in access control for sensitive data, which is not protected by
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). Furthermore, the absence of a formal
Acceptable Use Policy and a lack of security awareness training for new
employees create a high-risk environment susceptible to insider threats,
social engineering, and policy violations.</p>
<p>Immediate action is required to address these procedural and
policy-related deficiencies to build a more resilient and holistic
security program. Key recommendations focus on implementing MFA for
sensitive systems, developing foundational security policies, and
integrating security training into the employee onboarding process.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An Nmap scan was conducted on the specified target to identify open
ports and running services.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>192.168.1.100</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> UP</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Findings:</strong> The scan concluded that the host is online
but has <strong>no open ports</strong>. All 1000 scanned ports were
found to be in a ’closed’ state. This is a positive security finding,
suggesting that the host is either not running any network services or
is protected by a well-configured firewall that blocks incoming
connections. No vulnerabilities could be identified at the network level
due to this strong defensive posture.</p>
<h1 id="consolidated-risk-assessment">Consolidated Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section correlates findings from the security control review and
technical scan. While no technical vulnerabilities were found, the
administrative gaps present significant risks to the organization. No
pre-existing vulnerabilities were reported.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified
risks and improve the overall security posture of <strong>Aventine
Research</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>[Critical] Implement MFA for Sensitive Data
Access:</strong> Immediately prioritize the deployment and enforcement
of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all applications, databases,
and systems that store or process sensitive organizational or client
data. This is the single most effective control to mitigate the risk of
unauthorized access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>[High] Develop and Enforce an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a comprehensive AUP that clearly defines the
rules and expectations for using company networks, devices, and data.
This policy should be a mandatory part of the employee handbook and all
current and new employees must formally acknowledge it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>[High] Integrate Security Training into
Onboarding:</strong> Establish a mandatory security awareness training
module as part of the new employee onboarding process. This training
should cover key topics such as phishing identification, password
hygiene, data handling, and the new Acceptable Use Policy. This ensures
a baseline of security knowledge from day one.</p></li>
