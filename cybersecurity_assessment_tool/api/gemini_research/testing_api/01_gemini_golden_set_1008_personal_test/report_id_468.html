<h1 id="executive-overview">Executive Overview</h1>
<p>This report provides a cybersecurity posture assessment for
<strong>Binary Star</strong>, based on an analysis of organizational
security controls, technical network scan data, and pre-existing risk
information.</p>
<p>The primary findings indicate several in fundamental security
controls. The lack of mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
email and computer access represents a significant and immediate threat
to the organization. These gaps expose the organization to a high risk
of business email compromise, ransomware attacks, and unauthorized data
access. Furthermore, the absence of a consistent security awareness
training program leaves the organization vulnerable to phishing and
social engineering attacks.</p>
<p>It is critical to note that the provided technical network scan data
(<code>Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON</code>) and the list of current risks
(<code>Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON</code>) were corrupted and could not
be analyzed. This report is therefore based solely on the organizational
questionnaire. A new technical scan is urgently required to gain a
complete picture of the organization’s security posture.</p>
<p>Immediate remediation of the identified control gaps is strongly
recommended to reduce the risk of a significant security incident.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following details were provided for the assessment.</p>

<p>The following table summarizes the organization’s responses to the
security controls questionnaire. Each "No" response indicates a
potential gap in the defensive posture.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<h2 id="data-integrity-issue">Data Integrity Issue</h2>
<p>The provided network scan data file,
<code>Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON</code>, was found to be corrupted or
incomplete. As a result, no analysis of open ports, running services, or
potential software vulnerabilities on the target IP address
(<code>27.150.178.129</code>) could be performed.</p>
<h2 id="implications">Implications</h2>
<p>Without valid scan data, the organization has no visibility into its
external technical attack surface. Vulnerabilities such as unpatched
software, insecure service configurations, or exposed management
interfaces may exist and are currently untracked.</p>
<h2 id="recommendation">Recommendation</h2>
<p>It is imperative to conduct a new, comprehensive, and authenticated
vulnerability scan of the organization’s external and internal networks
as soon as possible.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This assessment is based on the findings from the Security Control
Review. The severity of each risk is rated based on its potential impact
on the organization’s confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The
list of pre-existing risks was unavailable due to a corrupted data file
(<code>Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON</code>).</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following prioritized recommendations are provided to address the
identified risks and improve the overall security posture of
<strong>Binary Star</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="immediate-priority-critical-risks">Immediate Priority (Critical
Risks)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Enforce MFA for Email Access:</strong> Immediately deploy
and mandate the use of Multi-Factor Authentication for all user access
to the email system. This is the single most effective control to
prevent unauthorized account access and business email
compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enforce MFA for Computer Logins:</strong> Implement MFA
for all workstation and server logins. This measure significantly
hardens the internal network against attackers who have compromised user
credentials.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="high-priority">High Priority</h2>
<ol start="3">
<li><p><strong>Establish a Security Awareness Training Program:</strong>
Develop and implement a formal, mandatory security awareness training
program. This program should be required for all new hires and conducted
annually for all staff. Key topics must include phishing identification,
password security, and the acceptable use policy.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="process-improvement">Process Improvement</h2>
<ol start="4">
<li><p><strong>Conduct a New Network Vulnerability Scan:</strong>
Schedule and execute a comprehensive external network vulnerability scan
against the public IP address (<code>27.150.178.129</code>) and any
other external assets. This will identify technical vulnerabilities that
are currently unknown.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Maintain a Formal Risk Register:</strong> Ensure that
known risks and vulnerabilities are tracked in a formal risk register.
The data intended for this assessment
(<code>Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON</code>) was unavailable; a reliable
system must be in place to track and manage risks going
forward.</p></li>
