<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a cybersecurity posture assessment for
<strong>Swift Current Labs</strong>. The analysis is based on a
combination of self-reported organizational data, an external network
scan, and a review of known risks.</p>
<p>The assessment reveals a mixed security posture. On a positive note,
the external network scan of the target IP address () indicated no open
ports, suggesting a well-configured perimeter firewall that effectively
denies unsolicited inbound traffic. The organization also has
foundational policies in place, such as an acceptable use policy and
security training for new hires.</p>
<p>However, several critical security gaps were identified through the
organizational questionnaire. The lack of mandatory Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins represents a
<strong>Critical Risk</strong>. These gaps expose the organization to
significant threats, including business email compromise, credential
theft, and ransomware. Furthermore, the absence of annual security
awareness training for all staff constitutes a <strong>High
Risk</strong>, as it increases susceptibility to phishing and social
engineering attacks.</p>
<p>Immediate remediation should focus on implementing a comprehensive
MFA policy across all critical systems. Concurrently, establishing a
recurring, mandatory security awareness training program for all
employees is essential to mitigate human-factor risks.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-findings">Analysis of
Findings</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA Gaps:</strong> The absence of MFA for email and
computer access is a critical vulnerability. These are primary targets
for attackers seeking to gain initial access to an organization’s
network and data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Training Gaps:</strong> While new employees receive
training, the lack of a mandatory annual refresher course for all staff
leaves the organization vulnerable. Threat landscapes evolve, and
continuous education is necessary to maintain a high level of security
awareness.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed to identify open ports and
exposed services on the provided target system.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> 2026-01-31</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Findings:</strong> The scan reported that all ports were
in a <strong>closed</strong> state. No open ports or active services
were detected.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-findings-1">Analysis of
Findings</h2>
<p>This result is positive. It indicates that the target system is
either not directly exposed to the internet or is protected by a
well-configured firewall that is properly implementing a default-deny
policy for inbound connections. This significantly reduces the external
attack surface.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section correlates the findings from the security control
review, technical scan, and pre-existing risk data to provide a
consolidated view of the current risk landscape. As no pre-existing
vulnerabilities were reported, this assessment is based solely on new
findings.</p>

credential stuffing) grants an attacker direct access to email accounts

initial compromise that could bypass technical controls.</td>

tactics.</p></li>
<li><p>Supplement annual training with periodic phishing simulation
campaigns to measure effectiveness and provide targeted
remediation.</p></li>
