% --- EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ---
\section{Executive Summary}
This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment for Symmetry Architecture, based on network scans, a security controls questionnaire, and a review of existing risk documentation. The analysis reveals a mixed security posture with several critical and high-risk vulnerabilities that require immediate attention.

Key findings indicate that while some controls like Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) are implemented for computer and sensitive system access, there are significant gaps. The most critical vulnerabilities identified are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Exposed Internal Service:} A network service on port 8080 of an internal host (\texttt{10.5.5.5}) is publicly accessible, displaying the title ``TOP SECRET DB''. This represents a severe and immediate data exposure risk. This finding directly contradicts previous risk assessments which incorrectly labeled this port as secure.
    \item \textbf{Lack of Email MFA:} The absence of mandatory MFA for email access leaves the organization highly susceptible to phishing attacks, business email compromise (BEC), and subsequent account takeovers.
    \item \textbf{Policy and Training Deficiencies:} The lack of a formal Acceptable Use Policy and mandatory security training for new hires creates a significant risk from insider threats and human error.
\end{itemize}

This report outlines these findings in detail and provides a prioritized list of actionable recommendations to mitigate the identified risks and strengthen the overall security posture of Symmetry Architecture.

\section{Security Control Review}
The following table summarizes the organization's responses to the security controls questionnaire. Items marked with a \no{} indicate a control gap and are discussed in the Risk Assessment section.

\textbf{Control Question} & \textbf{Response} & \textbf{Analyst Comment} \\ \midrule
Do you require MFA to access email? & \no & \textbf{Critical Gap.} A primary vector for account compromise. \\
Do you require MFA to log into computers? & \yes & Good Practice. \\
Do you require MFA to access sensitive data systems? & \yes & Good Practice. \\
Does your organization have an employee acceptable use policy? & \no & \textbf{High Risk.} Lack of clear guidelines for employees. \\
Does your organization do security awareness training for new employees? & \no & \textbf{High Risk.} New hires are a common target for social engineering. \\
Does your organization do security awareness training for all employees at least once per year? & \yes & Good Practice. \\ \bottomrule

% --- TECHNICAL SCAN RESULTS ---
\section{Technical Scan Results}
An external network scan was performed to identify exposed services and potential vulnerabilities.

\subsection{Host: \texttt{10.5.5.5}}
The scan identified the following open port on the target host. The finding is highly concerning.

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\rowcolors{2}{gray!10}{white}
\begin{tabular}{@{}llll@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Port} & \textbf{State} & \textbf{Service/Script} & \textbf{Details} \\ \midrule
8080/tcp & Open & http-title & \textbf{Title: TOP SECRET DB} \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Open Ports and Services for \texttt{10.5.5.5}}
\label{tab:scan_results}
\end{table}

\paragraph{Analysis:} The presence of an open port with the title ``TOP SECRET DB'' strongly suggests an exposed, and likely unauthorized or misconfigured, database or application interface. This finding directly contradicts the information provided in the existing risk documentation, which stated port 8080 was secure. This discrepancy points to a potential failure in the existing vulnerability management or asset inventory process. This exposure must be investigated and remediated immediately.

% --- RISK ASSESSMENT ---
\section{Risk Assessment}
This section synthesizes findings from the security control review, technical scans, and existing risk data to provide a consolidated view of the current risk landscape.

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{}p{0.3\linewidth}p{0.15\linewidth}p{0.45\linewidth}@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Risk Title} & \textbf{Severity} & \textbf{Description} \\ \midrule
\rowcolor{criticalred!30}
Exposed "TOP SECRET DB" Service & \textbf{Critical} & An internal service on \texttt{10.5.5.5:8080} is exposed, potentially leading to a catastrophic data breach. \\
\rowcolor{criticalred!30}
No MFA for Email Access & \textbf{Critical} & Leaves email accounts vulnerable to takeover via phishing or credential stuffing, enabling business email compromise. \\
\rowcolor{highorange!30}
No Employee Acceptable Use Policy & \textbf{High} & Lack of a formal policy leads to inconsistent security practices and increases the risk of insider threats. \\
\rowcolor{highorange!30}
No Security Training for New Hires & \textbf{High} & New employees are not equipped to identify or respond to security threats, making them prime targets for attackers. \\
\rowcolor{infogray!30}
Outdated Risk Assessment Data & \textbf{Informational} & The existing risk assessment incorrectly states port 8080 is secure, indicating a flaw in the risk management lifecycle. \\ \bottomrule

% --- RECOMMENDATIONS ---
\section{Recommendations}
The following prioritized recommendations are provided to address the identified risks.

\subsection{Immediate Priority (Critical Risks)}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Investigate and Secure Port 8080:} Immediately investigate the service running on \texttt{10.5.5.5:8080}.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Determine the owner and purpose of the service.
        \item If the service is not business-critical, shut it down.
        \item If it is required, place it behind a firewall, restrict access to authorized personnel only, and enforce strong authentication.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Implement MFA for Email:} Enforce mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all email accounts immediately. This is the single most effective control to prevent account takeovers.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{High Priority Recommendations}
\begin{enumerate}
    \setcounter{enumi}{2} % Continue numbering
    \item \textbf{Develop an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):} Create and enforce a formal AUP that clearly defines rules for the use of company assets, data handling, and internet usage. All employees must read and acknowledge this policy.
    \item \textbf{Implement New Hire Security Training:} Integrate a mandatory security awareness training module into the onboarding process for all new employees. This should cover key topics like phishing, password security, and the AUP.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Medium Priority Recommendations}
\begin{enumerate}
    \setcounter{enumi}{4} % Continue numbering
    \item \textbf{Review Vulnerability Management Process:} Conduct a thorough review of the current vulnerability scanning and risk assessment processes to understand why the exposed service on port 8080 was previously misclassified. Implement corrective actions to ensure scan data is accurate and regularly reviewed.
\end{enumerate}
