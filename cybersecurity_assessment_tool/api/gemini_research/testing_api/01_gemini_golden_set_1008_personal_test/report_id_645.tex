% --- Section 1: Executive Summary ---
\section{Executive Summary}
This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the cybersecurity posture of Opal Sky Media, based on a combination of technical network scanning, a review of organizational security controls, and an assessment of pre-existing risk documentation.

The analysis revealed several critical and high-risk findings that require immediate attention. A key discovery from the technical scan was an openly accessible internal service on port 8080, titled \textbf{"TOP SECRET DB"}. This finding directly contradicts existing risk documentation which incorrectly classified this port as a secure false positive. This discrepancy points to a potential failure in the current risk validation process.

Furthermore, the organizational security control review identified a complete lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical systems, including email, computer logins, and access to sensitive data. This absence of a fundamental security control, combined with gaps in employee security training, creates a high-risk environment susceptible to credential theft and unauthorized access.

Immediate remediation is required to address the exposed internal service and to implement foundational security controls like MFA to mitigate the significant risks identified.

% --- Section 2: Organizational Information ---
\section{Organizational Information}
The following details were provided for the assessment.
\begin{table}[h!]

\begin{tabular}{@{}ll@{}}

\textbf{Attribute} & \textbf{Value} \\ \midrule
Organization Name & Opal Sky Media \\
Email Domain & \texttt{OpalSkyMedia.net} \\

% --- Section 3: Security Control Review ---
\section{Security Control Review}
A review of the organization's self-reported security controls was conducted. The findings below highlight significant gaps in access control and employee training policies. A \textcolor{green}{\ding{51}} indicates a positive control, while a \textcolor{red}{\ding{55}} indicates a gap.

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{}p{0.6\linewidth}cp{0.25\linewidth}@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Control Question} & \textbf{Response} & \textbf{Analyst Notes} \\ \midrule
Do you require MFA to access email? & \textcolor{red}{\ding{55}} & \textbf{Critical Gap.} Increases risk of business email compromise. \\
Do you require MFA to log into computers? & \textcolor{red}{\ding{55}} & \textbf{High Risk.} Weakens endpoint security and facilitates lateral movement. \\
Do you require MFA to access sensitive data systems? & \textcolor{red}{\ding{55}} & \textbf{Critical Gap.} Exposes sensitive data to unauthorized access. \\
Does your organization have an employee acceptable use policy? & \textcolor{green}{\ding{51}} & Foundational policy is in place. \\
Does your organization do security awareness training for new employees? & \textcolor{red}{\ding{55}} & \textbf{High Risk.} New hires are a primary target for social engineering. \\
Does your organization do security awareness training for all employees at least once per year? & \textcolor{green}{\ding{51}} & Good practice for maintaining security awareness. \\ \bottomrule

% --- Section 4: Technical Scan Results ---
\section{Technical Scan Results}
An Nmap scan was performed on the internal network host \texttt{10.5.5.5} to identify open ports and running services. The scan revealed a critical finding that requires immediate investigation.

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{}llll@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Host IP} & \textbf{Port} & \textbf{State} & \textbf{Service / Title} \\ \midrule
\texttt{10.5.5.5} & 8080/tcp & Open & HTTP Service Title: \textbf{TOP SECRET DB} \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Nmap Scan Findings for Target Host.}
\label{tab:nmap}
\end{table}

\subsection*{Analysis of Technical Findings}
The scan identified an open HTTP service on port 8080. The service's title, "TOP SECRET DB," strongly suggests it is an internal, non-public system containing highly sensitive data. Its accessibility on the network without apparent authentication controls presents a severe risk of data exposure.

\textbf{Crucially, this finding invalidates a pre-existing risk assessment} (\textit{Input\_3\_Current\_Risks\_JSON}) which stated, "Port 8080 is confirmed secure and false positive." This indicates a flawed risk management or validation process.

% --- Section 5: Risk Assessment & Correlation ---
\section{Risk Assessment \& Correlation}
The following risks have been identified by correlating the technical scan results with the organizational control gaps. These risks supersede any previous assessments related to the affected elements.

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{}p{0.1\linewidth}p{0.2\linewidth}p{0.5\linewidth}l@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{ID} & \textbf{Risk Title} & \textbf{Description} & \textbf{Severity} \\ \midrule
\textbf{R-01} & Critically Exposed Internal Database & An internal service on \texttt{10.5.5.5:8080} titled "TOP SECRET DB" is openly accessible, posing an immediate threat of a major data breach. & \textcolor{criticalred}{\textbf{Critical}} \\
\textbf{R-02} & Systemic Lack of MFA & The absence of MFA for email, computers, and sensitive systems makes the organization highly vulnerable to account takeover and credential-based attacks. & \textcolor{criticalred}{\textbf{Critical}} \\
\textbf{R-03} & Inadequate Onboarding Security & New employees do not receive security awareness training, leaving a critical gap in the human firewall and increasing susceptibility to phishing. & \textcolor{highorange}{\textbf{High}} \\
\textbf{R-04} & Flawed Risk Management Process & A critical exposure on port 8080 was previously misclassified as a secure false positive, indicating a failure in the risk validation and management lifecycle. & \textcolor{highorange}{\textbf{High}} \\ \bottomrule

% --- Section 6: Recommendations ---
\section{Recommendations}
The following actionable steps are recommended to mitigate the identified risks. Recommendations are prioritized based on severity and potential impact.

\subsection*{Immediate Actions (To be completed within 72 hours)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{[R-01] Investigate and Isolate Exposed Database:} Immediately investigate the service running on \texttt{10.5.5.5:8080}. Determine the nature of the data and apply firewall rules to restrict all unauthorized access.
    \item \textbf{[R-02] Enforce MFA on Critical Services:} Begin the emergency rollout of MFA for all administrative accounts and external-facing services, with the highest priority on email (\texttt{OpalSkyMedia.net}).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Short-Term Actions (To be completed within 30 days)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{[R-01] Secure Database Application:} Implement robust authentication, authorization, and encryption for the application on port 8080. If it is a legacy system, it must be contained within a secure, isolated network segment.
    \item \textbf{[R-02] Expand MFA Coverage:} Complete the rollout of MFA for all employees to access sensitive data systems and for computer logins.
    \item \textbf{[R-03] Implement Onboarding Training:} Develop and mandate a security awareness training module for all new hires as a standard part of the onboarding process.
    \item \textbf{[R-04] Review Risk Management Procedures:} Invalidate the previous risk assessment for port 8080. Conduct a full review of the risk assessment and validation process to ensure all findings are technically verified before closure.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Long-Term Actions (Strategic Initiatives)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{[R-01] Network Segmentation Review:} Conduct a comprehensive review of the internal network architecture to ensure proper segmentation between production, development, and corporate environments.
    \item \textbf{[R-04] Continuous Monitoring:} Implement a continuous monitoring and vulnerability scanning solution to proactively identify and manage risks, preventing misconfigurations from going undetected.
\end{itemize}
