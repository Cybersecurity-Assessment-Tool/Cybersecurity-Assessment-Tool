<h1 id="executive-overview">Executive Overview</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment conducted for Borealis Tech. The assessment combined an
analysis of organizational security controls, an external network
vulnerability scan, and a review of known risks.</p>
<h4 id="key-findings">Key Findings:</h4>
<p>The overall security posture of Borealis Tech presents a mixed
profile. On one hand, the external network perimeter is exceptionally
secure, with no open ports or services detected on the scanned target IP
address. This indicates a strong firewall configuration and a minimal
attack surface exposed to the public internet.</p>
<h4 id="section"></h4>
<p>On the other hand, a critical gap was identified in the employee
onboarding process. The lack of mandatory security awareness training
for new hires constitutes a <strong>High</strong> risk. New employees
are often prime targets for social engineering attacks, and this gap
leaves the organization vulnerable to phishing, credential theft, and
other human-centered threats during a critical window of time.</p>
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion:</h4>
<p>While technical controls at the network edge are robust, the
organization must prioritize addressing the identified gap in its
security awareness program to mitigate significant human-related risks.
Recommendations are provided to strengthen this area and maintain the
current high standard of network security.</p>

<p>A review of organizational security controls was conducted based on a
standardized questionnaire. The responses are summarized below. A
checkmark () indicates a positive control is in place, while a cross ()
indicates a potential gap.</p>

</table>
<h4 id="analysis">Analysis:</h4>
<p>The organization has implemented strong identity and access
management controls, with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) widely
enforced. However, the failure to provide security awareness training to
new employees upon hiring is a significant vulnerability. While annual
training is conducted, the initial employment period is when staff are
most susceptible to attacks and unfamiliar with corporate security
policies. This gap is the primary finding from the control review.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed to identify open ports,
running services, and potential vulnerabilities on the public-facing
infrastructure.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> 2026-01-31</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="scan-summary">Scan Summary</h2>
<p>The scan of the target IP address revealed <strong>no open TCP or UDP
ports</strong>. All connection attempts were either filtered or dropped,
indicating that a firewall or similar security device is effectively
blocking unsolicited inbound traffic.</p>
<h2 id="analysis-1">Analysis</h2>
<p>This is an excellent security posture from an external network
perspective. A host with no exposed services presents a minimal attack
surface to external adversaries. This result suggests that the
organization’s network perimeter security is well-configured and
effectively enforced. It is crucial to maintain this configuration and
ensure that any future changes to firewall rules are carefully vetted
through a formal change control process.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes findings from the security control review,
technical scans, and pre-existing risk data. The following table details
the identified risks to Borealis Tech, prioritized by severity.</p>

window of vulnerability where new staff are more susceptible to social
engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) before they are familiar with

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the findings of this assessment, the following actions are
recommended to enhance the cybersecurity posture of Borealis Tech.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>[High Priority] Implement Mandatory Onboarding Security
Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop and integrate a mandatory
security awareness training module into the new employee onboarding
process.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Details:</strong> This training should be completed
within the first week of employment and cover essential topics such as
phishing identification, password security, acceptable use of company
assets, and procedures for reporting security incidents. This directly
mitigates the risk identified as RISK-001.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>[Good Practice] Maintain and Validate Network Perimeter
Security:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Continue the current practice of
maintaining a restrictive firewall policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Details:</strong> Conduct periodic, automated external
vulnerability scans (at least quarterly) to validate that no new
services have been inadvertently exposed. Ensure a formal change
management process is in place for all firewall rule
modifications.</p></li>
</ul></li>
