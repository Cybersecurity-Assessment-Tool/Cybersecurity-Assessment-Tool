<h1 id="executive-overview">Executive Overview</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment conducted for <strong>Green Sprout Organic</strong>. The
assessment combined a review of organizational security controls, an
external network scan, and an analysis of pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The assessment identified several critical and high-risk security
gaps that require immediate attention. The most urgent issues are the
absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for both email and
sensitive data systems. These gaps expose the organization to
significant risks of account compromise and data breaches.</p>
<p>Furthermore, technical analysis revealed that the primary external
web server is running an outdated version of Nginx (1.18.0), which is no
longer receiving security patches and is susceptible to known
vulnerabilities. Finally, a procedural gap was noted in the security
awareness training program, which is not conducted annually for all
employees, increasing the organization’s susceptibility to social
engineering attacks.</p>
<p>This report provides a detailed breakdown of these findings and
offers actionable recommendations to mitigate the identified risks and
strengthen the overall security posture of <strong>Green Sprout
Organic</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following details were provided for the assessment:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Organization Name:</strong> Green Sprout Organic</p></li>

</ul>
<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A review of internal security controls was conducted based on a
standardized questionnaire. The results highlight critical gaps in
access control and employee training policies. A "No" answer indicates a
deviation from security best practices.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed to identify open ports and
exposed services on the organization’s perimeter.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-and-observations">Analysis and Observations</h2>
<p>The scan identified one primary service exposed to the internet: an
Nginx web server on port 443 (HTTPS).</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Outdated Software:</strong> The detected Nginx version is
<strong>1.18.0</strong>, which was released in April 2020. This version
is significantly outdated and no longer receives security updates from
the developer. It is highly likely to be vulnerable to numerous publicly
disclosed exploits. This represents a high-risk finding.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Certificate Mismatch:</strong> The SSL certificate’s
Common Name is listed as <code>www.acme-corp.com</code>, which does not
match the organization’s domain. This could indicate a misconfiguration,
a test environment exposed to the internet, or a shared hosting
environment.</p></li>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified
risks and improve the organization’s security posture.</p>
<h2 id="remediate-risk-001-enforce-mfa-for-email">Remediate RISK-001:
Enforce MFA for Email</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediately enable and enforce
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all user accounts on the
organization’s email platform (e.g., Microsoft 365, Google
Workspace).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> <strong>Critical</strong>. This should
be addressed within 7 days.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="remediate-risk-002-enforce-mfa-for-sensitive-systems">Remediate
RISK-002: Enforce MFA for Sensitive Systems</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Conduct an inventory of all systems
containing sensitive data. Prioritize these systems and implement MFA
for all user and administrative access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> <strong>Critical</strong>. This should
be addressed within 30 days.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="remediate-risk-003-upgrade-web-server-software">Remediate
RISK-003: Upgrade Web Server Software</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Plan and execute an upgrade of the Nginx
server from version 1.18.0 to the latest stable version. Before
deployment, test the new version in a staging environment to ensure
application compatibility.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> <strong>High</strong>. This should be
addressed within 30 days.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="remediate-risk-004-implement-annual-security-training">Remediate
RISK-004: Implement Annual Security Training</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Establish a mandatory annual security
awareness training program for all employees. The training should cover
current threats such as phishing, ransomware, and proper data
handling.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> <strong>High</strong>. A program
should be selected and scheduled within 60 days.</p></li>
