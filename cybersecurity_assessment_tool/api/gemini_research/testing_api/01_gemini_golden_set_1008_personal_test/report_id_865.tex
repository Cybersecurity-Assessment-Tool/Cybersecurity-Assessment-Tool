% --- Executive Summary ---
\section{Executive Summary}
This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture assessment conducted for \textbf{Cinder \& Ash}. The assessment combined a review of organizational security controls, an external network vulnerability scan, and an analysis of pre-existing risks.

The overall security posture reveals significant gaps that expose the organization to a high level of risk. While foundational controls like Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email are in place, critical systems and user endpoints lack this protection. Furthermore, the absence of an Acceptable Use Policy and a recurring security awareness training program weakens the human element of the security framework.

The external network scan identified a public-facing web server running an outdated version of Nginx (1.18.0), which is known to have multiple vulnerabilities. This, combined with the identified policy and procedure gaps, creates a substantial attack surface.

Immediate remediation is recommended, focusing on implementing comprehensive MFA, updating vulnerable software, and establishing formal security policies and training programs to mitigate the identified risks.

\section{Security Control Review}
A review of organizational security controls was conducted based on a standardized questionnaire. The results highlight critical areas requiring immediate attention. "No" answers indicate a significant gap in the security framework.

% --- Technical Scan Results ---
\section{Technical Scan Results}
An external network scan was performed on \textbf{November 22, 2025}, targeting the public-facing IP address \texttt{192.168.10.5}. The scan identified the following open ports and services.

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{}lllll@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Port} & \textbf{State} & \textbf{Service} & \textbf{Product} & \textbf{Version} \\ \midrule
443/tcp & Open & https & nginx & 1.18.0 \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Open Ports and Services Detected}
\label{tab:scan_results}
\end{table}

\subsection*{Analysis of Findings}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Outdated Web Server:} The scan identified Nginx version \texttt{1.18.0}, which was released in April 2020. This version is significantly outdated and is no longer supported. It is known to be vulnerable to multiple security threats, including but not limited to CVE-2021-23017. Running unsupported software on a public-facing server presents a critical risk.
    \item \textbf{SSL Certificate Mismatch:} The SSL certificate presented by the server has a Common Name of \texttt{www.acme-corp.com}, which does not match the organization's domain (\texttt{www.CinderAsh.org}). This misconfiguration can cause trust errors for users and may indicate improper server setup.
\end{itemize}

% --- Risk Assessment ---
\section{Risk Assessment}
The following table synthesizes findings from the security control review and the technical scan. Each risk is assigned a severity level based on its potential impact and likelihood of exploitation.

\begin{table}[h!]

\textbf{Risk Name} & \textbf{Severity} & \textbf{Source} \\ \midrule

% --- Recommendations ---
\section{Recommendations}
Based on the identified risks, the following prioritized actions are recommended to improve the cybersecurity posture of \textbf{Cinder \& Ash}.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Implement Comprehensive MFA (Critical):}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Immediately enforce MFA for all access to systems containing sensitive data.
        \item Roll out mandatory MFA for all employee computer and remote access logins. This single control significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access from compromised credentials.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Upgrade Web Server Software (High):}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Plan and execute an upgrade of the Nginx server from version \texttt{1.18.0} to the latest stable version.
        \item Implement a patch management policy to ensure all public-facing systems are regularly updated.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Develop and Implement Security Policies (High):}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Create a formal Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) that defines the rules for using company assets and data.
        \item Ensure all employees read and acknowledge the AUP upon hiring and annually thereafter.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Establish Annual Security Training (High):}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Institute a mandatory security awareness training program for all employees, to be completed at least once per year.
        \item Training should cover topics such as phishing, password security, and the new Acceptable Use Policy.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Correct SSL Certificate Configuration (Medium):}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Replace the current SSL certificate on the web server with a valid certificate that matches the organization's domain, \texttt{www.CinderAsh.org}.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
