<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a cybersecurity assessment for <strong>Falcon
Heavy</strong>, based on an analysis of network scan data,
organizational security controls, and known risks. The assessment was
conducted on 2026-01-31.</p>
<p>The key findings indicate a mixed security posture. On a positive
note, the external network scan of the target asset revealed a strong
defensive configuration, with no open ports detected. This suggests a
well-configured firewall, which significantly minimizes the external
network attack surface.</p>
<p>However, the review of organizational security controls uncovered
several critical administrative and procedural gaps. The most
significant risks stem from the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) on employee computers, the absence of a formal Acceptable Use
Policy (AUP), and the failure to provide annual security awareness
training for all staff. These deficiencies expose the organization to
substantial risks, including unauthorized access, insider threats, and
susceptibility to social engineering attacks like phishing.</p>
<p>Urgent action is recommended to address these policy and procedural
weaknesses to build a more resilient and comprehensive security
posture.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed to identify open ports and
exposed services on the target system.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>192.168.1.100</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> Up</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Summary:</strong> The scan confirmed that the host
is online but found <strong>no open ports</strong>. All 1000 scanned
ports were reported as "closed".</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>This is a strong positive finding. A host with no externally
accessible ports presents a minimal attack surface to network-based
threats. This indicates that a network or host-based firewall is
effectively configured to block all unsolicited incoming traffic. No
immediate technical vulnerabilities were identified from this scan.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified
risks and improve the overall security posture of <strong>Falcon
Heavy</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Endpoint MFA:</strong> Deploy and enforce
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all employee computer logins. This
is one of the most effective controls for preventing unauthorized access
resulting from compromised credentials.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Evaluate and roll out an MFA solution
compatible with your operating systems (e.g., Windows Hello for
Business, Duo Security, Okta).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a formal AUP that clearly defines the rules and
responsibilities for all users of company IT assets. This policy is a
foundational component of a security program.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Draft an AUP covering topics such as
data handling, internet usage, personal device use, and password
security. Require all employees to read and formally acknowledge the
policy.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish a Continuous Security Training
Program:</strong> Institute a mandatory, annual security awareness
training program for all employees. Regular training ensures that
security remains a top-of-mind concern and that staff are aware of the
latest threats.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Select a training platform or develop a
curriculum that covers phishing, password hygiene, social engineering,
and incident reporting. Track completion for all employees.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The assessment of <strong>Falcon Heavy</strong> reveals a security
posture with notable strengths and critical weaknesses. The technical
configuration of the scanned asset is robust, effectively minimizing its
network attack surface. However, this technical strength is undermined
by significant gaps in fundamental administrative controls. The lack of
endpoint MFA, a formal AUP, and annual security training represent
urgent risks that must be addressed. By implementing the recommendations
outlined in this report, the organization can significantly enhance its
resilience against common cyber threats.</p>
