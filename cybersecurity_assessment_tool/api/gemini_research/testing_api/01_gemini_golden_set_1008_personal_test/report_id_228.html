<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a cybersecurity posture assessment for New Era,
based on an analysis of organizational data and a security controls
questionnaire. A technical network scan and a review of pre-existing
risks were intended to be part of this assessment; however, the data
provided for these sections was corrupted and could not be processed.
This data integrity issue is a significant finding and prevents a full
technical evaluation.</p>
<p>The analysis of the available data reveals <strong>critical
deficiencies</strong> in foundational security controls. The complete
absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all key
systems—including email, computer logins, and sensitive data
access—exposes the organization to a high risk of account compromise and
unauthorized access.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the lack of a formal security awareness training program
for both new and existing employees creates a significant vulnerability
to social engineering and phishing attacks. While an acceptable use
policy is in place, its effectiveness is severely diminished without
corresponding employee education.</p>
<p>Based on these findings, New Era’s current security posture is
assessed as <strong>High Risk</strong>. Immediate remediation is
required to address the identified gaps in identity and access
management and security culture. It is also imperative to conduct a new,
successful network scan to identify and address potential technical
vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>A security questionnaire was completed to evaluate the implementation
of key administrative and technical controls. The responses are
summarized below. A green checkmark (<span style="color: green"></span>)
indicates a positive control, while a red cross (<span

<h2 id="analysis-of-control-gaps">Analysis of Control Gaps</h2>
<p>The questionnaire reveals critical weaknesses in two primary
domains:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Identity and Access Management:</strong> The lack of MFA
is the most severe finding. User credentials (username and password) are
highly susceptible to theft via phishing, malware, or credential
stuffing attacks. Without a second factor of authentication, compromised
credentials directly translate to unauthorized access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Security Culture and Awareness:</strong> The absence of a
structured training program leaves employees, the "human firewall,"
unequipped to recognize and respond to modern cyber threats. This makes
the organization highly vulnerable to phishing, business email
compromise (BEC), and ransomware delivery.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p><strong>Status: Data Not Available.</strong></p>
<p>The input data file for the external network scan
(<code>Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON</code>) was found to be corrupted or
incomplete. As a result, no analysis of open ports, running services, or
potential software vulnerabilities could be performed.</p>
<p>A comprehensive external network scan is a fundamental component of
understanding an organization’s attack surface. Without this data, there
is no visibility into potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited
by external attackers.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This risk assessment is based exclusively on the findings from the
Security Control Review. The list of pre-existing risks
(<code>Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON</code>) was also unavailable due to
data corruption. The following new risks have been identified.</p>
