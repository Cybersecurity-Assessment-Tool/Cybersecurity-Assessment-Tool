\section{Executive Summary}

This report provides a cybersecurity posture assessment for \textbf{North Star Education}, based on a review of organizational security controls, an external network scan, and an analysis of pre-existing risks.

The assessment reveals a mixed security posture. The organization has implemented several key security controls, including Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer and sensitive data access, and maintains a security awareness training program. The external network scan of the target IP address \texttt{[Target IP]} did not identify any open ports or exposed services, which is a positive indicator of a strong network perimeter defense.

However, a critical security gap was identified: \textbf{the lack of mandatory MFA for accessing email accounts}. Email is a primary vector for sophisticated attacks such as Business Email Compromise (BEC), phishing, and credential theft. This single vulnerability significantly increases the organization's risk profile and exposes it to potential account takeovers and subsequent data breaches.

Immediate remediation of the email MFA gap is the highest priority recommendation. Addressing this issue will substantially improve the organization's resilience against common and impactful cyber threats.

\section{Organizational Information}

The following details were provided for the assessment.

\begin{tabular}{@{}ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Attribute} & \textbf{Value} \\
\midrule
Organization Name & North Star Education \\
Email Domain      & \texttt{NorthStarEducation.net} \\
Website Domain    & \url{www.NorthStarEducation.net} \\
External IP       & \texttt{101.188.205.243} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}

% --- 3. Security Control Review ---
\section{Security Control Review}

A review of foundational security controls was conducted based on a questionnaire. The results indicate a generally positive adoption of security policies, with one critical exception highlighted below.

\begin{tabular}{@{}p{0.8\linewidth}c}
\toprule
\textbf{Control Question} & \textbf{Response} \\
\midrule
Does your organization have an employee acceptable use policy? & \ding{51} \\
Does your organization do security awareness training for new employees? & \ding{51} \\
Does your organization do security awareness training for all employees at least once per year? & \ding{51} \\
Do you require MFA to log into computers? & \ding{51} \\
Do you require MFA to access sensitive data systems? & \ding{51} \\
\midrule
\textbf{Do you require MFA to access email?} & \textbf{\textcolor{critical}{\ding{55}}} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}

\vspace{1em}
\noindent
\textbf{Analysis:} The absence of MFA on the primary communication platform (\texttt{NorthStarEducation.net}) represents a critical vulnerability. An attacker with valid credentials (e.g., obtained via phishing or a password leak) can gain full access to an employee's mailbox, enabling data exfiltration, internal phishing campaigns, and financial fraud.

% --- 4. Technical Scan Results ---
\section{Technical Scan Results}

An external network vulnerability scan was conducted to identify exposed services and potential weaknesses on the organization's network perimeter.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Target IP Address:} \texttt{[Target IP]}
    \item \textbf{Scan Date:} \today
    \item \textbf{Finding:} The scan completed successfully and \textbf{did not detect any open ports or running services}.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\textbf{Analysis:} This result is a strong positive finding. It suggests that a well-configured firewall or network access control list is in place, effectively blocking unsolicited external connections. This practice, known as "default deny," significantly reduces the attack surface available to external threat actors. While this is commendable, it does not preclude vulnerabilities in web applications hosted behind a proxy or risks originating from internal or phishing-based attacks.

% --- 5. Risk Assessment Summary ---
\section{Risk Assessment Summary}

This section synthesizes findings from the security control review, technical scan, and pre-existing risk data. The primary identified risk is detailed below. No pre-existing vulnerabilities were reported for this assessment.

\toprule
\textbf{Risk ID} & \textbf{Description} & \textbf{Severity} & \textbf{Recommendation} \\
\midrule
\textbf{RISK-001} & Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on the corporate email system. This allows an attacker with stolen credentials to gain unauthorized access to mailboxes. & \textbf{\textcolor{critical}{Critical}} & Implement and enforce MFA for all user accounts on the \texttt{NorthStarEducation.net} email platform immediately. \\

% --- 6. Recommendations ---
\section{Recommendations}

Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified risks and improve the overall security posture of \textbf{North Star Education}.

\subsection{Priority 1 (Critical)}

\subsubsection{Implement MFA for All Email Accounts}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Risk Addressed:} RISK-001
    \item \textbf{Action:} Immediately begin the process of enabling and enforcing MFA for all user accounts accessing the \texttt{NorthStarEducation.net} email system.
    \item \textbf{Justification:} Email is the top target for cyberattacks. MFA provides a critical second layer of defense that protects accounts even if passwords are stolen, effectively neutralizing the risk of phishing, credential stuffing, and Business Email Compromise (BEC).
    \item \textbf{Next Steps:}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Evaluate and select an MFA solution compatible with your email provider (e.g., authenticator apps like Google/Microsoft Authenticator, hardware tokens, or SMS).
        \item Develop a communication and rollout plan for all employees.
        \item Configure the email system to enforce MFA for all users by a set deadline.
        \item Provide clear instructions and support to staff during the transition.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Priority 2 (Informational)}

\subsubsection{Validate Firewall Configuration}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Risk Addressed:} Proactive Defense Validation
    \item \textbf{Action:} Internally review and validate that the current firewall configuration for the scanned IP (\texttt{[Target IP]}) aligns with organizational policy.
    \item \textbf{Justification:} The external scan showed no open ports, which is excellent. This recommendation serves as a due diligence step to ensure this secure state is intentional and not the result of a misconfiguration or network outage at the time of the scan.
    \item \textbf{Next Steps:}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Have the network or security team review the active firewall rule set for the external perimeter.
        \item Confirm that only necessary, explicitly-defined traffic is permitted.
        \item Document the review and schedule periodic re-validations.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

% --- 7. Conclusion ---
\section{Conclusion}

\textbf{North Star Education} has established a solid foundation for its cybersecurity program, evidenced by its security awareness training and the implementation of MFA on key systems. The secure external network posture is another significant strength.

However, the absence of MFA on email presents a severe and immediate threat that undermines these other security efforts. We strongly urge the organization to prioritize the implementation of email MFA to close this critical gap. By doing so, \textbf{North Star Education} will dramatically enhance its defense against the most prevalent forms of cyberattacks and protect its sensitive communications and data.
