<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a cybersecurity assessment for Fable &amp; Lore,
based on an analysis of organizational security controls, technical scan
data, and pre-existing risk information. The objective is to identify
security gaps, assess their potential impact, and provide actionable
recommendations for remediation.</p>
<h4 id="key-findings">Key Findings:</h4>
<p>The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to identity and
access management, with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) consistently
enforced across email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. This
significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access via compromised
credentials.</p>
<p>However, a critical gap was identified in the employee onboarding
process: <strong>new hires do not receive mandatory security awareness
training</strong>. This oversight exposes the organization to a high
risk of social engineering, phishing attacks, and unintentional security
breaches, as new employees are often prime targets for malicious
actors.</p>
<h4 id="data-limitations">Data Limitations:</h4>
<p>It is crucial to note that the technical network scan data
(<code>Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON</code>) and the list of current
organizational risks (<code>Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON</code>) were
found to be corrupted and could not be processed. Consequently, this
assessment is primarily based on the security questionnaire and cannot
provide insights into potential vulnerabilities in external-facing
services or correlate findings with previously identified risks.</p>
<h4 id="primary-recommendation">Primary Recommendation:</h4>
<p>The most urgent recommendation is to implement a mandatory security
awareness training program for all new employees as part of their
standard onboarding procedure. This single measure will substantially
strengthen the organization’s human firewall and mitigate a significant
vector of attack.</p>

<h1 id="security-control-review-questionnaire-analysis">Security Control
Review (Questionnaire Analysis)</h1>
<p>The following table summarizes the organization’s responses to the
security controls questionnaire. The analysis highlights a strong
foundation in access control but reveals a critical weakness in security
training.</p>

</table>
<h4 id="analysis">Analysis:</h4>
<p>The consistent implementation of MFA is commendable and serves as a
robust defense against account takeover attacks. The existence of an
acceptable use policy and annual training for existing staff are also
positive indicators of a maturing security program.</p>
<p>The single "No" response is a significant finding. The absence of
security training during the onboarding phase leaves the organization
vulnerable. New employees are unfamiliar with corporate policies and are
more susceptible to social engineering tactics. This gap undermines the
effectiveness of other security controls.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>The data file intended to contain the results of the network scan
against the target IP address (<code>[Target IP]</code>) was found to be
corrupted or incomplete.</p>

<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section details the risks identified during this assessment. Due
to corrupted input data, pre-existing risks could not be included or
correlated. The primary risk identified stems directly from the security
control review.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following prioritized recommendations are provided to address the
findings of this report.</p>
<h2
id="priority-1-high-implement-mandatory-onboarding-security-training">Priority
1 (High): Implement Mandatory Onboarding Security Training</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop or procure a security awareness
training module that is a mandatory component of the new-hire onboarding
process. This training should be completed before a new employee is
granted access to sensitive data or systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> This directly mitigates the
highest-rated risk (R-001) by equipping new staff with the knowledge to
recognize and report threats. It is a cost-effective measure that
significantly reduces the likelihood of a breach caused by human
error.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2
id="priority-2-medium-re-run-technical-infrastructure-scans">Priority 2
(Medium): Re-run Technical Infrastructure Scans</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Schedule and execute a new,
authenticated and unauthenticated network vulnerability scan against the
organization’s external IP (<code>186.247.131.87</code>) and other
critical assets.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> The corrupted scan data creates a
critical visibility gap. A successful scan is essential to identify
outdated software, insecure configurations, and other technical
vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="priority-3-medium-restore-and-review-risk-register">Priority 3
(Medium): Restore and Review Risk Register</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Investigate the cause of the data
corruption for the existing risk register
(<code>Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON</code>) and restore the information
from a valid backup.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> A complete and up-to-date risk
register is a cornerstone of an effective risk management program. It is
necessary for tracking vulnerabilities, prioritizing remediation
efforts, and demonstrating due diligence.</p></li>
