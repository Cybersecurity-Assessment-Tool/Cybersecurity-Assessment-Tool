<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>The overall security posture of Hidden Gem presents a mixed
landscape. The organization demonstrates a solid foundation in several
key areas, including security awareness training, acceptable use
policies, and the enforcement of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
computer and sensitive data system access. Furthermore, the technical
network scan of the target host <code>192.168.1.100</code> revealed no
open ports, indicating a strong firewall configuration and a hardened
external perimeter for that specific asset.</p>
<p>However, a critical vulnerability was identified: the lack of
mandatory MFA for accessing email. This gap represents a significant and
immediate threat to the organization. Email is a primary vector for
sophisticated attacks such as Business Email Compromise (BEC), phishing,
and account takeovers. Without the protection of MFA, a single
compromised password could grant an attacker access to sensitive
communications, data, and a trusted platform from which to launch
further attacks against employees, partners, and clients.</p>
<p>This report strongly recommends the immediate implementation and
enforcement of MFA across all email accounts as the top priority for
risk mitigation.</p>

<p>The primary finding from this review is the absence of MFA for email.
This is a critical control failure, as email systems are high-value
targets for attackers.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed to identify open ports and
exposed services on the specified target.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>192.168.1.100</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> Up</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Key Finding:</strong> The scan confirmed that the host is
online, but no open ports were detected. All 1000 scanned ports were in
a ’closed’ state.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> This result is highly positive. It
indicates that the target system is properly firewalled and does not
expose any unnecessary services to the network, significantly reducing
its attack surface. This is a commendable security practice.</p>
<h1 id="consolidated-risk-assessment">Consolidated Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes findings from the security questionnaire,
technical scans, and pre-existing risk data. Based on the available
inputs, no pre-existing vulnerabilities were reported. The primary risk
identified is a direct result of the security control gap.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To enhance the organization’s security posture, the following actions
are recommended, prioritized by severity.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>[Critical] Enforce MFA for All Email
Accounts:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediately enable and enforce MFA for
all user accounts on the <code>HiddenGem.net</code> email
platform.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> This is the single most effective
control to prevent unauthorized access to email accounts. It mitigates
the risk of password-based attacks and protects against Business Email
Compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Prioritize the use of strong MFA
methods such as authenticator apps (e.g., Google Authenticator,
Microsoft Authenticator) or FIDO2-compliant hardware security keys over
less secure methods like SMS.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>[High] Maintain Strong Network Security:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Continue the practice of maintaining a
default-deny firewall policy and minimizing the external attack surface,
as demonstrated by the scan results for
<code>192.168.1.100</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> The current configuration is a
significant strength. Regular reviews and vulnerability scanning should
be performed to ensure this posture is maintained across all
external-facing assets.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Hidden Gem has successfully implemented several important security
controls, including robust employee training programs and MFA for key
systems. The secure network configuration of the scanned host is also a
notable strength. However, the security posture is critically undermined
by the lack of MFA on its email system. Addressing this single
vulnerability should be the organization’s top cybersecurity priority.
By enforcing MFA for email, Hidden Gem will dramatically reduce its risk
of significant financial and reputational damage from cyberattacks.</p>
