<h1 id="executive-overview">Executive Overview</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the cybersecurity
posture for <strong>Radiant Life</strong>, based on a review of
organizational security controls, an external network scan, and a
summary of known risks. The assessment was conducted on 2026-01-31.</p>
<p>Overall, <strong>Radiant Life</strong> demonstrates a solid
foundation in security practices, including the implementation of
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer access, and a
consistent security awareness training program. The external network
scan of the provided target IP address revealed no open ports,
indicating a well-hardened perimeter at that specific point.</p>
<p>However, a critical security gap was identified: the absence of MFA
for accessing sensitive data systems. This represents a significant
risk, as it exposes the organization’s most valuable data to potential
compromise through stolen or weak credentials. This report details this
finding and provides actionable recommendations to mitigate the
identified risk and further strengthen the organization’s security
posture.</p>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A review of administrative and policy-based security controls was
conducted via a questionnaire. The results are summarized below. A green
checkmark (<span style="color: green"></span>) indicates a positive
control is in place, while a red ’X’ (<span style="color: red"></span>)
highlights a potential security gap.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>The questionnaire reveals a strong commitment to security
fundamentals. However, the lack of MFA on sensitive data systems is a
critical weakness. While email and endpoint security are robust, the
organization’s "crown jewels" are not protected with the same level of
assurance. This gap must be addressed with high priority.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed using Nmap to identify open ports and
services on the designated target.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>192.168.1.100</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Status:</strong> Host is up.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="findings">Findings</h2>
<p>The scan concluded that there were <strong>no open ports</strong> on
the target host. All 1000 scanned ports were reported as ‘closed‘. This
is a positive security finding, as it indicates that the host has a
minimal attack surface from the scanner’s perspective. This could be due
to a properly configured firewall or a lack of network-facing services
on the machine.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section correlates findings from the security control review,
technical scans, and pre-existing risk data. Based on the available
inputs, one high-severity risk has been identified.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following recommendations are provided to mitigate the identified
risks and improve the overall security posture of <strong>Radiant
Life</strong>.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="risk-001-implement-mfa-for-sensitive-systems-high-priority">RISK-001:
Implement MFA for Sensitive Systems (High Priority)</h2>
<p>It is strongly recommended that the organization immediately begin
planning and implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all
systems that store, process, or transmit sensitive data.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Identify all sensitive data repositories
and the applications used to access them.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Evaluate and deploy an enterprise-grade
MFA solution that is compatible with these systems. Solutions can
include authenticator apps (TOTP), hardware tokens, or
biometrics.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> This action directly mitigates
the risk of unauthorized access through credential theft, phishing, or
password reuse. It is one of the most effective controls for protecting
critical assets.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="maintain-network-hardening-good-practice">Maintain Network Hardening
(Good Practice)</h2>
<p>The network scan results for the target IP were positive. This
practice should be continued and expanded.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Continue to enforce the principle of
least privilege for network services, ensuring that only necessary ports
are open to required networks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Implement a regular, automated scanning
schedule for all external-facing and critical internal IP addresses to
promptly identify and remediate any unauthorized changes or newly opened
ports.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> Proactive network monitoring
ensures that the organization’s attack surface remains minimal and that
misconfigurations are detected quickly.</p></li>
