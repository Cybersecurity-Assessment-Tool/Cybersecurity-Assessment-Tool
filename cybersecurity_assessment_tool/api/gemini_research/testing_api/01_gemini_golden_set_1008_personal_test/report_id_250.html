<p><strong>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</strong></p>
<p>Prepared for:<br />
<strong>Calyx Botany</strong></p>
<p>Date of Report: 2026-01-31</p>
<p><em>This report contains sensitive information and should be handled
with care. Access is restricted to authorized personnel only.</em></p>
</div>
<h1 id="executive-overview">Executive Overview</h1>
<p>This report provides a cybersecurity assessment for <strong>Calyx
Botany</strong>, based on an analysis of organizational security
controls, a technical network scan, and a review of pre-existing risks.
The objective is to identify security gaps, assess their potential
impact, and provide actionable recommendations to enhance the
organization’s security posture.</p>
<p>The assessment revealed several critical gaps in foundational
security controls. The most significant risks stem from the lack of
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer access, and the
absence of a recurring, annual security awareness training program for
all staff. These weaknesses expose the organization to a high risk of
account compromise, data breaches, and social engineering attacks.</p>
<p>The external technical scan of the target host
<code>[Target IP]</code> did not identify any open ports. While this
suggests a potentially strong firewall configuration, it does not
preclude vulnerabilities in web applications or other services that may
be proxied or otherwise protected. The primary focus for remediation
should be on the identified administrative and procedural control
gaps.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following details were provided for the assessment scope.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Organization Name:</strong> Calyx Botany</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Email Domain:</strong>
<code>CalyxBotany.org</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Website Domain:</strong> <a href="www.CalyxBotany.org"
class="uri">www.CalyxBotany.org</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>External IP Scanned:</strong>
<code>55.130.194.125</code></p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A review of organizational security controls was conducted via a
standardized questionnaire. The responses are summarized below,
highlighting areas that align with best practices and those that
represent significant security gaps. A green checkmark () indicates a
positive control, while a red ’X’ () indicates a missing control that
increases risk.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed on the designated target IP
address to identify open ports and exposed services.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP:</strong> <code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> 2026-01-31</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="scan-summary">Scan Summary</h2>
<p>The network scan did not detect any open TCP or UDP ports on the
target host. This result typically indicates one of the following
scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The host is protected by a well-configured firewall that blocks
all unsolicited incoming traffic (network egress filtering).</p></li>
<li><p>The host was offline or unreachable at the time of the
scan.</p></li>
<li><p>There are no network services running on the host that are
accessible from the public internet.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>While no immediate vulnerabilities were discovered from this scan,
the lack of open ports does not guarantee security. The primary risks
identified in this assessment are related to the organizational controls
detailed in Section 3.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes findings from the security control review
and technical scan to identify and prioritize key risks. No pre-existing
vulnerabilities were reported. The following risks have been identified
based on the current assessment.</p>

<td style="text-align: left;">Without a second authentication factor,

Login</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The absence of MFA on computer logins
means that a compromised password is all an attacker needs for access.
This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to devices
that are lost, stolen, or targeted remotely.</td>

<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Inadequate Security Awareness
Training</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Without mandatory, annual security
training, employees’ awareness of current threats diminishes. This makes
the organization more susceptible to social engineering, phishing, and
malware infections initiated by user error.</td>

</div>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the risks identified in Section 5, the following prioritized
recommendations are provided to strengthen the security posture of
<strong>Calyx Botany</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>[Critical] Implement MFA for Email:</strong> Immediately
enforce MFA for all user accounts on the <code>CalyxBotany.org</code>
email platform. This is the single most effective control to prevent
email account takeovers and should be the top priority.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>[High] Enforce MFA for Endpoint Logins:</strong> Deploy
MFA for all company computer and laptop logins (e.g., Windows Hello,
YubiKey, Duo). This adds a critical layer of defense against
unauthorized access resulting from stolen credentials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>[High] Establish an Annual Security Training
Program:</strong> Develop and mandate a formal security awareness
training program for all employees to be completed at least once per
year. The training should cover current threats such as phishing,
ransomware, and proper data handling to foster a security-conscious
culture.</p></li>
