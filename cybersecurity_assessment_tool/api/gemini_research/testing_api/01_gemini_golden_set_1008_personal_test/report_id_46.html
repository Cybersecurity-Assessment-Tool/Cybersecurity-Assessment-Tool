<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for <strong>New Era</strong>, based on a review of organizational
security controls, an external network scan, and an analysis of
pre-existing risks. The assessment synthesizes information from a
security questionnaire, a network port scan, and a list of current
vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>The overall security posture of the organization is moderately
strong, with excellent implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) across key systems and a secure external network perimeter. The
external scan of the target IP address <code>[Target IP]</code> revealed
no open ports, indicating a well-configured firewall.</p>
<p>However, a critical gap was identified in the employee onboarding
process. The lack of mandatory security awareness training for new hires
represents a <strong>High</strong> risk. New employees are a primary
target for social engineering and phishing attacks, and this gap leaves
the organization vulnerable from an employee’s first day until the next
annual training cycle.</p>
<p>Immediate action is recommended to implement a security training
module into the standard onboarding process to mitigate this risk and
strengthen the organization’s human firewall.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following details were provided for the assessment. This
information forms the basis of the scope and context for the
analysis.</p>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A review of administrative and policy-based security controls was
conducted via a questionnaire. The responses indicate a strong
commitment to identity and access management but highlight a significant
weakness in security training for new personnel.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-controls">Analysis of
Controls</h2>
<p>The organization has successfully implemented MFA across critical
access points, which significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
access from compromised credentials. The existence of an acceptable use
policy and annual security training are also positive indicators of a
maturing security program.</p>
<p>The key finding from this review is the <strong>absence of security
awareness training during employee onboarding</strong>. This is a
critical vulnerability. Threat actors often target new employees who may
not yet be familiar with company security policies or common attack
vectors. This gap creates a window of high susceptibility to phishing
and social engineering attacks.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was conducted to identify exposed services
and potential vulnerabilities on the organization’s perimeter.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not provided in scan data.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="findings">Findings</h2>
<p>The scan completed successfully and found <strong>no open TCP or UDP
ports</strong> on the target system.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="interpretation">Interpretation</h2>
<p>This result is positive and suggests a strong firewall configuration
is in place for the scanned IP address. A "default deny" firewall
posture, where all unsolicited inbound traffic is blocked, is a security
best practice. This configuration drastically reduces the external
attack surface and prevents unauthorized access to internal systems.
While this could also indicate the host was offline, it is more likely a
sign of a properly secured network perimeter.</p>
<h1 id="consolidated-risk-assessment">Consolidated Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes findings from the security control review,
technical scan, and any pre-existing risks. The primary risk identified
during this assessment is related to a procedural gap in the employee
lifecycle. No pre-existing vulnerabilities were provided for this
assessment.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the consolidated risk assessment, the following actionable
recommendations are provided to enhance the cybersecurity posture of
<strong>New Era</strong>.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="recommendation-1-implement-onboarding-security-training-high-priority">Recommendation
1: Implement Onboarding Security Training (High Priority)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop and integrate a mandatory
security awareness training module into the standard new employee
onboarding process. This training should be completed within the first
week of employment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Details:</strong> The training module should cover, at a
minimum:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Phishing and social engineering awareness (how to spot and report
suspicious emails).</p></li>
<li><p>Password security and MFA policy.</p></li>
<li><p>The company’s Acceptable Use Policy (AUP).</p></li>
<li><p>Safe handling of sensitive company and client data.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> This action directly mitigates
the highest-rated risk identified in this report. By educating employees
from day one, the organization can significantly reduce its
susceptibility to human-targeted attacks and build a stronger security
culture.</p></li>
