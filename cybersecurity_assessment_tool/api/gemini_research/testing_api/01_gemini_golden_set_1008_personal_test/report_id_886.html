<h1 id="executive-overview">Executive Overview</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment for <strong>Vivid Vision</strong>. The assessment
incorporated a review of organizational security controls via a
questionnaire, an external network vulnerability scan, and an analysis
of pre-existing risks.</p>
<h4 id="key-findings">Key Findings:</h4>
<p>The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to identity and
access management, with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) consistently
enforced across email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. The
external network scan of the target IP address,
<code>[Target IP]</code>, revealed no open ports or exposed services,
indicating a robust network perimeter.</p>
<h4 id="identified-gaps">Identified Gaps:</h4>
<p>Despite these strengths, two significant administrative control gaps
were identified. The absence of a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP) and the lack of mandatory security awareness training for new
hires present high-risk vulnerabilities. These gaps expose the
organization to insider threats, social engineering, and potential
non-compliance with regulatory standards.</p>
<h4 id="overall-posture">Overall Posture:</h4>
<p><strong>Vivid Vision</strong> has a solid technical security
foundation but requires immediate attention to formalize its
administrative and procedural controls. Addressing the identified policy
and training gaps is critical to mitigating human-centric risks and
maturing the overall security program.</p>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A review of internal security controls was conducted based on a
questionnaire. The responses highlight areas of both strength and
weakness in the current security posture. "No" answers indicate critical
gaps that require remediation.</p>

</div>
<h4 id="analysis">Analysis:</h4>
<p>The consistent implementation of MFA is commendable and significantly
reduces the risk of unauthorized access. However, the lack of an
Acceptable Use Policy and security training for new hires are critical
deficiencies. New employees are a primary target for attackers, and
without immediate training, they represent a significant vulnerability
from their first day.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed to identify potential
vulnerabilities in internet-facing systems.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> 2026-01-31</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Summary:</strong> The scan completed successfully and did
not identify any open TCP or UDP ports on the target system.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion:</h4>
<p>This result is highly positive. It suggests that the organization’s
firewall and network perimeter security controls are effectively
configured to prevent unauthorized external access, adhering to the
principle of least privilege by not exposing any unnecessary services to
the internet.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section consolidates risks identified from the security control
review, technical scan, and any pre-existing vulnerability data. No
pre-existing risks were reported, and no technical vulnerabilities were
discovered during the scan. The primary risks are administrative in
nature.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actionable recommendations are provided to address the
identified risks and strengthen the organization’s overall security
posture.</p>
<h2 id="develop-and-implement-an-acceptable-use-policy-aup">Develop and
Implement an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Draft a comprehensive AUP that clearly
defines the rules and responsibilities for all employees when using
company technology and data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Details:</strong> The policy should cover topics such as
data classification and handling, password security, internet and email
usage, use of personal devices (BYOD), and procedures for reporting
security incidents.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implementation:</strong> The AUP should be formally
approved by management, distributed to all current employees for review
and acknowledgment, and integrated into the new hire onboarding
process.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Risk Mitigated:</strong> RISK-001</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="establish-a-new-hire-security-onboarding-program">Establish a
New Hire Security Onboarding Program</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Create a mandatory security awareness
training module that all new employees must complete as part of their
onboarding process.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Details:</strong> This initial training should provide a
foundational understanding of critical security topics, including
phishing identification, social engineering tactics, MFA importance, and
a thorough review of the newly created AUP.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implementation:</strong> This program should be a
prerequisite for gaining full access to corporate systems. It will
supplement the existing annual training program by ensuring a secure
baseline for all personnel from day one.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Risk Mitigated:</strong> RISK-002</p></li>
