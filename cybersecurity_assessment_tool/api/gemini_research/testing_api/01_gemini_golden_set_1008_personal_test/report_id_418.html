<h1 id="executive-overview">Executive Overview</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment conducted for <strong>True Grit</strong>. The assessment
combined a review of organizational security controls via a
questionnaire, an external network vulnerability scan, and an analysis
of pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The external network scan against the target IP address
<code>[Target IP]</code> revealed <strong>no open ports or exposed
services</strong>. This is a positive finding and indicates a strong
perimeter security posture, likely due to a well-configured firewall
that denies unsolicited inbound traffic.</p>
<p>However, the organizational security control review identified
several significant policy and procedural gaps that present a high level
of risk. The most critical findings include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Critical Risk:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
is not enforced for accessing sensitive data systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>High Risk:</strong> The organization lacks a formal
employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>High Risk:</strong> New employees do not receive
mandatory security awareness training during their onboarding
process.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>While the technical perimeter appears secure, these internal control
deficiencies expose the organization to significant threats, including
unauthorized data access, insider threats, and social engineering
attacks. Immediate remediation of these policy-based risks is strongly
recommended.</p>

<p>A review of internal security controls was conducted based on a
standardized questionnaire. The responses indicate key areas where
security practices are strong and where they are critically deficient. A
indicates an affirmative response (control in place), while a indicates
a negative response (control gap).</p>

this report.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed to identify open ports and
exposed services on the organization’s perimeter.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> 2026-01-31</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="summary-of-findings">Summary of Findings</h2>
<p>The network scan completed successfully and found <strong>no open TCP
or UDP ports</strong> on the target system. This result suggests that
the external network perimeter is well-secured, with a firewall likely
configured to drop or reject all unsolicited incoming traffic. This is a
strong security practice that significantly reduces the external attack
surface. No vulnerabilities were identified as no services were
exposed.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes findings from the security control review,
technical scan, and pre-existing risk data. No pre-existing
vulnerabilities were reported. The primary risks identified are related
to internal policies and procedures.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified
risks and improve the overall security posture of <strong>True
Grit</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="remediation-for-lack-of-mfa-critical">Remediation for Lack of
MFA (Critical)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediately develop a plan to implement
and enforce MFA across all systems, databases, and applications that
store, process, or transmit sensitive organizational or customer
data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> This should be the highest priority
remediation effort.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Details:</strong> Prioritize systems based on data
criticality. Communicate the upcoming change to all affected users and
provide clear instructions for enrollment.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="remediation-for-missing-aup-high">Remediation for Missing AUP
(High)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop and ratify a comprehensive
Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> High. This is a foundational
governance document.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Details:</strong> The policy should clearly define rules
for computer, network, email, and internet usage. It must be distributed
to all current employees for review and acknowledgment, and integrated
into the new hire onboarding process.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="remediation-for-new-hire-training-gap-high">Remediation for New
Hire Training Gap (High)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Integrate a mandatory security awareness
training module into the new employee onboarding process.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> High. This closes a critical window of
vulnerability.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Details:</strong> The training should cover essential
topics such as phishing identification, password security, data
handling, and the newly created AUP. This will ensure a baseline level
of security awareness from day one.</p></li>
