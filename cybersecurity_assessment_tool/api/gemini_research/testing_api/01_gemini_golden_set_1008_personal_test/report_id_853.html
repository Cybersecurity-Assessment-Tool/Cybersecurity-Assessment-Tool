<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for Modern Myth, based on a combination of network scanning,
organizational data review, and an analysis of current risks. The
assessment was conducted on November 22, 2025.</p>
<p>The analysis revealed several high-priority security gaps that
require immediate attention. A critical vulnerability was identified on
the public-facing web server, which is running a significantly outdated
and unsupported version of nginx. This exposes the organization to
numerous publicly known exploits.</p>
<p>Furthermore, critical procedural gaps were identified, most notably
the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access, which is
a primary vector for account compromise and business email compromise
(BEC) attacks. Another significant finding is the absence of security
awareness training for new employees, leaving the organization
vulnerable to social engineering attacks during the critical onboarding
period.</p>
<p>This report details these findings and provides actionable
recommendations to mitigate the identified risks and strengthen the
overall security posture of the organization.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following information was provided for the assessment.</p>

</ul>
<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A review of the organization’s security controls was conducted via a
questionnaire. The responses indicate key areas where security practices
are strong and where they are critically lacking. A "No" response
indicates a potential security gap that increases organizational
risk.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-control-gaps">Analysis of Control
Gaps</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>No MFA for Email:</strong> This is a
<strong>Critical</strong> gap. Email is a primary target for attackers
seeking to gain initial access, conduct phishing campaigns, or execute
Business Email Compromise (BEC) attacks. The absence of MFA
significantly lowers the barrier for an attacker to compromise an
account.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Security Training for New Employees:</strong> This is
a <strong>High</strong> risk. New hires are often targeted by social
engineering attacks as they are less familiar with company policies and
security procedures. Failing to provide training during onboarding
creates a recurring window of vulnerability.</p></li>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of
Technical Findings</h2>
<p>The scan identified a web server running <strong>nginx version
1.18.0</strong>. This version was released in April 2020 and is now
considered outdated and unsupported. It is known to be vulnerable to
multiple Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), including but not
limited to request smuggling and memory disclosure issues (e.g.,
CVE-2021-23017). Running outdated software on a public-facing service
presents a <strong>Critical</strong> risk of compromise, as automated
attack tools constantly scan for and exploit such vulnerabilities.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the risk assessment, the following actions are recommended
to mitigate the identified vulnerabilities and improve the overall
security posture. Recommendations are prioritized by severity.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>[Critical] Enforce MFA for All Email
Accounts:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediately enable and enforce MFA for
all user accounts across the <code>ModernMyth.net</code> email
domain.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Drastically reduces the risk of email
account compromise, even if user credentials are stolen.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>[Critical] Upgrade Web Server Software:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Plan and execute an upgrade of the nginx
server from version 1.18.0 to the latest stable version. A patch
management process should be implemented to ensure software is kept
up-to-date.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Mitigates numerous publicly known
vulnerabilities, protecting the server and its data from
compromise.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>[High] Implement New Employee Security
Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Integrate a mandatory security awareness
training module into the new employee onboarding process. This training
should cover topics such as phishing, acceptable use, and password
security.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Reduces the human-factor risk by
equipping new staff with the knowledge to identify and report security
threats from their first day.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The assessment for Modern Myth has identified critical and
high-severity risks that require immediate remediation. The combination
of a vulnerable public-facing server and weak access controls for email
creates a significant attack surface. By implementing the
recommendations outlined in this report—specifically enforcing MFA,
upgrading outdated software, and formalizing security training—Modern
Myth can substantially reduce its risk exposure and build a more
resilient security foundation.</p>
