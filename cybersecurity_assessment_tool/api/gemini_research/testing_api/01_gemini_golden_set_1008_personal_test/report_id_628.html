<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment conducted for Silver Leaf Collective. The assessment combined
a review of organizational security controls via a questionnaire with a
technical network scan of a designated target system.</p>
<p>Overall, the assessment identified a mixed security posture. The
technical scan of the target host <code>192.168.1.100</code> revealed a
strong network configuration, with no open ports detected. This suggests
effective firewalling and a minimal attack surface for that specific
asset.</p>
<p>However, the security control review uncovered two significant policy
and procedural gaps that present a high level of risk to the
organization:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Critical Risk:</strong> The absence of Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) on systems containing sensitive data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>High Risk:</strong> The lack of mandatory security
awareness training for new employees during their onboarding
process.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This report provides a detailed analysis of these findings and offers
prioritized, actionable recommendations to mitigate the identified risks
and enhance the overall security posture of Silver Leaf Collective.</p>

<p>A review of internal security controls was conducted based on a
standardized questionnaire. The responses indicate areas of both
strength and weakness in the organization’s security policies and
procedures. Gaps identified with a “No” response are addressed in the
Risk Assessment section.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed to identify open ports and exposed
services on the specified target system.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>192.168.1.100</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> 2026-01-31</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="findings">Findings</h2>
<p>The scan concluded that the host was online, but reported
<strong>zero open ports</strong>. All 1000 scanned ports were in a
“closed” state.</p>
<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>This result indicates a very strong security posture for the scanned
host from a network perspective. It suggests that the host is either
protected by a well-configured firewall that denies all incoming
traffic, or it is not running any network-facing services. This
configuration significantly reduces the external attack surface of this
specific asset.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes the findings from the security control
review and technical scan to identify and prioritize key risks to the
organization. While the technical scan was clean, significant risks were
identified through the questionnaire. No pre-existing vulnerabilities
were reported.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actionable recommendations are provided to address the
identified risks. They are prioritized based on severity.</p>
<h2 id="priority-1-implement-mfa-on-sensitive-systems-critical">Priority
1: Implement MFA on Sensitive Systems (Critical)</h2>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediately begin the process of identifying
all systems that store, process, or transmit sensitive organizational or
client data. Procure and implement a robust Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) solution for access to these systems.<br />
<strong>Justification:</strong> This is the single most effective
control to prevent unauthorized access resulting from compromised
credentials. It directly mitigates the risk of a data breach.</p>
<h2 id="priority-2-establish-new-hire-security-training-high">Priority
2: Establish New Hire Security Training (High)</h2>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop and mandate a security awareness
training module as a required part of the new employee onboarding
process. This training should be completed within the first week of
employment.<br />
<strong>Justification:</strong> Educating employees from day one about
security threats like phishing, malware, and proper data handling
significantly reduces the organization’s susceptibility to human-centric
attacks. It closes a critical vulnerability window for new, and often
targeted, staff members.</p>
