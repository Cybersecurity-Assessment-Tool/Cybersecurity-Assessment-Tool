<p><strong>Cybersecurity Posture Assessment Report</strong></p>

<h1 id="executive-overview">Executive Overview</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the cybersecurity
posture for <strong>Echo Chamber Arts</strong>, based on a synthesis of
technical network scans, a security controls questionnaire, and a review
of pre-existing risk data. The assessment was conducted to identify
vulnerabilities, policy gaps, and areas for security enhancement.</p>
<h4 id="key-findings">Key Findings:</h4>
<p>The assessment revealed a mixed security posture. While the
organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
computer and sensitive data access, several critical and high-risk gaps
were identified:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Critical Risk - No MFA on Email:</strong> The lack of
mandatory MFA for email access represents the most significant threat,
exposing the organization to account takeovers and business email
compromise (BEC) attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>High Risk - Policy Gaps:</strong> The absence of an
employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and a recurring annual security
awareness training program creates significant organizational risk from
both a compliance and operational security standpoint.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Risk Remediation Noted:</strong> A previously identified
risk concerning an unencrypted web server on Port 80 appears to have
been remediated. Our latest network scan found Port 80 to be
<code>closed</code> on the target system, contradicting the prior risk
data.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="overall-assessment">Overall Assessment:</h4>
<p>The organization’s proactive stance on MFA for internal systems is
commendable. However, the identified gaps in email security and
foundational governance policies must be addressed urgently to mitigate
substantial risks. This report provides prioritized, actionable
recommendations to strengthen the overall security posture.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following details were provided for the assessment. This
information helps to establish the context and scope of the review.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed to identify active services and
potential technical vulnerabilities on the specified target system.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="nmap-scan-of">Nmap Scan of </h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> 2026-01-31</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Target IP:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> Up</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The scan results indicate no open ports on the target host. This is a
positive security finding, as it minimizes the external attack
surface.</p>

<h4 id="analysis">Analysis:</h4>
<p>The scan shows that Port 80 (HTTP) is closed. This finding directly
contradicts a pre-existing risk entry ("Unencrypted Web Server") which
stated this port was open. This suggests that the risk has been
successfully remediated or was a false positive in a previous
assessment.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actionable recommendations are prioritized based on the
severity of the identified risks.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="priority-1-critical-remediate-r-01">Priority
1 (Critical): Remediate R-01</h2>
<h4 id="action-enforce-mfa-for-all-email-accounts">Action: Enforce MFA
for All Email Accounts</h4>
<p>Immediately configure the organization’s email service (e.g.,
Microsoft 365, Google Workspace) to require Multi-Factor Authentication
for all user accounts. This single action provides the most significant
improvement to the organization’s security posture.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> Protects against credential
theft, phishing, and account takeovers, which are the root cause of most
modern cyberattacks.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="priority-2-high-remediate-r-02-r-03">Priority
2 (High): Remediate R-02 &amp; R-03</h2>
<h4
id="action-develop-and-implement-foundational-security-policies">Action:
Develop and Implement Foundational Security Policies</h4>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Create an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> Draft and
implement an AUP that clearly defines the rules for using company
technology, data, and network resources. Require all employees to read
and acknowledge the policy. Templates are available from sources like
the SANS Institute.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish an Annual Security Awareness Program:</strong>
Implement a mandatory security awareness training program for all
employees to be completed at least once per year. This ensures
continuous education on current threats like phishing, ransomware, and
social engineering.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="priority-3-informational-validate-r-04">Priority 3 (Informational):
Validate R-04</h2>
<h4 id="action-update-and-maintain-risk-register">Action: Update and
Maintain Risk Register</h4>
<p>Formally mark the "Unencrypted Web Server" risk (R-04) as "Resolved"
in the organization’s risk register. Implement a process for
periodically re-validating technical scan results against the risk
register to ensure it remains accurate and up-to-date.</p>
