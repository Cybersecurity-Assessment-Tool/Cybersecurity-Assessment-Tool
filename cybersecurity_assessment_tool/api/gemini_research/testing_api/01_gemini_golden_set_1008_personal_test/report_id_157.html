<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity assessment for
Golden Gate Gaming, conducted on November 22, 2025. The analysis is
based on a network vulnerability scan, a review of organizational
security controls, and an evaluation of pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The assessment reveals a mixed security posture. The organization
demonstrates strong foundational controls, particularly in the mandatory
use of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across email, computer logins,
and sensitive data systems. These measures significantly reduce the risk
of unauthorized access through compromised credentials.</p>
<p>However, two critical areas of concern were identified that require
immediate attention:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Outdated Web Server Software:</strong> The
external-facing web server at <code>192.168.10.5</code> is running Nginx
version 1.18.0, which is outdated and no longer receives security
updates. This exposes the server to numerous publicly known
vulnerabilities, posing a high risk of compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inadequate Security Training Cadence:</strong> While new
employees receive security awareness training, there is no program for
mandatory, annual refresher training for all staff. This gap creates a
significant human-element risk, as employees may not be aware of
evolving threats like sophisticated phishing and social engineering
tactics.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This report details these findings and provides actionable
recommendations to mitigate the identified risks and enhance the overall
security posture of Golden Gate Gaming.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and improve the organization’s
security posture, the following actions are recommended.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade Outdated Nginx Server (Risk R-01):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Plan and execute an upgrade of the Nginx
server on host from version 1.18.0 to the latest stable
version.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> Upgrading patches known
vulnerabilities, protecting the server and its data from
compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Timeline:</strong> Immediate (within 30 days).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Additional Step:</strong> Implement a formal patch
management policy and schedule for all internet-facing systems to
prevent future occurrences of this risk.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Annual Security Awareness Training (Risk
R-02):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Establish a mandatory security awareness
training program that all employees must complete annually.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> Regular training ensures that
employees’ knowledge of cyber threats remains current, reinforcing their
ability to act as a human firewall against attacks. Topics should
include phishing identification, password hygiene, and incident
reporting.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Timeline:</strong> Within 90 days.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Additional Step:</strong> Conduct periodic, unannounced
phishing simulations to test and measure the effectiveness of the
training program.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Golden Gate Gaming has established a solid security foundation with
its comprehensive implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication.
However, the organization’s security is undermined by critical
vulnerabilities in its technical and human layers. The use of outdated
server software and the lack of recurring security training present
clear and immediate risks.</p>
<p>By prioritizing the recommendations outlined in this
report—specifically, upgrading the vulnerable Nginx server and
instituting an annual security training program—Golden Gate Gaming can
significantly reduce its attack surface and build a more resilient and
secure operational environment.</p>
