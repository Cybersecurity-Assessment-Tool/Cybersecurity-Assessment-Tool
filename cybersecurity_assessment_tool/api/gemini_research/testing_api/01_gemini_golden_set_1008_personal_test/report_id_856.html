<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for <strong>Evergreen Alliance</strong>, conducted on 2026-01-31. The
analysis is based on a synthesis of network scan data, an organizational
security controls questionnaire, and a review of pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The assessment reveals a mixed security posture. On one hand, the
technical network scan of the target host (<code>192.168.1.100</code>)
showed a strong defensive configuration, with no open ports detected.
This indicates effective network-level filtering and a minimal attack
surface for that specific asset.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a review of organizational security controls
identified two significant gaps that present a high degree of risk. The
absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins exposes
the organization to account takeover attacks. Furthermore, the lack of a
formal Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) represents a critical governance
deficiency, creating ambiguity for employees and increasing the risk of
insider threats and non-compliance.</p>
<p>While no pre-existing vulnerabilities were documented, the newly
identified control gaps are foundational and require immediate
attention. This report outlines these risks and provides actionable
recommendations to mitigate them and strengthen the organization’s
overall security framework.</p>

<p>A review of the organization’s security controls was conducted via a
questionnaire. The responses indicate the current state of implemented
security policies and procedures. Gaps identified here often represent
significant organizational risk.</p>

<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The organization has successfully
implemented MFA for critical assets like email and sensitive data
systems. However, the lack of MFA for endpoint computer logins and the
absence of an Acceptable Use Policy are critical deficiencies that
undermine the overall security posture.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network port scan was performed to identify accessible services and
potential vulnerabilities on the specified target system.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>192.168.1.100</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Status:</strong> Completed</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="summary-of-findings">Summary of Findings</h2>
<p>The scan results were positive from a security perspective. No open
ports were detected on the target host. All 1000 scanned ports were
reported as being in a <strong>‘closed‘</strong> state.</p>
<h3 id="implications">Implications</h3>
<p>A host with no open ports presents a minimal network attack surface.
This typically indicates one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The host is protected by a well-configured firewall that is
effectively blocking all inbound connection attempts.</p></li>
<li><p>The host is not running any network-facing services.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This is a strong security control and is commended. No further
technical vulnerabilities were identified on this host from this
scan.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section consolidates findings from the security control review,
technical scans, and pre-existing risk data. The following table
summarizes the identified risks, their potential impact, and an assigned
severity level. No pre-existing vulnerabilities were provided for this
assessment.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the findings in this report, the following actions are
recommended to mitigate the identified risks and improve the overall
cybersecurity posture of <strong>Evergreen Alliance</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="high-priority-implement-mfa-for-all-endpoints">High Priority:
Implement MFA for All Endpoints</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Procure and deploy a mandatory MFA
solution for all employee computer and laptop logins. Supported methods
should include authenticator applications (e.g., Google Authenticator,
Microsoft Authenticator), hardware tokens (e.g., YubiKey), or
biometrics.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> Endpoints are a primary target
for attackers. Enforcing MFA at login is one of the most effective
controls to prevent unauthorized access via compromised credentials,
thereby protecting against ransomware and data breaches.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2
id="medium-priority-develop-and-implement-an-acceptable-use-policy">Medium
Priority: Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Draft a comprehensive AUP that clearly
defines the rules and expectations for employees when using company
networks, systems, applications, and data. The policy should be reviewed
by legal counsel, communicated to all staff, and formally acknowledged
via signature.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> An AUP is a foundational
governance document. It establishes a baseline for secure behavior,
reduces organizational liability, and provides a framework for enforcing
security standards.</p></li>
