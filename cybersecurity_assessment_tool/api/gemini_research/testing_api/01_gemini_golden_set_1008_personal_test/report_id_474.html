<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity assessment for
<strong>Astraeus Aerospace</strong>, based on a technical network scan,
a review of organizational security controls, and an analysis of
pre-existing risk data. The assessment was conducted on 2026-01-31.</p>
<p>The organization’s overall security posture is mixed. Foundational
controls such as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins
and an employee acceptable use policy are in place. However, several
critical security gaps were identified that expose the organization to
significant risk.</p>
<p><strong>Key Findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Critical MFA Gaps:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication
is not enforced for accessing email or sensitive data systems. This
represents a critical vulnerability, as compromised credentials could
lead to unauthorized access to confidential communications and critical
business data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Insufficient Security Training:</strong> While new
employees receive security training, there is no mandatory annual
training program for all staff. This gap can lead to a decline in
security awareness over time, making the organization more susceptible
to social engineering and phishing attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Risk Mitigation Confirmed:</strong> A previously
identified risk, "Unencrypted Web Server" on port 80, was not present on
the scanned target (<code>192.168.0.5</code>). The technical scan
confirmed that port 80 is closed on this host, indicating successful
mitigation or a false positive in prior reporting.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Immediate action is required to address the identified MFA and
training deficiencies. Detailed recommendations are provided in Section
<a href="#sec:recommendations" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:recommendations">6</a> to guide remediation efforts
and strengthen the overall security posture of <strong>Astraeus
Aerospace</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-control-gaps">Analysis of Control Gaps</h2>
<p>The lack of enforced MFA on email and sensitive data systems
constitutes a critical risk. Email is a primary vector for phishing and
business email compromise (BEC) attacks. Failure to protect sensitive
data systems with MFA removes a crucial layer of defense against
unauthorized access and data exfiltration. Furthermore, the absence of
annual security awareness training for all employees allows security
knowledge to become stale, increasing the likelihood of human error
leading to a security incident.</p>

<h2 id="scan-analysis">Scan Analysis</h2>
<p>The scan results are positive for the target host. The only port
checked, port 80 (HTTP), was found to be <strong>closed</strong>. This
indicates that the host is not running an unencrypted web server
accessible on the standard port. This finding directly contradicts a
pre-existing risk entry (see Section <a href="#sec:risk"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:risk">5</a>), suggesting
that the risk has been remediated on this specific asset or was
inaccurately reported. No other open ports or vulnerable services were
discovered on this host during the scan.</p>

<h1 id="sec:recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actions are recommended to address the identified risks
and improve the security posture of <strong>Astraeus Aerospace</strong>.
Recommendations are prioritized based on severity.</p>
<h2 id="critical-priority">Critical Priority</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Enforce MFA for Email Access:</strong> Immediately
implement and enforce a policy requiring Multi-Factor Authentication for
all user access to the email system (). This is the single most
effective control to prevent business email compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enforce MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> Identify
all systems containing sensitive, confidential, or proprietary data and
mandate the use of MFA for all user access, including administrative
accounts.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="high-priority">High Priority</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Annual Security Awareness Training:</strong>
Establish a mandatory security awareness training program for all
employees, to be completed annually. The training should cover current
threats such as phishing, social engineering, and proper data
handling.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="verification-and-review">Verification and Review</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Validate Risk Mitigation:</strong> Although the
"Unencrypted Web Server" risk appears mitigated on the scanned host, it
is recommended to perform a broader network scan to ensure no other
systems are exposing an open Port 80. Formally update the organizational
risk register to reflect the mitigated status.</p></li>
