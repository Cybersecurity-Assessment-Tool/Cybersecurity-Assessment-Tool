<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity assessment for
<strong>Binary Star</strong>, based on a correlation of organizational
data, a technical network scan, and a review of existing risks. The
analysis reveals a mixed security posture. While the organization has
implemented some essential controls, such as an acceptable use policy
and annual security training, critical deficiencies were identified.</p>
<p>The most significant risks stem from the lack of Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for email and computer access, and the absence of
security awareness training for new employees. These gaps create
substantial vulnerabilities to credential theft, phishing, and
unauthorized access. A technical scan confirmed an exposed SSH service
on the network, which, when combined with the identified policy gaps,
elevates the risk of a successful brute-force or credential-based
attack.</p>
<p>Immediate remediation is recommended, focusing on the deployment of
MFA and the integration of security training into the employee
onboarding process.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="technical-analysis">Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>The presence of an open SSH port (22) is a notable finding. This
service is commonly used for remote administration but is also a primary
target for automated brute-force attacks. Without strong controls, such
as IP whitelisting, fail2ban, and key-based authentication, this exposed
service presents a direct vector for unauthorized access. This risk is
significantly amplified by the lack of enforced MFA on computer
logins.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes findings from the security control review,
technical scan, and pre-existing risk data. As no pre-existing
vulnerabilities were reported, the following risks are derived entirely
from this assessment.</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="tabular">
<p><span>L<span>3.5cm</span> L<span>8.5cm</span>
C<span>2cm</span></span> <strong>Risk Name</strong> &amp;
<strong>Overview</strong> &amp; <strong>Severity</strong><br />
<strong>Lack of MFA on Critical Systems</strong> &amp; User accounts for
email and computer logins are protected only by passwords. A single
compromised credential could lead to a full account takeover, data
breach, or ransomware deployment. &amp; <strong>High</strong><br />
<strong>No Onboarding Security Training</strong> &amp; New employees are
not provided with security awareness training upon being hired. This
makes them highly susceptible to phishing and social engineering attacks
before they are integrated into the annual training cycle. &amp;
<strong>High</strong><br />
<strong>Exposed SSH Service</strong> &amp; The SSH management port is
open to the public internet, making it a constant target for brute-force
and credential-stuffing attacks. This is exacerbated by the lack of MFA
for computer logins. &amp; Medium<br />

</div>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the identified risks, the following prioritized actions are
recommended to improve the cybersecurity posture of <strong>Binary
Star</strong>.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="high-priority">High Priority</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement and Enforce MFA:</strong> Deploy a robust
Multi-Factor Authentication solution for all employees and contractors.
Enforcement should be prioritized for:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Email access (e.g., Office 365, Google Workspace).</p></li>
<li><p>Endpoint/computer logins (e.g., Windows Hello, Duo).</p></li>
<li><p>VPN and other remote access solutions.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Integrate Security Training into Onboarding:</strong>
Develop and mandate a security awareness training module as a required
step in the new employee onboarding process. This training should occur
within the first week of employment and cover topics such as phishing,
password hygiene, and the acceptable use policy.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="medium-priority">Medium Priority</h2>
<ol start="3">
<li><p><strong>Secure Exposed SSH Service:</strong> Harden the publicly
accessible SSH service to reduce the attack surface. Recommended actions
include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Firewall Rules:</strong> Restrict access to the SSH port
to only known, trusted IP addresses (e.g., administrator office IPs, VPN
subnets).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Disable Password Authentication:</strong> Enforce public
key authentication, which is significantly more resistant to brute-force
attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Intrusion Prevention:</strong> Deploy a tool
like <code>fail2ban</code> to automatically block IP addresses that
exhibit malicious behavior, such as repeated failed login
attempts.</p></li>
</ul></li>
