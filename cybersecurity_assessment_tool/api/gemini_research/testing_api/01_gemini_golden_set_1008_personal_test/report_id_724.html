<h1 id="executive-overview">Executive Overview</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity assessment
conducted for <strong>Silent Spring</strong>. The assessment
incorporated a review of organizational security controls, an external
network scan, and an analysis of pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The overall security posture presents a mixed landscape. On a
technical level, the scanned host (<code>192.168.1.100</code>)
demonstrated a strong network security configuration, with no open ports
detected. This indicates a robust firewall policy that effectively
minimizes the external attack surface for that specific asset.</p>
<p>However, significant gaps were identified in the organization’s
access control and employee training policies. The absence of
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and, most
critically, for access to sensitive data systems, constitutes a
<strong>Critical Risk</strong>. A single compromised password could lead
to unauthorized system access and a potential data breach. Furthermore,
the lack of mandatory security awareness training for new employees
creates a vulnerability, as new hires are often prime targets for social
engineering attacks.</p>
<p>Immediate remediation should focus on implementing MFA across all
critical systems and integrating security training into the employee
onboarding process.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following information was provided for the assessment.</p>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A review of internal security controls was conducted based on a
standardized questionnaire. The responses indicate several areas
requiring immediate attention. A summary of the findings is presented in
Table <a href="#tab:controls" data-reference-type="ref"

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed to identify exposed services and
potential vulnerabilities on the specified target system.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Target:</strong> <code>192.168.1.100</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> [Scan Date]</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="summary-of-findings">Summary of Findings</h2>
<p>The scan revealed that the target host is online and responsive.
However, <strong>no open TCP or UDP ports were discovered</strong>. All
65,535 ports on the target machine were found to be in a ‘closed‘
state.</p>
<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>A host with no open ports is considered to have a very strong network
security posture. This configuration significantly reduces the attack
surface, as there are no listening services (e.g., web servers, remote
access protocols, databases) for an attacker to target from the network.
This finding indicates an effective and well-configured firewall
policy.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes findings from the security control review
and the technical scan. While no pre-existing risks were reported and
the network scan was positive, the policy gaps identified in the
questionnaire introduce significant organizational risks.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the risk assessment, the following prioritized actions are
recommended to enhance the security posture of <strong>Silent
Spring</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="priority-1-critical">Priority 1: Critical</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA on Sensitive Systems:</strong> Immediately
deploy mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication for all user accounts
(including administrative and service accounts) that have access to
systems designated as containing sensitive or critical data.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="priority-2-high">Priority 2: High</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Enforce MFA for Endpoint Logins:</strong> Roll out MFA
for all employee computer logins (e.g., Windows, macOS). This measure
drastically reduces the risk of unauthorized endpoint access via stolen
credentials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop New-Hire Security Training:</strong> Create a
mandatory security awareness training module to be completed by all new
employees during their onboarding process. This training should cover
the acceptable use policy, phishing identification, password hygiene,
and incident reporting procedures.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="priority-3-informational">Priority 3: Informational</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Maintain Strong Firewall Policies:</strong> Continue the
excellent practice of maintaining a default-deny firewall policy for
network assets, as observed on the scanned host. Regularly review and
audit firewall rules to ensure they remain effective.</p></li>
