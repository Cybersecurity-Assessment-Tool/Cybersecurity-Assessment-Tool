<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a cybersecurity assessment for <strong>Calyx
Botany</strong>, based on a review of organizational security controls,
an external network scan, and an analysis of pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The overall assessment reveals a mixed security posture. The
organization has implemented strong foundational technical controls,
particularly in mandating Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across key
systems. The external network scan of the target IP address,
<code>[Target IP]</code>, did not identify any open ports, suggesting a
robust firewall configuration that effectively limits external
exposure.</p>
<p>However, a critical weakness was identified in the area of human
security controls. The organization currently does not provide security
awareness training for new employees during onboarding, nor does it
conduct annual refresher training for all staff. This gap represents a
high-risk vulnerability, as it leaves the organization highly
susceptible to social engineering, phishing attacks, and other
human-vectored threats.</p>
<p>Immediate action is recommended to develop and implement a
comprehensive security awareness training program to mitigate this
significant risk.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following details were provided for the assessment.</p>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A review of administrative and technical security controls was
conducted via a standardized questionnaire. The responses are summarized
below. A checkmark () indicates a positive control is in place, while a
cross () indicates a control gap.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-controls">Analysis of
Controls</h2>
<p>The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to identity and
access management through the consistent enforcement of MFA. The
presence of an acceptable use policy is also a positive finding.
However, the two "No" responses highlight a critical deficiency in the
security program. The lack of both initial and ongoing security
awareness training significantly increases the organization’s risk
profile, as employees are the first line of defense against many common
cyber threats.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network vulnerability scan was performed to identify
exposed services and potential vulnerabilities.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> 2026-01-31</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="findings">Findings</h2>
<p>The scan completed successfully and <strong>did not detect any open
TCP or UDP ports</strong> on the target system. This is a positive
security finding, indicating that the network perimeter firewall is
correctly configured to deny unsolicited inbound traffic, adhering to
the principle of least privilege. While this reduces the external attack
surface, it does not preclude vulnerabilities in web applications or
services that may be proxied through other means.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes findings from the security control review,
technical scan, and any pre-existing known vulnerabilities. Based on the
analysis, the following risks have been identified.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and improve the overall security
posture of <strong>Calyx Botany</strong>, the following actions are
recommended with high priority.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement a New Hire Security Training Program:</strong>
Develop and integrate a mandatory security awareness training module
into the onboarding process for all new employees and contractors. This
training should cover, at a minimum:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Acceptable use of company assets.</p></li>
<li><p>Phishing and social engineering awareness.</p></li>
<li><p>Password security and MFA policies.</p></li>
<li><p>Procedures for reporting security incidents.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish an Annual Security Refresher Program:</strong>
Institute a mandatory, annual security awareness training program for
all employees. This program should be updated regularly to reflect
current threats. To enhance effectiveness, supplement the training with
periodic, unannounced phishing simulation exercises to test and
reinforce employee knowledge.</p></li>
