<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a cybersecurity assessment for Grizzly Peak,
based on data from a network scan, an organizational security
questionnaire, and a review of pre-existing risks. The assessment was
conducted on 2026-01-31.</p>
<p>The analysis reveals a mixed security posture. While the technical
scan of the target host showed no open ports—a positive finding
indicating a potentially well-configured firewall—significant and
critical gaps were identified in the organization’s security
controls.</p>
<p>The most critical findings stem from the complete absence of
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and access
to sensitive data. This deficiency exposes the organization to a high
risk of account compromise and unauthorized access. Furthermore, the
lack of mandatory, annual security awareness training for all employees
exacerbates this risk, as personnel are less prepared to identify and
resist social engineering attacks like phishing.</p>
<p>Immediate and decisive action is required to address these control
gaps. The priority must be the phased implementation of MFA across all
critical systems, followed by the establishment of a comprehensive
security awareness training program.</p>

</div>
<p>The lack of MFA is the most severe finding. Without it, a single
compromised password can lead to a full breach of email, internal
systems, and sensitive data. The absence of annual security awareness
training for all staff leaves the organization vulnerable to phishing
and other social engineering tactics, which are the primary vectors for
credential theft.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed to identify listening services and
potential vulnerabilities on the specified target system.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> 2026-01-31</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Used:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="scan-findings">Scan Findings</h2>
<p>The scan confirmed that the host at was online and responsive.
However, the scan did not detect any open TCP ports. All 1000 scanned
ports were reported as "closed".</p>
<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>This is a positive security finding for the scanned host. It suggests
that the system either has no network services exposed or is protected
by a well-configured firewall that is correctly blocking inbound
connection attempts. This significantly reduces the attack surface of
this specific asset. However, this result applies only to the single IP
scanned and should not be interpreted as representative of the entire
network’s security posture.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified
risks and improve the overall security posture of Grizzly Peak.</p>
<h2
id="priority-1-implement-multi-factor-authentication-critical">Priority
1: Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (Critical)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediately begin a phased rollout of a
strong MFA solution (e.g., authenticator app, hardware token) across the
organization.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scope:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Prioritize email systems (e.g., Office 365, Google Workspace) and
any remote access solutions (e.g., VPN).</p></li>
<li><p>Extend MFA to all systems containing sensitive or critical
business data.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, enforce MFA for all workstation and server
logins.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> This is the single most effective
control to prevent unauthorized access resulting from compromised
credentials.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2
id="priority-2-establish-annual-security-awareness-training-high">Priority
2: Establish Annual Security Awareness Training (High)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop and implement a mandatory
security awareness training program for all employees, to be completed
annually.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scope:</strong> The training should cover key topics such
as phishing identification, password hygiene, acceptable use, and
incident reporting. Supplement the annual training with periodic
simulated phishing campaigns to measure effectiveness.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> A well-trained workforce is a
critical layer of defense, turning a potential vulnerability (human
error) into a security asset.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2
id="priority-3-conduct-comprehensive-vulnerability-scanning-medium">Priority
3: Conduct Comprehensive Vulnerability Scanning (Medium)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Perform a comprehensive, credentialed
vulnerability scan of the internal network and an unauthenticated scan
of the external perimeter.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scope:</strong> This should cover all servers,
workstations, network devices, and external-facing IP
addresses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> The single-host scan provided an
incomplete picture. A comprehensive assessment is necessary to identify
other potential technical vulnerabilities, such as unpatched software or
misconfigurations.</p></li>
