<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a cybersecurity posture assessment for
<strong>Nomad Gear Co.</strong>. The analysis is based on a correlation
of external network scan data, a security controls questionnaire, and a
review of pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The assessment reveals a mixed security posture. On the positive
side, the external network scan of the target IP address
<code>[Target IP]</code> did not identify any open ports, suggesting a
strong firewall configuration and a minimal external attack surface. The
organization also has several key security controls in place, including
mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins,
and access to sensitive systems.</p>
<p>However, a critical procedural gap was identified: the lack of
mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees. This
oversight significantly increases the organization’s susceptibility to
social engineering attacks, such as phishing, which remain one of the
most common vectors for security breaches. This issue is categorized as
a <strong>High</strong> severity risk.</p>
<p>The primary recommendation is to immediately implement a
comprehensive, mandatory annual security awareness training program for
all staff to mitigate this human-centric risk.</p>

<p>The review indicates strong controls in identity and access
management through the enforcement of MFA. However, the lack of
recurring security training for all employees is a significant
weakness.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed to identify open ports and
exposed services.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Data Not Provided</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="scan-findings">Scan Findings</h2>
<p>The network scan completed successfully but found <strong>no open
ports</strong> on the target system. This is a strong security posture,
indicating that a well-configured firewall is in place, effectively
blocking unsolicited inbound traffic and minimizing the external attack
surface. No vulnerabilities related to exposed services could be
identified.</p>

<td style="text-align: left;">While new employees receive training, the
absence of an annual refresher course for all staff leaves the
organization vulnerable. Attack techniques evolve, and employee
awareness diminishes over time. This gap increases the likelihood of a
successful phishing, business email compromise (BEC), or malware attack
originating from human error.</td>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended to
enhance the cybersecurity posture of <strong>Nomad Gear
Co.</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Annual Security Awareness Training
(Critical):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop and mandate an annual security
awareness training program for all employees, including
management.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Details:</strong> The training should cover current
threats such as phishing, ransomware, social engineering, and proper
data handling. The program should include a confirmation of completion
for audit and compliance purposes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Significantly reduces the risk of
security incidents caused by human error and strengthens the
organization’s "human firewall."</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Maintain Strong Network Perimeter Security (Good
Practice):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Continue the current practice of
maintaining a restrictive firewall policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Details:</strong> Regularly review and audit firewall
rules to ensure that only explicitly required ports and services are
accessible from the internet.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Preserves the minimal external attack
surface, protecting internal systems from direct external
threats.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p><strong>Nomad Gear Co.</strong> has established a solid technical
foundation for its external security, as evidenced by the lack of
exposed services on its network perimeter. The enforcement of MFA across
critical systems is also a commendable strength. However, the
organization’s defense is undermined by the absence of ongoing security
education for its staff. By implementing the recommendation to establish
a mandatory annual training program, <strong>Nomad Gear Co.</strong> can
significantly mature its security posture and build a more resilient
defense against modern cyber threats.</p>
