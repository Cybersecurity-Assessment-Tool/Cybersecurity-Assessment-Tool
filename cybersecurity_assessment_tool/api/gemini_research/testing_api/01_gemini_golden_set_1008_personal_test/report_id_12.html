<p><strong>Cybersecurity Posture Assessment Report</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>For: Aetheric Systems</strong></p>
<p>Report Date: 2026-01-31</p>
<p><em>This report is confidential and intended solely for the use of
Aetheric Systems. Distribution without prior consent is
prohibited.</em></p>
</div>
<h1 id="executive-overview">Executive Overview</h1>
<p>This report provides a cybersecurity posture assessment for Aetheric
Systems. The analysis is primarily based on a security controls
questionnaire completed by the organization.</p>
<p>It is critical to note that the provided technical network scan data
and the list of current organizational risks were corrupted and could
not be analyzed. This represents a significant blind spot in the
assessment, and the findings within this report are consequently focused
on procedural and policy-based controls.</p>
<p>The questionnaire revealed several critical and high-risk security
gaps. Most notably, the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
email access and computer logins exposes the organization to a high
likelihood of account compromise and subsequent data breaches.
Furthermore, the absence of an employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and
mandatory security training for new hires indicates foundational
weaknesses in the organization’s security culture and governance.</p>
<p>Immediate remediation of these identified gaps is strongly
recommended to reduce the organization’s attack surface and mitigate the
risk of a significant security incident.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following details were provided by the client for this
assessment.</p>

<h1 id="security-control-review-questionnaire">Security Control Review
(Questionnaire)</h1>
<p>The following table details the organization’s responses to the
security controls questionnaire. Each "No" response indicates a
deviation from security best practices and has been classified as a
security gap.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p><strong>The network scan data (Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON) provided
for the target IP <code>[Target IP]</code> was found to be corrupted and
could not be processed.</strong></p>
<p>A technical analysis of open ports, running services, and potential
software vulnerabilities could not be performed. An external network
scan is a fundamental component of any security assessment, as it
reveals the organization’s direct exposure to internet-based threats.
Without this data, the organization’s external security posture remains
unevaluated.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> It is imperative to conduct a new,
comprehensive network vulnerability scan against the organization’s
external IP addresses, including <code>33.75.1.67</code>, as soon as
possible.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>The following risks have been identified based on the Security
Control Review. This list is not exhaustive due to the unavailability of
technical scan data and pre-existing risk information

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actions are recommended to address the identified
risks. Recommendations are prioritized based on severity and potential
impact.</p>
<h2 id="immediate-priority-critical-risks">Immediate Priority (Critical
Risks)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Deploy MFA for Email and Endpoints (R-001,
R-002):</strong> Immediately enforce Multi-Factor Authentication for all
user accounts across all critical systems.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Prioritize cloud email services (e.g., Microsoft 365, Google
Workspace).</p></li>
<li><p>Implement MFA for all workstation and laptop logins (e.g., via
Windows Hello for Business, Duo, or a similar solution).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Re-conduct Technical Security Scans:</strong> As noted in
Section 4, a new external vulnerability scan must be performed against
the IP address <code>33.75.1.67</code> and any other public-facing
assets to identify technical vulnerabilities.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="high-priority-high-risks">High Priority (High Risks)</h2>
<ol start="3">
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an AUP (R-003):</strong> Draft,
approve, and disseminate a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy. This
policy should clearly define the rules for using company networks,
devices, and data. Require all current and new employees to read and
formally acknowledge the policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Onboarding Security Training (R-004):</strong>
Create a mandatory security awareness training module to be completed by
all new hires during their first week of employment. This training
should cover key topics such as phishing, password security, and the new
AUP.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="general-recommendations">General Recommendations</h2>
<ol start="5">
<li><p><strong>Restore Risk Register:</strong> Attempt to restore or
recreate the organization’s list of known risks to ensure a continuous
and comprehensive risk management program.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Review Security Policies Annually:</strong> The annual
security awareness training for all employees is a good practice. This
should be complemented by an annual review and update of all security
policies, including the new AUP.</p></li>
