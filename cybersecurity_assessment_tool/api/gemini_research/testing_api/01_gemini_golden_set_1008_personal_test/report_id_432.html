<p><strong>Cybersecurity Posture Assessment Report</strong></p>
<p>Prepared for:</p>
<p><strong>Vertex Solutions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Date of Report:</strong> 2026-01-31</p>
<p><em>This report contains sensitive information and is intended solely

</div>
<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a cybersecurity posture assessment for
<strong>Vertex Solutions</strong>, based on a review of organizational
security controls and an analysis of technical scan data. The assessment
aims to identify key security gaps, evaluate existing risks, and provide
actionable recommendations to enhance the organization’s overall
security resilience.</p>
<h4 id="key-findings">Key Findings:</h4>
<p>The analysis revealed several critical and high-risk security gaps
originating from organizational policies. The most significant concerns
are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Critical Risk: Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA):</strong> MFA is not enforced for accessing company email or for
logging into employee computers. This exposes the organization to a high
risk of account compromise, business email compromise (BEC), and
unauthorized access to internal systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>High Risk: Inadequate Security Awareness
Training:</strong> While new employees receive training, there is no
mandatory annual security training for all staff. This leads to a
gradual decay in security awareness, making the organization more
susceptible to evolving threats like phishing and social
engineering.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="data-limitations">Data Limitations:</h4>
<p>It is crucial to note that the provided network scan data
(<code>Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON</code>) and the list of current risks
(<code>Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON</code>) were corrupted and could not
be processed. Consequently, this assessment is based primarily on the
security questionnaire. A comprehensive understanding of the external
attack surface and existing vulnerabilities is not possible without
valid technical data.</p>
<h4 id="overall-posture">Overall Posture:</h4>
<p>While <strong>Vertex Solutions</strong> has foundational security
controls in place, such as an acceptable use policy and MFA for
sensitive systems, the identified gaps represent fundamental weaknesses
that significantly elevate the risk of a security incident. The
recommendations outlined in this report should be prioritized to
mitigate these immediate threats.</p>

<h1 id="security-control-review-questionnaire-analysis">Security Control
Review (Questionnaire Analysis)</h1>
<p>A security questionnaire was completed to evaluate the implementation
of key administrative and technical controls. The responses are
summarized below. Answers marked with a cross () indicate a potential
security gap that requires attention.</p>

</table>
<h4 id="analysis">Analysis:</h4>
<p>The questionnaire reveals critical deficiencies in access control and
employee security education. The absence of MFA on email and computer
logins is a major vulnerability. Furthermore, the lack of recurring
annual security training for all employees means that staff awareness of
current cyber threats is likely to be outdated, increasing the human
element of risk.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<h2 id="external-network-scan">External Network Scan</h2>
<p>The external network scan data provided in
<code>Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON</code> was found to be corrupted or
incomplete. As a result, an analysis of open ports, exposed services,
and potential vulnerabilities on the external IP address
(<code>211.204.106.102</code>) could not be performed.</p>
<h4 id="impact">Impact:</h4>
<p>Without this data, the organization’s external attack surface remains
unknown. There may be unpatched services, misconfigured applications, or
outdated software exposed to the internet, which could be exploited by
attackers. It is strongly recommended to perform a new, comprehensive
network scan as a matter of priority.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This risk assessment is based on the findings from the Security
Control Review. Due to corrupted input data, pre-existing risks and
technical vulnerabilities could not be included. The following table
summarizes the newly identified risks.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified
risks and strengthen the security posture of <strong>Vertex
Solutions</strong>. Recommendations are prioritized based on risk
severity.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication
(Critical)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Enforce MFA across all user accounts for
email access (e.g., Office 365, Google Workspace) and for logging into
company-managed computers (e.g., Windows Hello, Duo).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> This is the single most effective
control to prevent unauthorized account access (mitigates R-01 and
R-02). It provides a critical layer of defense even if user credentials
are stolen.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish an Annual Security Awareness Program
(High)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop and mandate an annual security
awareness training program for all employees. The training should cover
current threats, phishing identification, password hygiene, and company
security policies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> A well-informed workforce is a
crucial part of the security defense layer. Regular training ensures
that security remains a top-of-mind concern for all staff and reduces
the risk of human error (mitigates R-03).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct a New External Network Vulnerability Scan
(High)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Commission a new, authenticated and
unauthenticated vulnerability scan of the organization’s external
network perimeter, targeting the IP address
<code>211.204.106.102</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> The previous scan data was
unusable. A new scan is essential to identify and remediate technical
vulnerabilities on internet-facing systems before they can be exploited
by attackers.</p></li>
</ul></li>
