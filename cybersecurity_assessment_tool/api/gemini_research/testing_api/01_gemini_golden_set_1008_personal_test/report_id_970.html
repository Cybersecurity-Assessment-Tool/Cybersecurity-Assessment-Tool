<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment for <strong>Tidal Wave Sports</strong>. The assessment
combined a review of organizational security controls via a
questionnaire, an external network vulnerability scan, and an analysis
of pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The overall security posture presents a mixed landscape. The
organization demonstrates a strong commitment to identity and access
management, with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) consistently enforced
across email, computers, and sensitive data systems. From an external
network perspective, the target host at <code>[Target IP]</code> showed
no exposed services, indicating a robust firewall configuration.</p>
<p>However, significant procedural and governance gaps were identified.
The absence of a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy represents a
<strong>Critical</strong> risk, leaving the organization vulnerable to
insider threats and misuse of assets. Furthermore, the lack of mandatory
annual security awareness training for all employees constitutes a
<strong>High</strong> risk, as it increases susceptibility to evolving
social engineering tactics like phishing.</p>
<p>Immediate remediation should focus on establishing these foundational
governance controls to complement the existing technical strengths and
build a more resilient security program.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed to identify exposed services
and potential vulnerabilities on the perimeter.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> 2026-01-31</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Findings:</strong> The scan completed successfully and did
not identify any open TCP or UDP ports on the target system. All probes
were dropped or rejected, suggesting a well-configured firewall or
network access control list (ACL) is in place. This is a positive
security finding, as it significantly reduces the external attack
surface.</p>

<p>This section synthesizes findings from the security control review,

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified
risks and improve the overall security posture of <strong>Tidal Wave
Sports</strong>.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>1. Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Draft a comprehensive AUP that clearly
defines the rules for using company networks, computers, email, and
data. The policy should cover topics such as data privacy, password
security, prohibited activities, and consequences for
violation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> Critical</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Establishes a clear security baseline
for all employees, reduces the risk of misuse of assets, and provides a
legal framework for enforcement.</p></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt><strong>2. Establish a Mandatory Annual Security Training
Program:</strong></dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Implement a mandatory security awareness
training program for all employees, to be completed annually. The
training should be updated each year to cover the latest threats, such
as new phishing techniques and ransomware trends.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> High</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Creates a security-conscious culture,
reduces the likelihood of successful social engineering attacks, and
ensures the entire organization remains vigilant against evolving cyber
threats.</p></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p><strong>Tidal Wave Sports</strong> has established a strong technical
foundation with excellent MFA implementation and a secure network
perimeter. To mature its cybersecurity program, the organization must
now focus on the identified procedural and governance weaknesses. By
developing an Acceptable Use Policy and implementing annual security
awareness training, <strong>Tidal Wave Sports</strong> can significantly
reduce its risk exposure and build a more resilient, defense-in-depth
security posture.</p>
