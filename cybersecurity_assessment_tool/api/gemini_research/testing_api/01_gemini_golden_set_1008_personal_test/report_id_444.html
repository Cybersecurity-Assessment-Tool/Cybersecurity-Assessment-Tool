<h1 id="executive-overview">Executive Overview</h1>
<p>The primary objective of this assessment was to evaluate the current
security posture of Solid State by correlating organizational security
practices with technical findings.</p>
<p><strong>Important Note on Data Integrity:</strong> During the
analysis, it was discovered that the data from the technical network
scan (<code>Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON</code>) and the pre-existing risks
list (<code>Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON</code>) were corrupted and could
not be parsed. Consequently, this report’s findings are primarily
derived from the Security Control Review questionnaire.</p>
<p>The questionnaire revealed several critical and high-risk security
deficiencies. The most pressing concerns are the absence of Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for accessing email and other sensitive data
systems. This significantly increases the risk of account compromise,
business email compromise (BEC), and data breaches. Furthermore, the
lack of mandatory, annual security awareness training for all employees
leaves the organization vulnerable to evolving social engineering and
phishing attacks.</p>
<p>Immediate remediation of these identified gaps is strongly
recommended to reduce the organization’s attack surface and protect
critical assets.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network vulnerability scan was initiated against the organization’s
external IP address (<code>[Target IP]</code>). However, the raw output
data file was found to be corrupted and could not be processed.</p>
<p><strong>Status:</strong> No technical findings can be reported at
this time. A new scan is required to identify potential vulnerabilities
related to open ports, exposed services, and outdated software versions.
Without this data, the organization has a significant blind spot
regarding its external network-level security posture.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This risk assessment is based on the gaps identified in the Security
Control Review (Section 3). The unavailability of technical scan data
and pre-existing risk logs means this list is not exhaustive. The
following table prioritizes the most significant risks discovered during
this assessment.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the findings of this assessment, the following actions are
recommended to mitigate the identified risks and strengthen the overall
security posture of Solid State.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>[Critical] Implement MFA for Email Access:</strong>
Immediately enforce MFA for all users accessing the email system
(<code>SolidState.org</code>). This is the single most effective control
to prevent account takeovers and mitigate phishing-related
risks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>[Critical] Enforce MFA for Sensitive Data
Systems:</strong> Prioritize the deployment of MFA across all systems
identified as containing sensitive or critical data. This action
directly protects the organization’s most valuable assets from
unauthorized access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>[High] Establish a Mandatory Annual Security Awareness
Program:</strong> Develop and implement a security awareness training
program that is mandatory for all employees on an annual basis. The
training should cover current threats such as phishing, ransomware, and
social engineering.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>[Informational] Re-run External Network Scans:</strong>
The initial technical scan data was unreadable. A new, authenticated and
unauthenticated vulnerability scan of the external IP () and any other
public-facing assets should be conducted as soon as possible to identify
and remediate network-level vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>[Informational] Restore and Maintain a Risk
Register:</strong> The data for existing risks was unavailable. The
organization should ensure it maintains a formal risk register to track,
manage, and review identified vulnerabilities and security risks on an
ongoing basis.</p></li>
