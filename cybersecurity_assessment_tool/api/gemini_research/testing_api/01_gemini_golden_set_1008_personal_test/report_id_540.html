<h1 id="executive-overview">Executive Overview</h1>
<p>This report provides a cybersecurity posture assessment for
<strong>Blackwood Industries</strong>. The analysis is based on a
combination of self-reported organizational data, a technical network
scan, and a review of pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>A critical issue was identified during data collection: both the
technical network scan data (<code>Input_1</code>) and the current risks
data (<code>Input_3</code>) were corrupted and could not be parsed. This
creates a significant visibility gap into the organization’s external
attack surface and known vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>The analysis of the available organizational data
(<code>Input_2</code>) reveals several high-priority security gaps. The
most critical findings are the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
for accessing email and sensitive data systems. These gaps expose the
organization to a high risk of account compromise, business email
compromise (BEC), and data breaches. Additionally, the absence of a
formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy indicates a weakness in security
governance.</p>
<p>While the organization has implemented security awareness training
and requires MFA for computer logins, the identified control failures
require immediate attention. The recommendations in this report are
prioritized to address the most severe risks first. A comprehensive
re-assessment, including a successful network scan, is strongly
advised.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following information was provided by the client and used as a
baseline for this assessment.</p>

<h1 id="security-control-review-questionnaire">Security Control Review
(Questionnaire)</h1>
<p>A security questionnaire was completed to assess the implementation
of key administrative and technical controls. The responses are
summarized below. Items marked with a red cross () represent significant
control gaps that increase organizational risk.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>The questionnaire reveals critical weaknesses in access control
policies. The failure to enforce MFA on email and sensitive data systems
are high-severity findings. Email is a primary vector for phishing and
account takeover, while sensitive data systems are the ultimate target
for attackers seeking to exfiltrate valuable information. The lack of an
Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) represents a foundational governance gap,
leaving employees without clear guidelines on security
responsibilities.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was initiated against the target IP address
<code>[Target IP]</code>.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="scan-status-failed">Scan Status: FAILED</h2>
<p>The raw data file received from the network scanner
(<code>Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON</code>) was found to be corrupted and
could not be processed.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="implications">Implications</h2>
<p>Due to the corrupted data, there is currently no visibility into the
external network perimeter of <strong>Blackwood Industries</strong>. Key
information that could not be obtained includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Open TCP/UDP ports</p></li>
<li><p>Services, products, and versions running on open ports</p></li>
<li><p>Potential vulnerabilities associated with outdated or
misconfigured services</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This lack of visibility is a significant finding in itself. Without
this data, it is impossible to assess the technical attack surface
exposed to the internet. It is imperative that a new scan is conducted
successfully.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This risk assessment is based exclusively on the findings from the
Security Control Review due to the unavailability of technical scan data
and pre-existing risk information
(<code>Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON</code> was corrupted). The following
new risks have been identified.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actionable recommendations are prioritized based on the
severity of the identified risks.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>[Critical] Implement MFA on Sensitive Data
Systems:</strong> Immediately enforce MFA for all user accounts
(especially privileged accounts) that can access systems containing
sensitive or critical business data. This is the single most effective
control to prevent unauthorized access and data exfiltration.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>[High] Enforce MFA for Email Access:</strong> Deploy
mandatory MFA for all users accessing the corporate email system,
whether via webmail or client applications. This will drastically reduce
the likelihood of a successful phishing or account takeover
attack.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>[High] Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a formal AUP that clearly defines the rules and
responsibilities for all employees when using company technology and
data. Ensure all current and new employees read and formally acknowledge
the policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>[Informational] Conduct a New External Network
Scan:</strong> A new, complete network scan of the external IP range
must be performed to identify open ports and vulnerable services. The
results of this scan are essential for understanding and mitigating
technical risks on the network perimeter.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>[Informational] Restore Pre-existing Risk
Register:</strong> Investigate the cause of the data corruption for the
existing risk list (<code>Input_3</code>) and restore it from backups. A
historical view of risks is crucial for a mature risk management
program.</p></li>
