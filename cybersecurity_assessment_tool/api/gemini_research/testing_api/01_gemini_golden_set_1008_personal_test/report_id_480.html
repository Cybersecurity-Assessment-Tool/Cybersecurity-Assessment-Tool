<h1 id="executive-overview">Executive Overview</h1>
<p>This assessment reveals critical deficiencies in the foundational
cybersecurity controls at Golden Gate Gaming. The most significant
findings stem from the organizational security questionnaire, which
highlights a lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and
computer access, and a complete absence of a security awareness training
program for employees.</p>
<p>These gaps expose the organization to a high likelihood of successful
phishing attacks, business email compromise, and unauthorized access to
sensitive systems. While some positive controls are in place, such as an
acceptable use policy and MFA for sensitive data systems, the weaknesses
in frontline defenses undermine the overall security posture.</p>
<p>It is imperative to note that the external network scan data and the
list of pre-existing vulnerabilities were unavailable for this analysis
due to corrupted input files. Consequently, this report cannot comment
on the external attack surface or previously tracked risks. A new
technical scan and a review of existing risk documentation are strongly
recommended as immediate follow-up actions.</p>
<p>The recommendations in this report prioritize the implementation of
MFA and the establishment of a formal security awareness training
program to mitigate the most severe risks.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-gaps">Analysis of Gaps</h2>
<p>The questionnaire reveals four major security gaps:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>No MFA for Email:</strong> This is a critical
vulnerability. Email accounts are a primary target for attackers seeking
to perform reconnaissance, launch internal phishing campaigns, or commit
business email compromise (BEC) fraud.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No MFA for Computers:</strong> Lack of MFA on endpoints
allows an attacker with stolen credentials to gain direct access to a
user’s machine and potentially the internal network.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No New Employee Training:</strong> Failing to train new
employees on security best practices from day one leaves a critical
window of vulnerability.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Annual Training:</strong> The threat landscape evolves
continuously. Without annual refresher training, employees’ ability to
recognize and respond to new threats diminishes over time.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p><strong>Note: The data for the technical network scan
(<code>Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON</code>) was found to be corrupted and
could not be parsed.</strong></p>
<p>A network vulnerability scan against the organization’s external IP
address (<code>94.162.97.132</code>) was planned, but the results were
unusable. Therefore, this assessment cannot provide findings on the
following critical areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Open network ports and exposed services.</p></li>
<li><p>Potentially vulnerable software versions running on external
systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Insecure service configurations (e.g., weak SSL/TLS
ciphers).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is crucial to conduct a new, successful external vulnerability
scan to identify and remediate technical risks on the network
perimeter.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p><strong>Note: The data for pre-existing vulnerabilities
(<code>Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON</code>) was also

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actionable recommendations are provided to address the
identified risks and improve the overall security posture of Golden Gate
Gaming.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (High
Priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediately begin a project to enable
and enforce MFA across the organization.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scope:</strong> Prioritize all email accounts (e.g., via
Office 365 or Google Workspace policies). Following email, enforce MFA
for all computer logins (e.g., using Duo, Okta, or Windows Hello for
Business).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> This is the single most effective
control to mitigate the risk of GGG-001 and prevent unauthorized access
from compromised credentials.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish a Security Awareness Training Program (High
Priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Procure and implement a security
awareness training solution.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scope:</strong> The program must include mandatory
training for all new hires as part of their onboarding process.
Additionally, all existing employees must complete a training module
annually. Consider regular phishing simulations to reinforce
learning.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> This directly mitigates risk
GGG-002 by equipping employees to serve as a human firewall against
phishing and social engineering attempts.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct an External Network Vulnerability Scan (Medium
Priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Schedule and execute a new authenticated
and unauthenticated vulnerability scan against the external IP address
<code>94.162.97.132</code> and any other public-facing assets.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> The initial scan data was
unusable. A successful scan is essential to identify and patch technical
vulnerabilities on the network perimeter before they can be exploited by
attackers.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Review and Consolidate Risk Documentation (Medium
Priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Perform an internal audit to locate and
consolidate all existing risk registers and vulnerability tracking
documents.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> The provided list of current
risks was inaccessible. Maintaining a central and up-to-date risk
register is a fundamental component of a mature cybersecurity
program.</p></li>
