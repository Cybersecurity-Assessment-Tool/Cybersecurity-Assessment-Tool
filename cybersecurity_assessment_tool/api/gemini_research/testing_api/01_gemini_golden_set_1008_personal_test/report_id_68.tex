% --- 1. Executive Summary ---
\section{Executive Summary}
This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment for \textbf{Stone Arch Masonry}. The analysis is based on a synthesis of network scan data, a review of organizational security controls, and an evaluation of pre-existing risk information.

The assessment identified several critical and high-risk vulnerabilities that require immediate attention. Key findings include the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for primary access vectors such as email and computer logins, a lack of mandatory annual security awareness training for all staff, and the presence of an unencrypted web service (HTTP) on the network. These deficiencies create significant exposure to account compromise, data breaches, and social engineering attacks.

This document details these findings and provides actionable recommendations to mitigate the identified risks and strengthen the organization's overall security posture.

\section{Organizational Information}
The following information was provided for the assessment.

\begin{tabular}{@{}ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Attribute} & \textbf{Value} \\
\midrule
Organization Name & \textbf{Stone Arch Masonry} \\
Email Domain & \texttt{StoneArchMasonry.net} \\
Website Domain & \url{www.StoneArchMasonry.net} \\
External IP Address & \texttt{30.42.82.229} \\

\end{tabular}

% --- 3. Security Control Review ---
\section{Security Control Review}
An internal security questionnaire was reviewed to assess the current state of administrative and technical controls. The responses indicate significant gaps in access control and employee security training. A "No" response (\ding{55}) highlights a control deficiency that should be addressed.

% --- 4. Technical Scan Results ---
\section{Technical Scan Results}
A network scan was performed to identify active services on the specified target system. The scan revealed an open port running an unencrypted service, which poses a risk of data interception.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Target IP Address:} \texttt{172.16.0.1}
    \item \textbf{Scan Date:} \today
\end{itemize}

\begin{table}[h!]

\begin{tabular}{@{}llll@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Port} & \textbf{State} & \textbf{Service/Notes} \\
\midrule
80/tcp & Open & \textbf{HTTP (Unencrypted Web Traffic).} Lacks encryption (TLS/SSL). \\
 & & All data, including potential login credentials, is sent in cleartext. \\

\section{Correlated Risk Assessment}
The following table synthesizes findings from the security control review and the technical scan to present a prioritized list of risks.

\toprule
\textbf{ID} & \textbf{Risk Description} & \textbf{Severity} & \textbf{Affected Elements} \\
\midrule
\textbf{RISK-01} & \textbf{Lack of MFA on Critical Systems.} No MFA on email or computer logins significantly increases the risk of account takeover via stolen credentials. & \textbf{Critical} & All employee accounts, workstations, email system. \\
\addlinespace
\textbf{RISK-02} & \textbf{Unencrypted Web Communications.} The web server at \texttt{172.16.0.1} uses HTTP, exposing all transmitted data to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. & \textbf{High} & Web server, internal users, data in transit. \\
\addlinespace
\textbf{RISK-03} & \textbf{Insufficient Security Training.} Lack of annual security awareness training for all employees leads to a decline in vigilance against phishing and other social engineering tactics. & \textbf{High} & All employees, organizational data. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}

% --- 6. Recommendations ---
\section{Recommendations}
The following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified risks. They are prioritized based on severity and potential impact.

\subsection{Immediate Priority (Critical Risks)}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Immediately deploy and enforce MFA for all user access to the email system (\texttt{StoneArchMasonry.net}).
        \item Implement MFA for all workstation and laptop logins across the organization. This should apply to both local and remote access.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Secure Web Communications:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Obtain and install a TLS/SSL certificate on the web server at \texttt{172.16.0.1}.
        \item Reconfigure the server to use HTTPS (port 443) for all traffic.
        \item Implement a permanent redirect (HTTP 301) to automatically forward all HTTP requests to HTTPS, ensuring all connections are encrypted.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{High Priority}
\begin{enumerate}
    \setcounter{enumi}{2} % Continue numbering
    \item \textbf{Establish Annual Security Awareness Training:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Develop or procure a mandatory security awareness training program for all employees.
        \item Conduct this training annually to ensure that knowledge of current threats (e.g., phishing, ransomware, social engineering) remains up-to-date.
        \item Track completion to ensure 100\% participation.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

% --- 7. Conclusion ---
\section{Conclusion}
The assessment reveals critical gaps in the security posture of \textbf{Stone Arch Masonry}. While some foundational controls are in place, the absence of MFA on key systems and the use of unencrypted protocols present an unacceptable level of risk.

By implementing the prioritized recommendations outlined in this report, the organization can significantly reduce its attack surface, enhance its resilience against common cyber threats, and build a stronger security foundation.
