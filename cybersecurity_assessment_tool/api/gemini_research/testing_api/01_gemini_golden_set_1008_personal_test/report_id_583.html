<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the cybersecurity
posture for Green Sprout Organic, based on a combination of network
scanning, organizational data review, and an assessment of existing
risks. The analysis reveals a mixed security landscape. While
foundational controls like an acceptable use policy are in place,
several critical and high-risk gaps were identified that require
immediate attention.</p>
<p>Key findings include a critical lack of Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) on sensitive data systems and for computer logins. Furthermore,
new employees do not receive security awareness training, creating a
significant vulnerability from their first day. Technical analysis
identified an externally accessible Secure Shell (SSH) service, which,
if not properly configured, presents a direct vector for attack.</p>
<p>This report outlines these risks in detail and provides a prioritized
list of actionable recommendations. Addressing these findings,
particularly the implementation of MFA and bolstering security training,
is crucial to significantly improve the organization’s resilience
against common cyber threats.</p>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A review of the organization’s security controls was conducted via a

weakness in the current security policies and procedures. Gaps
identified here often represent significant organizational risk.</p>

Gaps</h2>
<p>The responses marked with a  highlight critical deficiencies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>No MFA for Computers &amp; Sensitive Systems:</strong>
This is the most critical finding. The absence of MFA on these systems
means that a single compromised password could lead to unauthorized
network access and a potential data breach.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Security Training for New Employees:</strong> New
hires are a primary target for social engineering and phishing attacks.
Failing to provide immediate security training leaves the organization
vulnerable, as these employees are unaware of internal policies and
common threats.</p></li>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of
Technical Findings</h2>
<p>The primary finding is the exposed SSH service. While necessary for
remote administration, an internet-facing SSH port is a high-value
target for attackers. Without information on its configuration (e.g.,
password policy, key-based authentication), it must be treated as a
significant risk. This finding, correlated with the lack of MFA,
elevates the risk of unauthorized system access.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified
risks and strengthen the overall security posture of Green Sprout
Organic. Recommendations are prioritized based on risk severity.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>[Critical] Implement MFA on Sensitive Systems
(RISK-001):</strong> Immediately enforce mandatory MFA for all access to
systems containing sensitive or critical data. Prioritize strong
authentication methods such as authenticator apps (TOTP) or hardware
security keys over less secure methods like SMS.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>[High] Establish New Employee Security Training
(RISK-002):</strong> Integrate a mandatory security awareness training
module into the new employee onboarding process. This training should be
completed before a new hire is granted access to company systems and
should cover phishing, password hygiene, and acceptable use
policies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>[High] Harden Exposed SSH Service (RISK-003):</strong>
Review the business need for the publicly accessible SSH port on .</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If not required, disable it.</p></li>
<li><p>If required, implement a firewall rule to restrict access to only
trusted IP addresses.</p></li>
<li><p>Disable password-based authentication and enforce the use of
strong SSH keys.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement an intrusion detection/prevention tool like
<code>fail2ban</code> to block brute-force attempts.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>[Medium] Deploy MFA for Workstation Logins
(RISK-004):</strong> Begin a phased rollout of MFA for all employee
computer logins. This adds a critical layer of security that protects
against credential theft and hinders an attacker’s ability to move
laterally within the network.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>[Informational] Conduct Authenticated Vulnerability
Scanning:</strong> The initial network scan was unauthenticated and
provided limited detail. A comprehensive, authenticated vulnerability
scan should be conducted across all external and internal assets to
identify specific software versions and missing security
patches.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Green Sprout Organic has established some important security
foundations, but this assessment has identified critical gaps that
expose the organization to significant risk. The lack of robust identity
and access management controls, particularly MFA, combined with
deficiencies in employee security training, creates a high-risk
environment.</p>
<p>By implementing the prioritized recommendations in this report, Green
Sprout Organic can substantially reduce its attack surface, mitigate the
most severe risks, and build a more resilient and secure operational
environment.</p>
