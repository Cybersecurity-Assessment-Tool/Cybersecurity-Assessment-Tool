<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity assessment for
<strong>Foresight Strategies</strong>, based on network scan data,
organizational security controls, and known risks. The analysis reveals
a high-risk security posture primarily driven by the direct network
exposure of a critical database system.</p>
<p>Key findings indicate that while some foundational security controls
like Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email are in place, critical
gaps exist. A MySQL database was found to be publicly accessible, a
finding which is significantly compounded by the lack of MFA for
sensitive data systems. Furthermore, procedural gaps, such as the
absence of security awareness training for new employees, increase the
organization’s susceptibility to credential compromise and social
engineering attacks.</p>
<p>Immediate remediation is required to restrict access to the exposed
database. Strategic initiatives must be undertaken to enforce stronger
access controls and enhance employee security awareness to mitigate the
substantial risk of a data breach.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>

<p>A review of the organization’s self-reported security controls was
conducted. The following table summarizes the responses to the security
questionnaire. Items marked with represent significant gaps in the

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-control-gaps">Analysis of Control
Gaps</h2>
<p>Two critical control gaps were identified:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>No MFA for Sensitive Systems:</strong> The absence of MFA
on sensitive data systems is a critical vulnerability. In the event of a
credential compromise, an attacker would have direct access to the
organization’s most valuable data. This directly elevates the risk
associated with any exposed service.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Security Training for New Hires:</strong> New
employees are a common target for phishing and social engineering
attacks. The lack of initial security training leaves the organization
vulnerable, as a new hire could inadvertently compromise credentials or
introduce malware.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on the specified target to identify open
ports and exposed services.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of
Technical Findings</h2>
<p>The scan confirms that a MySQL database server is directly exposed to
the network on port <code>3306</code>. Exposing a database directly is a
highly dangerous practice, as it allows attackers to perform brute-force
attacks, exploit potential vulnerabilities in the database software, or
leverage stolen credentials to access data. The version detected, MySQL
5.7.33, is also several years old and may lack patches for recently
discovered vulnerabilities. This finding validates the pre-existing risk
documented in <code>Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON</code>.</p>
<h1 id="consolidated-risk-assessment">Consolidated Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes the findings from the security control
review, technical scan, and pre-existing risk data to provide a holistic
view of the primary risks facing the organization.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified
risks. They are prioritized based on severity and the potential for
impact.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="immediate-actions-to-be-completed-within-24-48-hours">Immediate
Actions (To be completed within 24-48 hours)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Restrict Database Access:</strong> Immediately implement
firewall rules to block all public access to port <code>3306</code> on
the server at <code>172.16.50.20</code>. Access should only be permitted
from specific, trusted internal IP addresses.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="high-priority-actions-to-be-completed-within-30-days">High-Priority
Actions (To be completed within 30 days)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Enforce MFA on Sensitive Systems:</strong> Procure and
deploy an MFA solution for all sensitive data systems, with the highest
priority on databases and administrative interfaces. This is the single
most effective control to mitigate the risk of credential
compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement New Hire Security Training:</strong> Develop a
mandatory security awareness training module that is a required part of
the onboarding process for all new employees and contractors. This
training should cover phishing, password hygiene, and acceptable use
policies.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="strategic-long-term-actions-to-be-completed-within-6-12-months">Strategic
Long-Term Actions (To be completed within 6-12 months)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Deploy Secure Remote Access:</strong> For administrative
access to critical systems like databases, implement a Virtual Private
Network (VPN) or Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) solution. This
eliminates the need for any direct public exposure of sensitive
services.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish a Vulnerability Management Program:</strong>
Implement a program for regular, automated vulnerability scanning of all
internal and external assets. This will help proactively identify and
remediate exposures before they can be exploited.</p></li>
