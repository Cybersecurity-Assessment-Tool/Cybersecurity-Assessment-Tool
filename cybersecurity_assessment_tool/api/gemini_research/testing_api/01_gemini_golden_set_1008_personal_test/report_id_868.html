<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the cybersecurity
posture for Summit Peak Partners, based on a combination of technical
network scanning, a review of organizational security controls, and an
assessment of pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The technical scan of the target host <code>192.168.1.100</code>
revealed a strong security configuration, with no open ports detected.
This indicates effective network-level filtering or a lack of exposed
services on the scanned asset, which is a positive finding.</p>
<p>However, the organizational security control review identified
several <strong>critical gaps</strong> in fundamental security
practices. The absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all
key systems (email, computer logins, and sensitive data access)
represents a severe risk. A single compromised password could lead to a
significant data breach. Furthermore, the lack of an employee acceptable
use policy and security training for new hires weakens the
organization’s "human firewall," making it more susceptible to social
engineering and phishing attacks.</p>
<p>Immediate and decisive action is required to address these procedural
and identity management deficiencies to mitigate the high probability of
a security incident.</p>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A review of administrative and procedural security controls was
conducted via a questionnaire. The responses indicate significant areas
for improvement, particularly concerning identity and access management.
A "No" answer () highlights a deviation from security best practices and
introduces risk.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed to identify potentially vulnerable
services exposed on the target system.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>192.168.1.100</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Tool:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Finding:</strong> The scan concluded that the host was
online, but reported that all 1000 scanned ports were in a
<code>closed</code> state. No open ports or active services were
detected.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Analysis:</strong> This is a positive security finding.
It suggests the host is well-protected by a firewall that properly
denies external connections, or that the host intentionally exposes no
network services. This significantly reduces the external attack surface
of this specific asset.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the synthesis of the security control review and technical
scan, the following risks have been identified. The primary threats are
currently not from externally exposed technical vulnerabilities but from
internal policy and identity management weaknesses. No pre-existing
vulnerabilities were reported.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified
risks and improve the overall cybersecurity posture of Summit Peak
Partners. Recommendations are prioritized based on severity.</p>
<h2 id="immediate-priority-critical">Immediate Priority (Critical)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong>
This is the single most effective control to mitigate the risk of
account compromise.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Phase 1 (Email):</strong> Immediately enforce MFA on the
<code>SummitPeakPartners.com</code> email system for all users.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Phase 2 (Remote Access &amp; Sensitive Data):</strong>
Enforce MFA for any remote access solutions (e.g., VPN) and all systems
housing sensitive client or financial data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Phase 3 (Workstations):</strong> Plan and execute a
rollout of MFA for all employee computer logins.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="high-priority">High Priority</h2>
<ol start="2">
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a formal AUP that all employees must read and
sign. This policy should clearly define the rules for using company
networks, devices, and data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Institute Onboarding Security Training:</strong>
Integrate a mandatory security awareness training module into the new
employee onboarding process. This should cover key topics such as
phishing, password security, and the new AUP.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="medium-priority">Medium Priority</h2>
<ol start="4">
<li><p><strong>Enhance Annual Security Training:</strong> Continue the
existing annual security training program. Consider incorporating
phishing simulation exercises to measure and improve employee resilience
against real-world attacks.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Summit Peak Partners currently exhibits a mixed security posture.
While the scanned network asset demonstrates good technical hardening,
the organization’s foundational security controls are critically
underdeveloped. The absence of MFA, security policies, and new-hire
training creates an environment where a simple attack, such as a
successful phish, could have severe consequences.</p>
<p>By implementing the prioritized recommendations in this report,
Summit Peak Partners can significantly reduce its risk exposure and
build a more resilient and mature cybersecurity program.</p>
