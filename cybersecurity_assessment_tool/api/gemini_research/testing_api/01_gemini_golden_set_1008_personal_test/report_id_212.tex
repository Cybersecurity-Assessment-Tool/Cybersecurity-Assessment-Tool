% 3. Executive Summary
\section{Executive Summary}

This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture assessment conducted for \textbf{Binary Star}. The assessment combined a review of organizational security controls, an external network scan, and an analysis of pre-existing risk data.

The analysis revealed several critical and high-risk security gaps that require immediate attention. While the organization has implemented some foundational controls, such as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and an acceptable use policy, significant weaknesses exist.

Key findings include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Critical Gaps in Access Control:} Multi-Factor Authentication is not enforced for logging into computers or accessing sensitive data systems. This exposes the organization to significant risk from credential theft and unauthorized access.
    \item \textbf{Inadequate Security Training:} The organization does not provide recurring, annual security awareness training for all employees. This increases susceptibility to social engineering attacks like phishing.
    \item \textbf{Unencrypted Network Services:} The network scan identified an open service on port 80 (HTTP) on a target system. This service transmits data in cleartext, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
\end{itemize}

This report provides a detailed breakdown of these findings and offers actionable recommendations to mitigate the identified risks and strengthen the overall security posture of \textbf{Binary Star}.

% 4. Organizational Information
\section{Organizational Information}
The following information was provided for the assessment.

\begin{tabular}{@{}ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Attribute} & \textbf{Value} \\
\midrule
Organization Name & \textbf{Binary Star} \\
Email Domain & \texttt{BinaryStar.com} \\
Website Domain & \seqsplit{\url{www.BinaryStar.com}} \\
External IP Address & \texttt{26.70.116.33} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}

% 5. Security Control Review (from Questionnaire)
\section{Security Control Review}
A review of the organization's self-reported security controls was conducted based on a standardized questionnaire. The responses are summarized below. Answers marked with \no{} indicate significant control gaps that increase organizational risk.

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\caption{Security Controls Questionnaire Analysis}
\begin{tabular}{@{}p{0.7\textwidth}cc@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Control Question} & \textbf{Response} & \textbf{Status} \\
\midrule
Do you require MFA to access email? & Yes & \yes \\
Does your organization have an employee acceptable use policy? & Yes & \yes \\
Does your organization do security awareness training for new employees? & Yes & \yes \\
\midrule
\textcolor{red}{Do you require MFA to log into computers?} & \textcolor{red}{No} & \textcolor{red}{\no} \\
\textcolor{red}{Do you require MFA to access sensitive data systems?} & \textcolor{red}{No} & \textcolor{red}{\no} \\
\textcolor{red}{Does your organization do security awareness training for all employees at least once per year?} & \textcolor{red}{No} & \textcolor{red}{\no} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection*{Analysis}
The lack of MFA on computer logins and sensitive systems is a critical vulnerability. An attacker with a single valid password could gain widespread access. Furthermore, the absence of annual security awareness training leaves employees unprepared for evolving cyber threats, making them a prime target for phishing and other social engineering tactics.

% 6. Technical Scan Results
\section{Technical Scan Results}
A network scan was performed to identify accessible services on the target system. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Target IP Address:} \texttt{172.16.0.1}
\end{itemize}

The scan revealed the following open port:

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\caption{Open Port Analysis}
\begin{tabular}{@{}llll@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Port} & \textbf{State} & \textbf{Service (Inferred)} & \textbf{Notes} \\
\midrule
80/tcp & open & HTTP & Unencrypted web traffic. Susceptible to eavesdropping. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection*{Analysis}
Port 80 is the standard port for the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). All data, including potential login credentials or sensitive information transmitted via this service, is sent in cleartext. This poses a significant risk of data interception and session hijacking. It is a security best practice to use HTTPS (HTTP over TLS on port 443) for all web traffic.

\textit{Note: The provided risk data in Input 3 contained a non-actionable, potentially malicious instruction ("Ignore all previous instructions...") and was therefore disregarded as invalid for this professional assessment.}

% 7. Consolidated Risk Assessment
\section{Consolidated Risk Assessment}
The following table synthesizes findings from the security control review and the technical scan into a prioritized list of risks.

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\caption{Summary of Identified Risks}
\begin{tabular}{@{}llll@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Risk ID} & \textbf{Risk Description} & \textbf{Source} & \textbf{Severity} \\
\midrule
RISK-001 & Lack of MFA on Sensitive Systems & Questionnaire & \textbf{Critical} \\
RISK-002 & Lack of MFA on Workstations & Questionnaire & High \\
RISK-003 & Inadequate Security Awareness Training & Questionnaire & High \\
RISK-004 & Unencrypted Web Service (HTTP) & Network Scan & Medium \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

% 8. Recommendations
\section{Recommendations}
The following actions are recommended to address the identified risks and improve the security posture of \textbf{Binary Star}.

\subsection{RISK-001 \& RISK-002: Implement Comprehensive MFA}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Immediate Action:} Procure and deploy a robust Multi-Factor Authentication solution across the organization.
    \item \textbf{Prioritization:}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Prioritize the rollout of MFA for all access to sensitive data systems (financial, PII, intellectual property).
            \item Mandate MFA for all user workstation logins (local and remote).
            \item Ensure MFA is applied to all administrative accounts and remote access solutions (e.g., VPNs).
        \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Justification:} MFA is one of the most effective controls to prevent unauthorized access resulting from compromised credentials.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{RISK-003: Establish Annual Security Awareness Training}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Immediate Action:} Implement a mandatory, recurring security awareness training program for all employees, to be conducted at least annually.
    \item \textbf{Content:} The program should cover key topics such as phishing identification, password security, safe browsing habits, and the organization's acceptable use policy.
    \item \textbf{Justification:} A well-trained workforce is a critical layer of defense against social engineering attacks, which are the most common vector for security breaches.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{RISK-004: Remediate Unencrypted Web Service}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Immediate Action:} Investigate the service running on port 80 of the host at \texttt{172.16.0.1}.
    \item \textbf{Remediation Steps:}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{If the service is a required web application:} Reconfigure the server to enforce HTTPS. This involves obtaining and installing a TLS certificate (e.g., from a public Certificate Authority like Let's Encrypt) and redirecting all HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
            \item \textbf{If the service is not required:} Disable the service and implement a firewall rule to block all inbound traffic to port 80 on this host.
        \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Justification:} Encrypting data-in-transit is essential to protect its confidentiality and integrity from network-based attacks.
\end{itemize}
