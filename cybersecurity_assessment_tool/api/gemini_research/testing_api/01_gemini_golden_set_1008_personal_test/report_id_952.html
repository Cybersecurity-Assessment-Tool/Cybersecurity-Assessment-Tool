<h1 id="executive-overview">Executive Overview</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment conducted for Bluebird Bio. The assessment combines an
analysis of organizational security controls, an external network
vulnerability scan, and a review of existing risks.</p>
<p>The overall security posture presents a mixed landscape. On a
positive note, the external network scan of the target host
<code>192.168.1.100</code> revealed no open ports, suggesting a strong
perimeter defense or that no services are exposed on that specific host.
The organization has also successfully implemented Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for email and computer access, which are
foundational security controls.</p>
<p>However, several critical gaps were identified through the security
controls questionnaire. The absence of MFA for sensitive data systems
represents a significant risk, potentially exposing the organization’s
most valuable assets to unauthorized access. Furthermore, the complete
lack of a security awareness training program for both new and existing
employees creates a high susceptibility to social engineering attacks,
such as phishing. These policy and procedural gaps are the most pressing
concerns identified during this assessment and should be prioritized for
remediation.</p>

<p>A review of key organizational security controls was conducted based
on a supplied questionnaire. The results indicate areas of both strength
and weakness. Gaps identified with a ’No’ response represent significant
risks that require immediate attention.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed to identify exposed services and
potential vulnerabilities on the perimeter.</p>
<h2 id="nmap-scan-on-192.168.1.100">Nmap Scan on
<code>192.168.1.100</code></h2>
<p>The scan results for the target host are summarized below.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP:</strong> <code>192.168.1.100</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> Up</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Finding:</strong> The scan confirmed that the host is
online and responsive. However, all scanned ports were found to be in a
’closed’ state. This indicates that there are no open, listening
services (e.g., web, email, remote access) exposed to the scanner on
this host. This is a positive security finding, suggesting effective
firewall rules or a lack of externally facing services on this
particular system.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes findings from the security control review
and technical scans. Since no pre-existing vulnerabilities were reported
and the network scan found no open ports, the primary risks identified
are procedural and policy-based.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the risks identified in the previous section, the following
prioritized recommendations are provided to improve the cybersecurity
posture of Bluebird Bio.</p>
<h2 id="remediation-for-risk-001-critical">Remediation for RISK-001
(Critical)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Implement and enforce Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) across all systems and applications that store,
process, or transmit sensitive data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Details:</strong> Prioritize systems with access to
financial records, customer Personally Identifiable Information (PII),
and proprietary intellectual property. This single control is one of the
most effective measures to prevent unauthorized access.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="remediation-for-risk-002-high">Remediation for RISK-002
(High)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop and implement a mandatory
security awareness training program for all personnel.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Details:</strong> This program should be a mandatory part
of the onboarding process for all new employees. It must cover essential
topics such as phishing identification, password hygiene, acceptable use
of company assets, and incident reporting procedures.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Establish a recurring, annual security
awareness training and phishing simulation campaign for all
employees.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Details:</strong> Continuous education is vital. An
annual refresher course, supplemented with periodic phishing tests, will
help maintain a high level of security consciousness throughout the
organization and measure the effectiveness of the training.</p></li>
