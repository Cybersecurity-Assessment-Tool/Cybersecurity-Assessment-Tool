\section{Executive Summary}

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the cybersecurity posture for \textbf{Binary Star}, based on network scans, a security controls questionnaire, and a review of pre-existing risks. The assessment was conducted on \today.

The analysis reveals a critically weak security posture characterized by significant and fundamental gaps in both technical and administrative controls. Key findings include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Critical Control Gaps:} The organization lacks Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical services, including email, computer logins, and access to sensitive data. Furthermore, there is a complete absence of an employee acceptable use policy and any form of security awareness training. These deficiencies dramatically increase the risk of a successful phishing attack or insider threat leading to a full-scale breach.
    
    \item \textbf{Critical Technical Vulnerabilities:} An external network scan identified a publicly accessible MySQL database server. This server is running MySQL version 5.7.33, which reached its official End-of-Life (EOL) in October 2023. As an EOL product, it no longer receives security patches, leaving it exposed to numerous known and future exploits.
    
    \item \textbf{High-Risk Exposure:} The combination of a publicly exposed, unpatched database and the lack of basic access controls like MFA creates a high-impact, high-likelihood risk scenario. An attacker could potentially exploit the database to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.
\end{itemize}

Immediate and decisive action is required to remediate these findings. Recommendations are prioritized to address the most critical risks first, focusing on isolating exposed systems, patching vulnerable software, and implementing foundational security controls.

The following information was provided for the assessment.

\begin{tabular}{@{}ll}

    \textbf{Attribute} & \textbf{Value} \\
    \midrule
    Organization Name & \textbf{Binary Star} \\
    Email Domain & \texttt{BinaryStar.com} \\

% --- Section 3: Security Control Review ---
\section{Security Control Review}

A security questionnaire was completed to assess the maturity of administrative and procedural controls. The results, detailed in Table \ref{tab:controls}, indicate a complete absence of the fundamental security practices queried. Each "No" response represents a significant gap that weakens the organization's defense against common cyber threats.

    Do you require MFA to access sensitive data systems? & \textcolor{red}{\no} \\
    Does your organization have an employee acceptable use policy? & \textcolor{red}{\no} \\

% --- Section 4: Technical Scan Results ---
\section{Technical Scan Results}

An Nmap scan was performed against the target system to identify open ports and running services.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Target IP Address:} \texttt{172.16.50.20}
    \item \textbf{Scan Date:} \today
\end{itemize}

The scan identified one open port, as detailed in Table \ref{tab:scan}.

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\caption{Open Port Analysis}
\label{tab:scan}
\begin{tabular}{@{}llll@{}}
    \toprule
    \textbf{Port} & \textbf{State} & \textbf{Service} & \textbf{Product \& Version} \\
    \midrule
    3306/tcp & Open & mysql & MySQL 5.7.33 \\
    \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Analysis of Findings}
The open MySQL port (3306) indicates that the database server is directly accessible from the network where the scan was initiated. This is a dangerous configuration, as it exposes the database to brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, and direct exploitation of vulnerabilities.

More critically, the detected version, \textbf{MySQL 5.7.33}, is an End-of-Life (EOL) product. It no longer receives security updates from the vendor, meaning any vulnerabilities discovered after October 2023 will remain unpatched. This exposes the organization to severe and unmitigable risks.

\section{Consolidated Risk Assessment}

By correlating the questionnaire results, technical scan data, and pre-existing risk information, we have compiled a summary of the top risks facing the organization.

\begin{table}[h!]

\caption{Summary of Key Risks}
\label{tab:risks}
\begin{tabular}{@{}p{0.25\linewidth}p{0.15\linewidth}p{0.5\linewidth}@{}}
    \toprule
    \textbf{Risk Name} & \textbf{Severity} & \textbf{Overview} \\
    \midrule
    \textbf{Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)} & \textbf{Critical} & The absence of MFA on email, endpoints, and sensitive systems means a single compromised password could lead to a complete account takeover and system breach. \\
    \addlinespace
    \textbf{Outdated Database Software} & \textbf{Critical} & The use of an End-of-Life MySQL version (5.7.33) means the system is not receiving security patches and is likely vulnerable to numerous known exploits. \\
    \addlinespace
    \textbf{Public Database Exposure} & \textbf{High (7.5)} & The MySQL port (3306) is open to the network, exposing it to reconnaissance, brute-force attacks, and direct exploitation attempts. This was a pre-existing identified risk, now confirmed by technical scans. \\
    \addlinespace
    \textbf{Lack of Security Policies \& Training} & \textbf{High} & Without an Acceptable Use Policy or security training, employees are more likely to engage in risky behavior (e.g., fall for phishing scams, use weak passwords), creating an insecure human firewall. \\
    \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

% --- Section 6: Recommendations ---
\section{Recommendations}

The following actionable recommendations are prioritized to address the identified risks. Immediate action should be taken on all "Critical" items.

\subsection{Immediate Priority (Critical)}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Isolate the Database Server:} Immediately apply firewall rules to restrict all access to port 3306 on server \texttt{172.16.50.20}. Access should only be permitted from specific, trusted application server IP addresses. Public access must be disabled.
    
    \item \textbf{Plan Database Upgrade:} Initiate a project to upgrade the MySQL 5.7 database to a currently supported version (e.g., MySQL 8.0 or later). This is the only way to mitigate the risks associated with unpatched, End-of-Life software.
    
    \item \textbf{Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):} Procure and deploy an MFA solution. Prioritize enabling it for:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item All external access (e.g., VPN, remote desktop).
        \item All email accounts (e.g., Microsoft 365, Google Workspace).
        \item All administrative and privileged accounts.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{High Priority}
\begin{enumerate}
    \setcounter{enumi}{3} % Continue numbering
    \item \textbf{Develop and Enforce an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):} Create a formal AUP that clearly defines the rules for using company assets, data handling, password requirements, and the consequences of non-compliance. All employees must read and acknowledge this policy.
    
    \item \textbf{Implement Security Awareness Training:} Enroll all employees in a mandatory security awareness training program. The program should be conducted for all new hires and repeated annually for all staff. Key topics must include phishing identification, password security, and social engineering.
\end{enumerate}
