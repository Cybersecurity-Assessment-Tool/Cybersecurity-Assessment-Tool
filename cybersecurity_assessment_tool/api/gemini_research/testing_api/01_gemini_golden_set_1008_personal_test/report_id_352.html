<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for <strong>Orchid Isle</strong>, conducted on 2026-01-31. The analysis
synthesizes data from an external network scan, a review of
organizational security controls, and a list of pre-existing risks.</p>
<h4 id="key-findings">Key Findings:</h4>
<p>The assessment reveals a mixed security posture. On a positive note,
the external network scan of the target host
(<code>192.168.1.100</code>) showed no exposed services, indicating a
well-hardened network perimeter for that specific asset. However,
significant and critical gaps were identified in the organization’s
internal security policies and controls.</p>
<h4 id="primary-risks">Primary Risks:</h4>
<p>The most critical risks stem from procedural and policy-based
deficiencies rather than technical vulnerabilities. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive
Data Systems:</strong> This is a critical vulnerability that
significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access and data
breaches.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong>
Without a formal AUP, there is no clear guidance for employees on the
secure use of company assets, leading to inconsistent security
practices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Security Awareness Training Program:</strong> The
complete lack of security training for both new and existing employees
leaves the organization highly susceptible to social engineering
attacks, such as phishing.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="recommendations">Recommendations:</h4>
<p>Immediate action is required to address these policy gaps. We
recommend prioritizing the implementation of MFA across all sensitive
systems, followed by the development of a comprehensive AUP and the
establishment of a mandatory, ongoing security awareness training
program.</p>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>The following table summarizes the organization’s responses to a
security controls questionnaire. "No" answers indicate significant gaps
in the security framework and are flagged as risks.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network vulnerability scan was performed to identify
exposed services and potential entry points.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Target:</strong> <code>192.168.1.100</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> 2026-01-31</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="summary-of-findings">Summary of Findings</h2>
<p>The scan results were positive. The target host was responsive
(status: up), but no open TCP or UDP ports were discovered. All 65,535
ports were reported as being in a "closed" state.</p>
<h4 id="analysis">Analysis:</h4>
<p>A host with no open ports presents a minimal attack surface from the
network perspective. This indicates effective firewall configuration and
network segmentation for this specific asset, which is a strong security
practice. No vulnerabilities were identified based on this scan.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment-summary">Risk Assessment Summary</h1>
<p>This section consolidates risks identified from the security control
review, technical scans, and pre-existing vulnerability data. As no
pre-existing or technical risks were found, the summary focuses on the
organizational gaps identified.</p>
<div class="tabular">
<p><span>L<span>7cm</span> l l</span> <strong>Risk Description</strong>
&amp; <strong>Severity</strong> &amp; <strong>Source</strong><br />
<strong>No MFA on Sensitive Systems:</strong> Lack of MFA on systems
storing or processing sensitive data exposes the organization to
high-impact breaches from compromised credentials. &amp;
<strong>Critical</strong> &amp; Questionnaire<br />
<strong>No Acceptable Use Policy:</strong> The absence of a formal
policy creates ambiguity regarding secure practices, increasing the
likelihood of insider threat (unintentional) and policy violations.
&amp; <strong>High</strong> &amp; Questionnaire<br />
<strong>No Security Awareness Training:</strong> Employees are not
trained to recognize or respond to cyber threats like phishing, making
them the primary vector for potential intrusions. &amp;

<h1 id="recommendations-1">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actionable recommendations are provided to mitigate the
identified risks and improve the overall security posture of
<strong>Orchid Isle</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="priority-1-remediate-critical-risks">Priority 1: Remediate
Critical Risks</h2>
<dl>
<dt>R-01: Implement MFA for Sensitive Systems</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediately deploy and enforce MFA for all
user accounts (including administrative and service accounts) that have
access to systems containing sensitive, confidential, or critical data.
<strong>Impact:</strong> Drastically reduces the risk of unauthorized
access via stolen or weak credentials.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="priority-2-remediate-high-risks">Priority 2: Remediate High
Risks</h2>
<dl>
<dt>R-02: Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Create a formal AUP document that clearly
defines the rules and expectations for employees when using
company-owned IT assets, networks, and data. This policy should be
reviewed by legal counsel, communicated to all staff, and formally
acknowledged via signature. <strong>Impact:</strong> Establishes a
baseline for secure user behavior and provides a framework for
enforcement.</p>
</dd>
<dt>R-03: Establish a Security Awareness Training Program</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Procure and implement a security awareness
training solution. The program must include mandatory initial training
for all new hires and annual refresher training for all employees.
Topics should cover phishing, password security, data handling, and
threat reporting. <strong>Impact:</strong> Reduces the organization’s
susceptibility to social engineering and human error, strengthening the
"human firewall."</p>
