<p><strong>Cybersecurity Posture Report</strong></p>
<p><strong>Prepared for:</strong></p>
<p>Grizzly Peak</p>
<p><strong>Date of Report:</strong></p>
<p>2026-01-31</p>
<p><em>This document contains sensitive information and is intended for

<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the cybersecurity
posture of Grizzly Peak, based on a review of organizational security
controls, an external network scan, and pre-existing risk data. The
assessment was conducted to identify security gaps, evaluate the current
risk landscape, and provide actionable recommendations for
improvement.</p>
<h4 id="key-findings">Key Findings:</h4>
<p>The organization demonstrates a strong technical security posture,
with a well-configured network perimeter and excellent implementation of
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across critical systems. The external
network scan of the target host revealed <strong>no open ports</strong>,
indicating a minimal attack surface and effective firewall
management.</p>
<p>However, a <strong>critical administrative control gap</strong> was
identified: the lack of mandatory security awareness training for new
employees during their onboarding process. This oversight introduces a
significant human-element risk, as new hires are often prime targets for
social engineering and phishing attacks. While an annual training
program is in place for all staff, the initial vulnerability period for
new personnel remains unaddressed.</p>
<h4 id="overall-assessment">Overall Assessment:</h4>
<p>The overall security posture is assessed as
<strong>Moderate</strong>. The robust technical controls significantly
mitigate many common threats, but the identified gap in the onboarding
process presents a high-impact risk that requires immediate attention.
Recommendations in this report focus on closing this administrative gap
to elevate the organization’s security maturity.</p>

</table>
<h4 id="analysis">Analysis:</h4>
<p>The organization has successfully implemented MFA across key access
points, which is a critical defense against credential theft and
unauthorized access. However, the failure to provide security awareness
training to new hires represents the most significant finding from this
review. New employees are not equipped from day one to recognize and
report security threats, creating a window of vulnerability for the
entire organization.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed to identify the external attack surface

<h4 id="analysis-1">Analysis:</h4>
<p>No open ports were detected on the target system
<code>192.168.1.100</code>. A "closed" state indicates that the firewall
is actively rejecting connection attempts, which is a secure
configuration. This finding suggests that the host has a minimal network
attack surface and is well-protected by network-level controls.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actionable recommendations are provided to address the
identified risks and improve the overall security posture of Grizzly
Peak.</p>
<h2 id="priority-1-implement-onboarding-security-training-high">Priority
1: Implement Onboarding Security Training (High)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Risk Addressed:</strong> RISK-001</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Develop and implement a
mandatory security awareness training module for all new employees, to
be completed during their first week of employment. This training should
be a prerequisite for gaining full access to corporate systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> This action directly mitigates
the highest-priority risk identified in this assessment. By educating
employees from day one, the organization can significantly reduce its
susceptibility to human-targeted attacks like phishing and social
engineering. The training should cover, at a minimum:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Phishing and spear-phishing recognition.</p></li>
<li><p>Acceptable use of company assets.</p></li>
<li><p>Password and credential security policies.</p></li>
<li><p>Procedures for reporting security incidents.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2
id="priority-2-maintain-strong-network-controls-informational">Priority
2: Maintain Strong Network Controls (Informational)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Risk Addressed:</strong> General Best Practice</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Continue the excellent practice
of maintaining a minimal external attack surface. Regularly review and
audit firewall rules to ensure that only explicitly required ports and
services are accessible.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> The current technical posture is
a significant strength. Proactive maintenance and periodic validation
will ensure this strength is preserved against future changes in the IT
environment or emerging threats.</p></li>
