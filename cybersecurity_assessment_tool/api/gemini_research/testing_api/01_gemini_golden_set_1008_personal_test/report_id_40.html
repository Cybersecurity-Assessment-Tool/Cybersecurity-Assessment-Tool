<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">1. Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for Crestview Analytics. The analysis is based on a combination of a
network vulnerability scan, a review of organizational security controls
via a questionnaire, and an evaluation of pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The assessment reveals a mixed security posture. From a network
perimeter perspective, the organization presents a strong defensive
stance; the external scan of the target IP address
<code>192.168.1.100</code> found no open ports, indicating a
well-configured firewall that significantly reduces the external attack
surface.</p>
<p>However, significant gaps were identified in internal security
policies and procedures. Critical areas of concern include the absence
of multi-factor authentication (MFA) for sensitive data systems, the
lack of a formal employee acceptable use policy, and the failure to
conduct annual security awareness training for all staff. These
deficiencies expose the organization to substantial risks, including
unauthorized data access, insider threats, and susceptibility to social
engineering attacks.</p>
<p>This report details these findings and provides actionable
recommendations to mitigate the identified risks and strengthen the
overall security posture of Crestview Analytics.</p>

<p>The scan concluded that the host was online but reported that all
scanned ports were in a <strong>‘closed‘</strong> state. No open ports
or active services were discovered.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment:</strong> This is a positive security finding. A
lack of open ports on an externally facing system indicates a properly
configured firewall that is effectively minimizing the network attack
surface by denying unsolicited incoming traffic.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">6. Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified
risks and improve the overall security posture of Crestview
Analytics.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="remediate-risk-001-implement-mfa-for-sensitive-data">6.1. Remediate
RISK-001: Implement MFA for Sensitive Data</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediately prioritize and implement a
robust MFA solution for all systems, applications, and databases that
contain sensitive, confidential, or proprietary data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> This will add a critical layer of
security, ensuring that even if user credentials are stolen,
unauthorized access to the organization’s most valuable data is
prevented.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="remediate-risk-002-develop-and-enforce-an-aup">6.2. Remediate
RISK-002: Develop and Enforce an AUP</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop a comprehensive Acceptable Use
Policy (AUP) that clearly defines the rules and responsibilities for all
employees when using company technology and data. This policy should be
formally acknowledged by all staff members.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> An AUP establishes a baseline for
secure behavior, reduces the risk of misuse of company assets, and
provides a framework for disciplinary action in case of
violations.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="remediate-risk-003-establish-annual-security-training">6.3.
Remediate RISK-003: Establish Annual Security Training</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Institute a mandatory, annual security
awareness training program for all employees, including management. This
program should cover current threats such as phishing, ransomware,
password security, and social engineering.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> Regular training reinforces
security best practices and keeps employees vigilant against evolving
cyber threats, transforming the workforce from a potential vulnerability
into a strong line of defense.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">7. Conclusion</h1>
<p>Crestview Analytics has established a strong network perimeter
defense, as evidenced by the clean external scan. However, the
organization’s resilience against cyber threats is undermined by
significant gaps in its internal security controls and policies.</p>
<p>The identified risks—lack of MFA on critical systems, no acceptable
use policy, and insufficient security training—are fundamental and
present a clear and immediate danger to the organization’s data and
operations.</p>
<p>By implementing the recommendations outlined in this report,
Crestview Analytics can effectively mitigate these high-severity risks,
mature its security program, and build a more resilient and secure
operational environment.</p>
