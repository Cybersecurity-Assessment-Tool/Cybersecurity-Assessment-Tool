% --- Section 1: Executive Overview ---
\section{Executive Overview}

This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity risk assessment for Copperhead Cables. The analysis is based on a correlation of network scan data, organizational security control questionnaires, and a review of pre-existing risk registers.

The assessment reveals a critical-risk situation requiring immediate attention. A database server running an unsupported, end-of-life version of MySQL is directly exposed to the network. This technical vulnerability is significantly amplified by a critical gap in access control policy: the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for sensitive data systems.

While the organization demonstrates a solid foundation in security awareness training and policy documentation, the combination of an exposed, vulnerable service and insufficient access controls creates a high-impact, high-likelihood path for a potential data breach.

Immediate remediation should focus on isolating the exposed database via firewall rules, followed by a plan to upgrade the unsupported software and enforce MFA across all sensitive systems.

% --- Section 2: Organizational Information ---
\section{Organizational Information}

The following details were provided for the assessment. This information helps establish the context and scope of the review.

\begin{tabular}{@{}ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Attribute} & \textbf{Value} \\
\midrule
Organization Name & Copperhead Cables \\
Email Domain & \texttt{CopperheadCables.org} \\
Website Domain & \url{www.CopperheadCables.org} \\
External IP Address & \texttt{86.215.131.189} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}

% --- Section 3: Security Control Review ---
\section{Security Control Review}

A review of the organization's security controls was conducted via a questionnaire. The results indicate a strong security culture regarding employee training but reveal a critical weakness in technical access controls.

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\caption{Security Controls Questionnaire Results}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lcc}
\toprule
\textbf{Control Question} & \textbf{Status} & \textbf{Assessment} \\
\midrule
Do you require MFA to access email? & \ding{51} & Compliant \\
Do you require MFA to log into computers? & \ding{51} & Compliant \\
\textbf{Do you require MFA to access sensitive data systems?} & \textbf{\color{red}\ding{55}} & \textbf{Critical Gap} \\
Does your organization have an employee acceptable use policy? & \ding{51} & Compliant \\
Does your organization do security awareness training for new employees? & \ding{51} & Compliant \\
Does your organization do security awareness training annually? & \ding{51} & Compliant \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection*{Analysis of Findings}
The failure to enforce MFA on sensitive data systems is a significant security risk. In the event of a credential compromise, an attacker would have direct access to critical data without needing to bypass a second authentication factor. This gap directly impacts the risk profile of the technical findings detailed in the next section.

% --- Section 4: Technical Scan Results ---
\section{Technical Scan Results}

An external network scan was performed on the target host \texttt{172.16.50.20}. The scan identified one open port running a database service.

\subsection*{Open Ports and Services}
The following service was found to be accessible from the network:

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\caption{Discovered Open Ports}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lllll}
\toprule
\textbf{Port} & \textbf{State} & \textbf{Service} & \textbf{Product} & \textbf{Version} \\
\midrule
3306/tcp & Open & mysql & MySQL & 5.7.33 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection*{Vulnerability Analysis}
The primary finding is the exposed MySQL database service. Further analysis reveals two major issues:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Network Exposure:} The MySQL port (3306) should not be exposed directly to untrusted networks. This allows attackers to directly attempt brute-force attacks, exploit vulnerabilities, or connect with compromised credentials.
    \item \textbf{Unsupported Software:} The identified version, \textbf{MySQL 5.7}, reached its official End-of-Life (EOL) in October 2023. This means it no longer receives security patches from the vendor, and known vulnerabilities will remain unpatched, posing a severe and escalating risk.
\end{enumerate}

% --- Section 5: Correlated Risk Assessment ---
\section{Correlated Risk Assessment}

This section synthesizes the findings from the security control review, technical scan, and pre-existing risk data to provide a holistic view of the current security posture.

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\caption{Summary of Identified Risks}
\begin{tabular}{@{}p{0.3\linewidth} p{0.5\linewidth} p{0.15\linewidth}}
\toprule
\textbf{Risk Name} & \textbf{Overview} & \textbf{Severity} \\
\midrule
\textbf{Exposed End-of-Life Database Service} & Port 3306 is open, exposing a MySQL 5.7.33 database. This version is no longer supported with security patches. This finding confirms and elevates the pre-existing "Database Exposure" risk. & \color{severitycritical}\textbf{Critical} \\
\addlinespace
\textbf{Insufficient Access Control for Sensitive Systems} & The lack of MFA on sensitive data systems, such as the exposed database, removes a critical layer of defense. A single password compromise could lead to a full data breach. & \color{severityhigh}\textbf{High} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

% --- Section 6: Recommendations ---
\section{Recommendations}

The following prioritized actions are recommended to mitigate the identified risks and improve the overall security posture of Copperhead Cables.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{[Immediate] Implement Firewall Rules to Restrict Access:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Action:} Immediately configure network firewalls to deny all public access to TCP port 3306 on the host \texttt{172.16.50.20}. Access should only be permitted from trusted, internal application servers.
        \item \textbf{Risk Mitigated:} Exposed End-of-Life Database Service.
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{0.5cm}
    
    \item \textbf{[High Priority] Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Action:} Develop and execute a plan to enforce MFA on all access to sensitive data systems, including databases, administrative panels, and critical infrastructure.
        \item \textbf{Risk Mitigated:} Insufficient Access Control for Sensitive Systems.
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{0.5cm}
    
    \item \textbf{[High Priority] Upgrade Unsupported Database Software:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Action:} Plan and execute the migration of the MySQL 5.7.33 database to a currently supported version (e.g., MySQL 8.x). This will ensure the system receives critical security updates.
        \item \textbf{Risk Mitigated:} Exposed End-of-Life Database Service.
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{0.5cm}
    
    \item \textbf{[Medium Priority] Implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN):}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Action:} For long-term secure remote administration, implement a VPN solution. This ensures that all administrative access to internal resources occurs over an encrypted and authenticated tunnel, rather than exposing services directly.
        \item \textbf{Risk Mitigated:} General network exposure risks.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

% --- Section 7: Conclusion ---
\section{Conclusion}
Copperhead Cables has established a good foundation for security through its policies and employee training programs. However, critical technical and procedural gaps currently place the organization at high risk of a data breach. The exposed, unsupported MySQL database, combined with the absence of MFA for sensitive systems, represents a clear and present danger.

By implementing the prioritized recommendations in this report, Copperhead Cables can significantly reduce its risk exposure and strengthen its defense-in-depth security posture.
