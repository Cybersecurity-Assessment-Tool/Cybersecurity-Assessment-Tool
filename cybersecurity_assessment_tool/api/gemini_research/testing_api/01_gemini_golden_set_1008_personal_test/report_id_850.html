<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the cybersecurity
posture for <strong>Harbor Light Foundation</strong>. The assessment is
based on a correlation of organizational data, a review of existing
security controls, and an external network scan.</p>
<p>The organization demonstrates a foundational understanding of
security by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for critical
systems like email and sensitive data access. An employee acceptable use
policy is also in place, which is a positive control.</p>
<p>However, several critical and high-risk gaps were identified that
significantly increase the organization’s vulnerability to common cyber
threats. The most pressing concerns are the complete absence of a
security awareness training program for both new and existing employees,
and the lack of mandatory MFA for workstation logins. These deficiencies
create substantial risk, particularly from phishing, social engineering,
and credential compromise attacks.</p>
<p>The external network scan of the target IP address,
<code>[Target IP]</code>, did not identify any open ports. This suggests
a properly configured firewall is in place, which is a strong defensive
measure for the network perimeter.</p>
<p>Immediate action should be taken to address the identified gaps in
employee training and endpoint security to build a more resilient and
secure operational environment.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network vulnerability scan was performed to identify
exposed services and potential vulnerabilities on the public-facing
infrastructure.</p>

<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> 2026-01-31</p></li>

</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>The absence of open ports is a positive finding. It indicates that
the network perimeter firewall is correctly configured to block
unsolicited inbound traffic, effectively reducing the external attack
surface. No publicly exposed services were detected on the scanned
host.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the risks identified in the previous section, the following
actions are recommended to improve the overall security posture of
<strong>Harbor Light Foundation</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for All Workstation Logins (Addresses
RISK-001):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Deploy a mandatory Multi-Factor
Authentication solution for all employee computers (desktops and
laptops). This could include methods like push notifications,
authenticator app codes, or physical security keys.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> This control provides a critical
layer of defense against credential theft. Even if an attacker obtains a
user’s password, they will be unable to log in without the second
factor, preventing unauthorized access and lateral movement.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish a Comprehensive Security Awareness Training
Program (Addresses RISK-002 &amp; RISK-003):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop and implement a formal security
awareness training program. This program must include:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Mandatory Onboarding Training:</strong> All new hires
must complete a security training module before being granted full
access to systems. This should cover the acceptable use policy, data
handling, and how to identify and report phishing attempts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Annual Refresher Training:</strong> All employees must
complete a security awareness course at least once per year to stay
informed about evolving threats.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Phishing Simulations:</strong> Conduct periodic,
simulated phishing campaigns to test employee vigilance and provide
targeted, just-in-time training to those who click malicious
links.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> An educated workforce is the
first line of defense. A robust training program drastically reduces the
likelihood of a successful social engineering or phishing attack, which
is the most common initial access vector for breaches.</p></li>
</ul></li>
