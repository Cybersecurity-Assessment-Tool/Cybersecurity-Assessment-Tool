% 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
\section*{1. Executive Summary}

This report provides a cybersecurity assessment for \textbf{Iron River Finance}. The analysis is based on a combination of organizational data, a security controls questionnaire, pre-existing risk information, and a recent network scan.

While the organization demonstrates a strong commitment to security policies and controls—as evidenced by a perfect score on the security questionnaire—a critical technical vulnerability has been identified that requires immediate attention. 

The network scan discovered an open service on an internal host (\texttt{10.5.5.5:8080}) that explicitly identifies itself as a \textbf{``TOP SECRET DB''}. This finding directly contradicts a pre-existing risk assessment which incorrectly labeled this port as a secure false positive. The exposure of a potentially sensitive database interface on the network constitutes a severe information disclosure vulnerability and presents a significant risk of unauthorized data access.

Immediate action is required to investigate, secure, and restrict access to this service. This report details the findings and provides prioritized recommendations to mitigate this critical risk and improve the overall security posture.

% 3. SECURITY CONTROL REVIEW
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
\section*{3. Security Control Review}

A review of the security controls questionnaire indicates that \textbf{Iron River Finance} has implemented key administrative and technical safeguards. All responses confirm that foundational security best practices are in place. This is a positive indicator of security maturity at the policy level.

\begin{table}[h!]

\textbf{Control Question} & \textbf{Status} \\ \midrule
Do you require MFA to access email? & \textcolor{green}{\ding{51}} \\

Does your organization have an employee acceptable use policy? & \textcolor{green}{\ding{51}} \\
Does your organization do security awareness training for new employees? & \textcolor{green}{\ding{51}} \\
Does your organization do security awareness training for all employees at least once per year? & \textcolor{green}{\ding{51}} \\ \bottomrule

% 4. TECHNICAL SCAN RESULTS
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
\section*{4. Technical Scan Results}

A network scan was performed on the internal network to identify active services. The scan revealed a critical finding that requires immediate investigation.

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{}llll@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Host IP} & \textbf{Port} & \textbf{State} & \textbf{Service Information} \\ \midrule
\texttt{10.5.5.5} & 8080/tcp & OPEN & HTTP Title: \textbf{\textcolor{darkred}{TOP SECRET DB}} \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Open Ports and Services Detected.}
\end{table}

\subsection*{Analysis of Findings}
The scan identified an open HTTP service on port \texttt{8080} of the host \texttt{10.5.5.5}. The title of the web page served by this port is \textbf{``TOP SECRET DB''}. This is a severe information disclosure vulnerability. The title strongly suggests that this service is an interface to a highly sensitive database. Exposing such a system on the network, even internally, without stringent access controls creates a high-value target for any potential attacker who gains a foothold on the network.

\textbf{Crucially, this technical finding invalidates the pre-existing risk assessment which claimed this port was secure.}

% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
% 5. RISK ASSESSMENT & CORRELATION
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
\section*{5. Risk Assessment \& Correlation}

This section synthesizes the technical findings with the pre-existing risk data. A significant discrepancy was identified, elevating the overall risk profile.

\subsection*{Outdated Risk Information}
The previous risk register contained the following entry, which is now considered inaccurate and outdated:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Risk Name:} Port 8080 Secured
    \item \textbf{Overview:} Port 8080 is confirmed secure and false positive.
    \item \textbf{Severity:} 0.0 (Informational)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Newly Identified Critical Risk}
Based on the technical scan, the risk associated with port 8080 has been re-evaluated and escalated to \textbf{Critical}.

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{}p{0.15\textwidth}p{0.2\textwidth}p{0.15\textwidth}p{0.4\textwidth}@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Risk ID} & \textbf{Risk Name} & \textbf{Severity} & \textbf{Description} \\ \midrule
\textbf{CR-001} & Exposed Sensitive Database Interface & \textbf{\textcolor{darkred}{Critical (9.8)}} & The service on \texttt{10.5.5.5:8080} exposes an HTTP title of ``TOP SECRET DB''. This constitutes a severe information disclosure and indicates a high-value database is accessible on the network. This finding invalidates the previous assessment that this port was a false positive. \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Updated Risk Register.}

% 6. RECOMMENDATIONS
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
\section*{6. Recommendations}

The following actions are recommended to address the identified critical risk and improve the security posture of \textbf{Iron River Finance}.

\subsection*{Immediate Actions (Within 24 Hours)}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Investigate Service:} Immediately identify the owner and purpose of the application running on \texttt{10.5.5.5:8080}. Determine the sensitivity of the data it contains.
    \item \textbf{Restrict Access:} If the service is confirmed to be sensitive, apply host-based or network-based firewall rules to restrict all access to the port immediately, allowing connections only from explicitly authorized administrative hosts.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Short-Term Actions (1-2 Weeks)}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Enforce Authentication:} Ensure that strong, multi-factor authentication (MFA) and role-based access controls are enforced for the application. Anonymous access must be disabled.
    \item \textbf{Network Segmentation:} Review and enhance network segmentation to isolate critical database systems from user-facing networks. Sensitive systems should not be discoverable from general workstations.
    \item \textbf{Remove Sensitive Banners:} Reconfigure the application to remove or generalize any identifying information, such as the "TOP SECRET DB" title, from its HTTP headers and page content.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Long-Term Actions (1-3 Months)}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Review Risk Assessment Process:} Conduct a post-mortem to understand why the risk on port 8080 was previously misclassified. Improve the vulnerability validation and risk assessment methodology to prevent such errors in the future.
    \item \textbf{Implement Continuous Monitoring:} Deploy an automated and continuous vulnerability scanning solution for the internal network to detect and alert on new or re-emerging exposures in a timely manner.
\end{enumerate}
