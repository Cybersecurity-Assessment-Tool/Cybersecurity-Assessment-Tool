<p><strong>Cybersecurity Posture Assessment Report</strong>
<strong>Prepared for:</strong><br />
Sovereign Trust <strong>Date of Report:</strong><br />
2026-01-31 <em>This report contains sensitive information and should be
handled with care.</em></p>
</div>
<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity assessment for
Sovereign Trust, based on an analysis of network scan data,
organizational security controls, and pre-existing risk documentation.
The assessment synthesizes these data points to provide a holistic view
of the organization’s current security posture.</p>
<p>The analysis revealed several critical and high-severity risks that
require immediate attention. Key findings include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Critical Database Exposure:</strong> An externally
accessible MySQL database was identified running on an End-of-Life (EOL)
version (5.7.33). EOL software no longer receives security patches,
exposing the system to a wide range of known vulnerabilities. This
finding validates and elevates the pre-existing "Database Exposure"
risk.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Critical Access Control Gap:</strong> Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) is not enforced for accessing email. As email is a
primary target for phishing and account takeover attacks, this
represents a significant vulnerability in the organization’s security
perimeter.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>High-Risk Onboarding Process:</strong> New employees do
not receive mandatory security awareness training. This oversight makes
the organization more susceptible to social engineering attacks, as new
hires are often targeted by malicious actors.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These findings indicate a security posture with significant
weaknesses that could be exploited by attackers to compromise sensitive
data, disrupt operations, or gain unauthorized access to internal
systems. This report outlines specific, actionable recommendations to
mitigate these risks and strengthen the overall security framework.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following details were provided for the assessment.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Organization Name:</strong> Sovereign Trust</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Monitored External IP:</strong>

</ul>
<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A review of the organization’s security controls was conducted via a
questionnaire. The responses are summarized below. Gaps in security best
practices are marked with <span style="color: red"></span> and represent
areas of increased risk.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-control-gaps">Analysis of Control
Gaps</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>No MFA for Email:</strong> This is a critical security
gap. Email accounts are high-value targets for attackers seeking to
conduct phishing campaigns, impersonate employees, or gain a foothold
within the network. The absence of MFA significantly lowers the barrier
for an account compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Security Training for New Employees:</strong> Failing
to train new hires on security policies and threat awareness leaves a
critical window of vulnerability. New employees are less likely to
recognize sophisticated phishing attempts or understand data handling
policies, making them prime targets for social engineering.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed on the target system to
identify open ports and exposed services.</p>

Technical Findings</h2>
<p>The scan identified an open MySQL port (3306), which is consistent
with the pre-existing risk documentation. The most critical finding is
the software version in use:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>End-of-Life (EOL) Software:</strong> MySQL version 5.7
reached its official End-of-Life in October 2023. This means it no
longer receives security updates, bug fixes, or patches from the
developer. Running EOL software on an internet-facing system presents a
severe and unjustifiable risk, as any vulnerabilities discovered after
this date will remain unpatched and exploitable.</p></li>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following recommendations are prioritized to address the
identified risks in a structured manner.</p>
<h2 id="immediate-actions-priority-critical">Immediate Actions
(Priority: Critical)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Restrict Database Access:</strong> Immediately implement
firewall rules to block all public access to port 3306 on IP
<code>172.16.50.20</code>. Access should be restricted to a whitelist of
trusted IP addresses or be accessible only via a secure Virtual Private
Network (VPN).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enforce MFA for Email:</strong> Immediately enable and
enforce MFA for all email accounts. This is the single most effective
control to prevent unauthorized account access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Plan Database Migration:</strong> Begin planning the
migration from MySQL 5.7 to a currently supported version (e.g., MySQL
8.x or a managed cloud equivalent). This is essential to mitigate the
risks associated with EOL software.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="short-term-actions-priority-high">Short-Term Actions (Priority:
High)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement New Hire Training:</strong> Develop and
integrate a mandatory security awareness training module into the new
employee onboarding process. This should be completed within the first
week of employment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Vulnerability Scan:</strong> Perform an
authenticated vulnerability scan on the server hosting the MySQL
database to identify specific Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
(CVEs) affecting version 5.7.33. This will provide a clear picture of
the exploitable flaws while the migration is being planned.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="long-term-strategic-improvements">Long-Term Strategic
Improvements</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Establish a Software Lifecycle Policy:</strong> Create
and enforce a formal policy for managing software lifecycles. This
policy should include tracking EOL dates for all critical software and
planning for upgrades or replacements well in advance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Security Audits:</strong> Schedule regular,
independent security audits and penetration tests to proactively
identify and remediate vulnerabilities in the future.</p></li>
