<h1 id="executive-overview">Executive Overview</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity assessment for
<strong>Sterling Silver</strong>, based on a technical network scan, a
review of organizational security controls, and an analysis of known
risks. The evaluation was conducted on 2026-01-31.</p>
<p>The assessment reveals a mixed security posture. On one hand, the
technical scan of the target host (<code>192.168.1.100</code>) indicates
a very strong network security configuration, with no open ports
detected. This significantly reduces the external attack surface of the
scanned asset and is a commendable finding.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a review of organizational security controls
identified several critical gaps. The most significant risks stem from
the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers
and accessing sensitive data systems. These gaps expose the organization
to significant risk from credential theft and unauthorized access.
Furthermore, the absence of annual security awareness training for all
employees constitutes a high risk, as it increases susceptibility to
social engineering and phishing attacks.</p>
<p>Our primary recommendations focus on the immediate implementation of
a comprehensive MFA strategy and the establishment of a recurring
security training program to mitigate these identified risks
effectively.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed to identify exposed services and
potential vulnerabilities on the specified target system.</p>
<h2 id="nmap-scan-192.168.1.100">Nmap Scan:
<code>192.168.1.100</code></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> 2026-01-31</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Target IP:</strong> <code>192.168.1.100</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> UP</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Findings:</strong> The scan concluded that the host is online
and responsive. However, <strong>no open TCP or UDP ports were
discovered</strong>. All other scanned ports were reported as being in a
‘closed‘ state.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> A host with no open ports presents a
minimal network attack surface. This is an excellent security posture,
indicating that the device is likely protected by a well-configured
firewall or has no network-facing services running. This configuration
adheres to the principle of least privilege and is a significant
strength.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes findings from the security control review
and technical scan to provide a consolidated list of identified risks.
As no pre-existing vulnerabilities were reported, the following risks
are derived directly from this assessment.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis, the following actionable recommendations are
provided to enhance the cybersecurity posture of <strong>Sterling
Silver</strong>. Recommendations are prioritized by severity.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>[Critical] Deploy MFA for Sensitive System
Access:</strong> Immediately prioritize the implementation of MFA on all
systems classified as containing sensitive or critical data. This is the
single most effective control to prevent unauthorized access to key
organizational assets.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>[Critical] Enforce MFA for Endpoint Logon:</strong>
Implement MFA for all user logins to company computers (desktops and
laptops). This dramatically increases the difficulty for an attacker to
gain an initial foothold in the network, even with stolen credentials.
Solutions like Windows Hello for Business, Duo, or other third-party
tools can be leveraged.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>[High] Establish a Mandatory Annual Security Training
Program:</strong> Develop and enforce a security awareness training
program that is mandatory for all employees on an annual basis. This
program should cover current threats such as phishing, ransomware, and
proper data handling. Phishing simulations should be used to measure the
program’s effectiveness.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>[Informational] Maintain Strong Network
Hardening:</strong> The excellent network posture of the scanned host
(<code>192.168.1.100</code>) should be used as a baseline standard for
other servers and critical devices within the network. Continue to apply
the principle of least privilege by ensuring that only necessary ports
and services are exposed.</p></li>
