<p><strong>Cybersecurity Posture Report</strong></p>
<p>Prepared for: <strong>Open Door</strong></p>
<p>Date of Report: 2026-01-31</p>
<p><em>This report contains sensitive information and should be handled
with care. Distribution is restricted to authorized personnel

<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the cybersecurity
posture for <strong>Open Door</strong>, based on a review of
organizational security controls, an external network scan, and an
assessment of current risks. The assessment was conducted on
2026-01-31.</p>
<p>The analysis reveals a mixed security posture. The organization has
implemented some positive security controls, such as requiring
multi-factor authentication (MFA) for computer logins and conducting
annual security awareness training for all staff.</p>
<p>However, several critical gaps were identified that expose the
organization to significant risk. These include the absence of MFA for
email and sensitive data systems, which dramatically increases the risk
of account compromise and data breaches. Furthermore, the lack of an
employee acceptable use policy and security training for new hires
creates foundational weaknesses in the security program.</p>
<p>The external network scan did not identify any exposed services on
the target system, which suggests a well-configured firewall or a lack
of public-facing services at that address. While this is a positive
finding from a network perspective, the identified policy and access
control gaps must be addressed urgently. This report outlines
prioritized, actionable recommendations to mitigate these risks and
strengthen the overall security posture.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-gaps">Analysis of Gaps</h2>
<p>The review identified four significant control gaps:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>No MFA for Email:</strong> Email is a primary target for
phishing and account takeover attacks. The lack of MFA makes user
credentials the single point of failure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No MFA for Sensitive Data:</strong> Critical business and
client data are at high risk of unauthorized access and exfiltration
without the protection of MFA.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> An AUP is a
foundational document that sets expectations for employee behavior and
the use of company assets, reducing insider risk.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Security Training for New Hires:</strong> New
employees are often targeted by attackers. Failing to provide immediate
security training leaves a critical window of vulnerability.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed to identify exposed services
and potential vulnerabilities.</p>

</table>
<h2 id="findings">Findings</h2>
<p>The scan completed successfully but did not detect any open TCP or
UDP ports on the target host <code>[Target IP]</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> This result indicates that there are no
publicly accessible services running on this IP address, or that a
firewall is in place that effectively blocks all unsolicited inbound
traffic. From an external network security perspective, this is a strong
defensive posture, as it significantly reduces the attack surface. No
further technical vulnerabilities were identified from this scan.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes findings from the security control review
and the technical scan. While no pre-existing vulnerabilities were
reported and the network scan was clean, the administrative and access
control gaps identified in the questionnaire present a clear and
immediate danger to the organization.</p>

<th style="text-align: left;"><strong>Severity</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Email Account Compromise</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The absence of MFA on email accounts
(<code>OpenDoor.net</code>) makes them highly susceptible to takeover
via phishing or credential stuffing. A compromised email account can
lead to data breaches, financial fraud, and further attacks on partners
and clients.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Critical</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Sensitive Data Breach</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Critical systems lack MFA protection,
allowing an attacker with stolen credentials to gain direct access to
sensitive organizational or client data, potentially leading to severe
financial and reputational damage.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Critical</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of Foundational Policies</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Without an Acceptable Use Policy, the
organization lacks a formal mechanism to govern technology use, define
prohibited activities, and enforce security standards. This increases
the risk of insider threats and inconsistent security practices.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>High</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Inadequate Employee Onboarding</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">New employees are not receiving security
awareness training upon being hired. This makes them significantly more
vulnerable to social engineering and phishing attacks during their
initial, and most vulnerable, period of employment.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>High</strong></td>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified
risks. They are prioritized based on severity and potential impact.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication
(Critical):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediately enable and enforce MFA for
all user access to the email system.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Identify all systems containing
sensitive data and enforce MFA for all privileged and standard user
access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> This is the single most effective
control to prevent unauthorized access and mitigate the risk of
credential-based attacks.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)
(High):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Draft an AUP that clearly defines the
rules for using company networks, devices, and data. Require all
employees to read and acknowledge the policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> An AUP establishes a baseline for
secure behavior, reduces ambiguity, and provides a basis for
disciplinary action if violated.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Integrate Security Training into Onboarding
(High):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Create a mandatory security awareness
training module for all new hires to be completed during their first
week of employment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> This ensures that all employees,
from day one, understand their security responsibilities and can
recognize common threats like phishing.</p></li>
</ul></li>
