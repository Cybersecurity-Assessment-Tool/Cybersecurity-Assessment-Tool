<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity assessment
conducted for <strong>Tidal Wave Sports</strong>. The assessment
incorporated a review of organizational security controls, a technical
network scan of a key internal asset, and an analysis of pre-existing
risks.</p>
<p>The primary finding of this assessment is the presence of
<strong>critical gaps in identity and access management
controls</strong>. The organization does not enforce Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, or access to sensitive
data systems. This represents a significant and immediate risk, as it
greatly increases the likelihood of a successful account compromise via
phishing or credential theft. A secondary high-risk finding is the lack
of security awareness training for new employees, creating a window of
vulnerability during their initial tenure.</p>
<p>On a positive note, the technical network scan of the target host
<code>192.168.1.100</code> revealed no open ports. This indicates a
strong network-level configuration for this specific asset, reducing its
external attack surface.</p>
<p>Immediate remediation efforts should focus on implementing a
comprehensive MFA policy across all critical systems and integrating
security training into the employee onboarding process.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-control-gaps">Analysis of Control
Gaps</h2>
<p>The review identified critical weaknesses in access control and
employee training:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA:</strong> The absence of MFA for email,
computer, and sensitive data access is a critical vulnerability. This
single point of failure allows an attacker with valid credentials (e.g.,
from a phishing attack) to gain unauthorized access to key
organizational resources.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Onboarding Training Gap:</strong> While annual training
is in place, the lack of security training for new hires means that the
newest, and often most vulnerable, employees are not equipped to
identify and resist social engineering or phishing attacks from day
one.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed to identify open ports and services on a
designated target system.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>192.168.1.100</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> 2026-01-31</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="findings">Findings</h2>
<p>The scan confirmed that the target host was online and responsive.
However, the scan reported that all 1000 scanned TCP ports were in a
<strong>‘closed‘</strong> state.</p>
<pre><code>Host is up.
All 1000 scanned ports on 192.168.1.100 are in state: closed</code></pre>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>No open ports or exposed services were discovered on the target host.
From a network perspective, this system is well-hardened and presents a
minimal attack surface. No network-based vulnerabilities were identified
on this host during the assessment.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified
risks and improve the overall security posture of <strong>Tidal Wave

id="risk-001-lack-of-multi-factor-authentication-mfa">RISK-001: Lack of
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Action:</strong> Procure and deploy an MFA
solution across the organization.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tactical Steps:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Enable and enforce MFA for all user accounts on the primary email
platform (e.g., Microsoft 365, Google Workspace).</p></li>
<li><p>Implement MFA for all remote access solutions (e.g.,
VPN).</p></li>
<li><p>Deploy MFA for logging into company-managed computers (e.g., via
Windows Hello for Business, Duo, etc.).</p></li>
<li><p>Enforce MFA for all applications containing sensitive or critical
business data.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> <strong>Critical</strong>. This should
be the top remediation priority.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="risk-002-inadequate-employee-onboarding-security-training">RISK-002:
Inadequate Employee Onboarding Security Training</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Action:</strong> Develop a security awareness
training module specifically for new hires.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tactical Steps:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Integrate a mandatory 30-60 minute security training session into
the formal onboarding process for all new employees, to be completed
within their first week.</p></li>
<li><p>The training should cover, at a minimum: phishing identification,
password security policies, acceptable use of company assets, and how to
report a security incident.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure the employee acceptable use policy is reviewed and signed
as part of this onboarding training.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> <strong>High</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion-1">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The security posture of <strong>Tidal Wave Sports</strong> is
characterized by a mix of strengths and significant weaknesses. While
network-level controls on the assessed asset appear robust, the
organization’s procedural and identity controls are critically
underdeveloped. The lack of Multi-Factor Authentication is the most
severe risk and exposes the organization to a high probability of a
security breach.</p>
<p>By implementing the recommendations outlined in this report,
particularly the rapid deployment of MFA and the enhancement of the
employee training program, <strong>Tidal Wave Sports</strong> can
substantially reduce its risk exposure and build a more resilient
security foundation.</p>
