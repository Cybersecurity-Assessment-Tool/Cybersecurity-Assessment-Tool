<p><strong>Cybersecurity Risk Assessment Report</strong>
<strong>Prepared for:</strong><br />
<strong>Date of Report:</strong><br />
2026-01-31 <strong>Analysis Conducted By:</strong><br />

<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity risk assessment
for , based on an analysis of network scan data, organizational security
controls, and pre-existing risk information. The assessment was
conducted on 2026-01-31.</p>
<p>The analysis revealed several critical and high-severity risks that
require immediate attention. Key findings include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Systemic Remote Access Vulnerability:</strong> The
technical scan identified a server with an exposed Remote Desktop
Protocol (RDP) port (<code>3389</code>). This finding, correlated with
pre-existing risk data, indicates a systemic issue of insecure remote
access, which is a primary vector for ransomware attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Critical Gaps in Access Control:</strong> The
organization does not enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
accessing sensitive data systems. This significantly increases the risk
of a data breach resulting from compromised credentials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Deficient Security Policies and Training:</strong> There
is a complete absence of an employee acceptable use policy and a formal
security awareness training program. This lack of a security-conscious
culture elevates the risk of human error, such as falling victim to
phishing attacks, which could serve as the initial entry point for a
major incident.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The overall security posture of  is considered high-risk. This report
outlines specific, actionable recommendations to mitigate these
findings, prioritizing the most critical vulnerabilities to enhance the
organization’s resilience against cyber threats.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following information was provided for the assessment:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Organization Name:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Email Domain:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Website Domain:</strong>
<code>www.ModernMyth.com</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>External IP Address:</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A review of the organization’s security controls was conducted via a
questionnaire. The responses highlight significant gaps in foundational
security practices. A "No" response indicates a missing control and a
potential area of high risk.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-control-gaps">Analysis of Control
Gaps</h2>
<p>The lack of MFA on sensitive systems, coupled with the absence of
security policies and training, creates a high-risk environment. An
attacker who obtains a single user credential could potentially gain
direct access to critical data. Furthermore, without security training,
employees are more susceptible to social engineering and phishing
attacks, which are the most common methods for stealing credentials.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed to identify externally or internally
exposed services. The scan targeted the host at .</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="open-ports-and-services">Open Ports and
Services</h2>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="technical-analysis">Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>The scan confirms that the host has RDP exposed. RDP is a common
target for brute-force attacks and exploitation of vulnerabilities
(e.g., BlueKeep). Exposing this service without mitigating controls like
a VPN or strict firewall rules is a critical security risk. This finding
corroborates a pre-existing risk related to RDP exposure on another host
(), indicating a pattern of insecure configuration within the
network.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following recommendations are provided to mitigate the identified
risks. They are prioritized based on severity and potential impact.</p>
<h2 id="immediate-actions-to-be-completed-within-7-days">Immediate
Actions (To Be Completed within 7 Days)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Mitigate RDP Exposure:</strong> Immediately close or
firewall port <code>3389</code> on host and any other systems where it
is not essential. Access should be restricted to only authorized IP
addresses. Conduct a network-wide scan to identify and remediate all
other instances of exposed RDP.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Deploy MFA on Sensitive Systems:</strong> Prioritize the
deployment of MFA on all systems classified as containing sensitive or
critical data. This is the single most effective control to prevent
unauthorized access from compromised credentials.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="strategic-actions-to-be-completed-within-90-days">Strategic
Actions (To Be Completed within 90 Days)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Secure Remote Access:</strong> For necessary
administrative access, deploy a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or a Zero
Trust Network Access (ZTNA) solution. All RDP access should be routed
through this secure channel, which should also be protected by
MFA.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> Create
and enforce an AUP that clearly defines the rules for using company IT
assets, data handling, and internet usage. All employees must read and
acknowledge this policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish a Security Awareness Program:</strong>
Implement a mandatory security awareness training program for all
employees. This should be conducted for all new hires upon onboarding
and annually for all staff. The training must cover key topics such as
phishing identification, password security, and social
engineering.</p></li>
