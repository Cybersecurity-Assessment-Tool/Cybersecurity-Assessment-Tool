<h1 id="executive-overview">Executive Overview</h1>
<p>This report provides a consolidated analysis of the cybersecurity
posture for <strong>Nexus Dynamics</strong>. The assessment is based on
a synthesis of three data sources: a network vulnerability scan, a
self-reported organizational security controls questionnaire, and a list
of pre-existing known risks.</p>
<p>The overall security posture presents a mixed landscape. On one hand,
the organization demonstrates a strong commitment to identity and access
management, with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) widely implemented
across critical systems. Furthermore, a technical scan of the target
host <code>192.168.0.5</code> indicates that a previously identified
risk related to an unencrypted web server has been successfully
remediated.</p>
<p>However, a critical gap was identified in the employee onboarding
process. The lack of mandatory security awareness training for new
employees represents a high-risk exposure. This oversight can undermine
other technical controls, as untrained staff are significantly more
susceptible to social engineering attacks such as phishing.</p>
<p>This report details these findings and provides actionable
recommendations to address the identified gap and maintain a robust
security posture.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>

<p>This section evaluates the organization’s security posture based on a
self-reported questionnaire. "Yes" answers indicate that a control is in
place, while "No" answers highlight potential gaps that require
attention.</p>

<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>The organization has implemented a robust MFA strategy, which is a
critical defense against credential theft and unauthorized access.
However, the lack of security awareness training for <strong>new
employees</strong> is a significant vulnerability. The initial days and
weeks of employment are a critical period where new staff are learning
company procedures and may be more easily manipulated by social
engineering tactics. This gap negates some of the benefits of the annual
training program by leaving the organization exposed until the next
cycle.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-1">Analysis</h2>
<p>The scan results are positive. The target host shows that port 80
(HTTP) is closed. This finding is particularly important as it directly
contradicts a pre-existing risk documented in the organization’s risk
register. This indicates that the previously identified vulnerability of
an "Unencrypted Web Server" has been successfully remediated on this
specific asset. No other open ports were detected during this scan.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the consolidated risk assessment, the following actions are
recommended to enhance the security posture of <strong>Nexus
Dynamics</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="high-priority-implement-onboarding-security-training">High
Priority: Implement Onboarding Security Training</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Action:</strong> Develop and mandate a security
awareness training module as a required step in the new employee
onboarding process. This training should be completed within the first
week of employment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Content Focus:</strong> The training should cover, at a
minimum: phishing identification, password security, acceptable use of
company assets, and procedures for reporting security
incidents.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Long-Term Strategy:</strong> Integrate the completion of
this training into the formal HR onboarding checklist to ensure 100%
compliance.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="informational-validate-risk-register">Informational: Validate
Risk Register</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> The technical scan indicates that the
risk of an "Unencrypted Web Server" on host <code>192.168.0.5</code> has
been resolved. The security team should verify if this remediation
applies to all relevant systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Update the official risk
register to reflect that this vulnerability is closed, and document the
date of remediation. This ensures that security resources are focused on
active threats.</p></li>
