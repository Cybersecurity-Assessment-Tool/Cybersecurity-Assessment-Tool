<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for <strong>Iron River Finance</strong>, conducted on 2026-01-31. The
analysis synthesizes data from an external network scan, a security
controls questionnaire, and a review of pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The assessment identified a mixed security posture. On a technical
level, the scanned external asset (<code>192.168.1.100</code>)
demonstrates a strong defensive configuration, with no open ports
detected. This indicates effective firewall management and adherence to
the principle of least privilege at the network perimeter.</p>
<p>However, significant administrative and access control gaps were
identified through the security controls review. The two most critical
findings are the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for sensitive
data systems and the absence of an employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP).
These gaps represent a <strong>Critical</strong> and
<strong>High</strong> risk, respectively, as they expose the
organization to potential data breaches via compromised credentials and
increase the likelihood of insider threats or misuse of company
assets.</p>
<p>Immediate remediation should focus on implementing MFA for all
sensitive systems and developing a formal AUP to be distributed to all
employees.</p>

<h4 id="analysis">Analysis:</h4>
<p>The organization has successfully implemented MFA for email and
computer access, which is a strong foundational control. However, the
lack of MFA on sensitive data systems is a critical oversight.
Additionally, the absence of an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) is a
high-risk governance gap, as it fails to establish clear rules for
employee behavior regarding IT assets.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">3. Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed to identify exposed services
and potential vulnerabilities on the perimeter.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>192.168.1.100</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> 2026-01-31</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> UP</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="port-scan-findings">Port Scan Findings</h2>
<p>The scan revealed that the target host is online and responsive.
However, <strong>no open ports were detected</strong>. All 1000 of the
most common TCP ports were found to be in a ‘closed‘ state.</p>
<h4 id="analysis-1">Analysis:</h4>
<p>This is an excellent security finding. It indicates that the external
firewall is properly configured to deny all unsolicited inbound traffic,
adhering to the principle of least privilege. This significantly reduces
the attack surface of the target system from the internet.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment-summary">4. Risk Assessment
Summary</h1>
<p>This section correlates findings from the security control review,
technical scans, and pre-existing risk data. No pre-existing
vulnerabilities were reported. The primary risks identified stem from
policy and access control gaps.</p>

<p>Based on the findings of this assessment, the following actions are
recommended to mitigate the identified risks and improve the overall
security posture of <strong>Iron River Finance</strong>.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="immediate-actions-1-30-days">Immediate
Actions (1-30 Days)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Systems
(RISK-001):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication on
all applications, databases, and administrative interfaces that process
or store sensitive customer, financial, or proprietary data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Drastically reduces the risk of
unauthorized access due to compromised credentials. This is the highest
priority remediation task.</p></li>
</ul></li>

(RISK-002):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Draft a formal AUP that clearly defines
the rules for using company networks, computers, and data. The policy
should be reviewed by legal/HR, and all employees must read and formally
acknowledge it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Establishes a clear security baseline
for all employees, reduces legal liability, and mitigates risks
associated with insider threats and misuse of assets.</p></li>
