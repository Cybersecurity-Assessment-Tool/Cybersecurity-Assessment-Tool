<h1 id="executive-overview">Executive Overview</h1>
<p>The primary objective of this assessment was to evaluate the current
security posture of <strong>Falcon Heavy</strong> by correlating
organizational policies, existing risks, and technical
vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Due to data corruption in the technical scan and current risk inputs,
this analysis focuses on critical policy and procedural gaps identified
through the security controls questionnaire. The assessment reveals
significant risks related to access control, corporate policy, and
employee security training.</p>
<p>Key findings include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Critical Risk:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
is not enforced for accessing sensitive data systems, leaving critical
assets vulnerable to unauthorized access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>High Risk:</strong> The absence of a formal Employee
Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) creates ambiguity regarding security
responsibilities and acceptable behavior. * <strong>High Risk:</strong>
New employees do not receive security awareness training during
onboarding, representing a missed opportunity to establish a
security-conscious culture from day one.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>While the organization has implemented some positive security
controls, such as MFA for email and computer logins, the identified gaps
require immediate attention to mitigate potential threats.
Recommendations are provided to address each finding systematically.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-gaps">Analysis of Gaps</h2>
<p>The questionnaire reveals three significant gaps in the
organization’s security program:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA on Sensitive Systems:</strong> The lack of MFA on
systems holding sensitive data is a critical vulnerability. Should an
attacker compromise a user’s credentials, they would have direct access
to the organization’s most valuable information.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> An AUP is a
foundational document that defines how employees can use company
resources. Without one, there is no formal standard for user behavior,
data handling, or consequences for misuse, increasing the risk of
insider threats and accidental data loss.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>New Employee Training:</strong> Failing to train new
employees on security best practices during onboarding means they may be
unaware of company policies, common threats like phishing, and their
role in protecting the organization. This gap makes them a primary
target for social engineering attacks.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p><strong>The network scan data provided for this assessment was found
to be corrupted and could not be parsed.</strong></p>
<p>A technical network scan is essential for identifying vulnerabilities
at the infrastructure level, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Open ports and exposed services.</p></li>
<li><p>Outdated software with known vulnerabilities (e.g.,
CVEs).</p></li>
<li><p>Insecure service configurations.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Without this data, a complete picture of the organization’s external
attack surface cannot be formed. It is strongly recommended to conduct a
new network scan against the target IP address () to complete this
portion of the assessment.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This risk assessment is based on the findings from the Security
Control Review. The severity level (Critical, High, Medium, Low) is
assigned based on the potential impact of the risk and the likelihood of
its occurrence. Due to incomplete input data, pre-existing risks could
not be included.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actionable recommendations are provided to address the
identified risks and strengthen the overall security posture of
<strong>Falcon Heavy</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="immediate-actions-1-30-days">Immediate Actions (1-30 Days)</h2>
<dl>
<dt>For RISK-001:</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Systems.</strong> Prioritize the
deployment of a robust Multi-Factor Authentication solution across all
applications and systems that store, process, or transmit sensitive or
critical data. This is the single most effective control to prevent
unauthorized access.</p>
</dd>
<dt>For RISK-002:</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP).</strong> Draft a formal AUP that clearly outlines the rules for
using company IT assets, data handling responsibilities, and the
consequences for violations. Require all current employees to read and
acknowledge the policy.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="short-term-actions-30-90-days">Short-Term Actions (30-90
Days)</h2>
<dl>
<dt>For RISK-003:</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>Integrate Security Training into Onboarding.</strong> Develop
a mandatory security awareness training module for the new employee
onboarding process. This module should cover key topics such as
phishing, password hygiene, data handling, and the new AUP.</p>
</dd>
<dt>For Data Integrity:</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>Conduct a New Network Scan.</strong> Perform a new,
authenticated and unauthenticated, external network scan to gather the
necessary technical data. This will allow for a complete assessment of
the organization’s attack surface and identify any unpatched or
misconfigured services.</p>
