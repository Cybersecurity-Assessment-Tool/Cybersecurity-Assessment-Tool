<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive assessment of the cybersecurity
posture for <strong>Nexus Dynamics</strong>. The analysis is based on a
synthesis of data from three sources: a network vulnerability scan, an
organizational security controls questionnaire, and a review of
pre-existing risk data.</p>
<p><strong>Important Note on Data Integrity:</strong> During the
analysis phase, it was discovered that the data feeds for the
<strong>Network Scan (Input 1)</strong> and <strong>Current Risks (Input
3)</strong> were corrupted and could not be parsed. Consequently, this
assessment is primarily based on the self-reported data from the
organizational security controls questionnaire.</p>
<p>The review of the security controls questionnaire revealed a solid
foundation in several key areas, including the enforcement of
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive systems, and
the presence of an acceptable use policy. However, two significant gaps
were identified that present a high level of risk to the
organization:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Endpoint MFA:</strong> Employee computers do not
require MFA for login, exposing the organization to significant risk
from compromised credentials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inadequate Security Training Cadence:</strong> Security
awareness training is not conducted annually for all employees,
increasing susceptibility to phishing and social engineering
attacks.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This report details these findings and provides actionable,
prioritized recommendations to mitigate the identified risks and
strengthen the overall security posture of <strong>Nexus
Dynamics</strong>. A full technical assessment is recommended once the
data integrity issues with the network scanner have been resolved.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-gaps">Analysis of Gaps</h2>
<p>The questionnaire identified two primary control gaps:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Endpoint MFA:</strong> The absence of MFA on computer
logins is a critical weakness. If an employee’s password is stolen or
guessed, an attacker can gain direct access to their workstation and,
subsequently, the internal network.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Annual Security Training:</strong> While new hires
receive training, the lack of an annual refresher for all staff means
that knowledge of evolving threats diminishes over time. This makes
employees more likely to fall victim to sophisticated phishing or social
engineering campaigns.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An attempt was made to perform a technical network scan against the
organization’s external infrastructure.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not Available</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Status:</strong> <strong><span
style="color: red">FAILED</span></strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Finding:</strong> The raw data output from the network
scanning tool was found to be corrupted and unreadable. As a result, no
analysis of open ports, running services, or potential software
vulnerabilities could be performed. It is critical to resolve the
underlying issue with the scanning infrastructure to enable future
technical assessments.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This risk assessment is based on the findings from the Security
Control Review. The pre-existing risk data was unavailable for
correlation due to data corruption. The identified risks are prioritized
by severity.</p>

</div>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following prioritized recommendations are provided to address the
identified risks and improve the overall security posture of
<strong>Nexus Dynamics</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="critical-priority">Critical Priority</h2>
<dl>
<dt>REC-001: Implement Mandatory MFA for All Endpoints</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Deploy a robust Multi-Factor Authentication
solution for all employee computer and server logins. Solutions such as
Windows Hello for Business, Duo Security, or Okta should be evaluated
and implemented. <strong>Justification:</strong> This is the single most
effective control to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access resulting
from stolen credentials (Risk ID R-001). It is a foundational element of
a modern, zero-trust security architecture.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="high-priority">High Priority</h2>
<dl>
<dt>REC-002: Establish an Annual Security Awareness Training
Program</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Institute a mandatory, annual security
awareness training program for all staff, including management. This
program should be updated yearly to cover the latest threat vectors,
with a strong emphasis on phishing, ransomware, and social engineering.
<strong>Justification:</strong> A well-trained workforce is a critical
layer of defense. Regular training reduces the organization’s "human
attack surface" and mitigates the risk of security incidents caused by
employee error (Risk ID R-002).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="informational">Informational</h2>
<dl>
<dt>REC-003: Remediate Data Source Integrity</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Investigate and resolve the root cause of
the data corruption affecting the network scanner output and the current
risks database. <strong>Justification:</strong> To conduct a complete
and accurate security assessment in the future, all data sources must be
reliable. A comprehensive view of technical vulnerabilities is essential
for effective risk management.</p>
