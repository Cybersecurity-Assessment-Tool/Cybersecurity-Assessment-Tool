<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment for <strong>Crestview Analytics</strong>. The assessment was
conducted by synthesizing organizational data, security control
questionnaire responses, and technical network scan results.</p>
<p>A review of the security control questionnaire revealed several
significant gaps in fundamental security practices. The most critical
findings are the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
accessing email and for logging into company computers. These two issues
expose the organization to a high risk of account compromise, business
email compromise (BEC), and unauthorized access to internal systems. A
further high-risk gap was identified in the lack of annual security
awareness training for all staff, which increases susceptibility to
social engineering attacks.</p>
<p>During the assessment, the provided technical network scan data
(<code>Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON</code>) and the list of current
organizational risks (<code>Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON</code>) were
found to be corrupted and could not be processed. This data integrity
issue prevented a full analysis of the external network perimeter and
correlation with known vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>The overall security posture is assessed as <strong>Medium-High
Risk</strong>. While some foundational controls are in place, the
identified gaps in access control and employee training require
immediate attention. It is strongly recommended that Crestview Analytics
prioritize the implementation of MFA across all critical systems and
establish a recurring security training program. A full rescan of the
external network is also a critical next step.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<h2 id="scan-status">Scan Status</h2>
<p><strong>Analysis Failure:</strong> The provided network scan data
file (<code>Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON</code>) was found to be corrupted
or incomplete. As a result, a technical analysis of open ports, running
services, and potential vulnerabilities on the target IP address ()
could not be performed.</p>
<h2 id="implications">Implications</h2>
<p>Without valid scan data, the organization has no current visibility
into its external attack surface. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Potentially vulnerable services exposed to the internet.</p></li>
<li><p>Outdated software versions with known exploits.</p></li>
<li><p>Misconfigured services that could allow unauthorized
access.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is crucial to resolve the data collection issue and perform a new,
successful scan to identify and mitigate any technical
vulnerabilities.</p>
<h1 id="existing-risk-register-review">Existing Risk Register
Review</h1>
<p><strong>Analysis Failure:</strong> Similar to the technical scan
data, the provided file containing current organizational risks
(<code>Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON</code>) was also corrupted. This
prevented a review of known vulnerabilities and an analysis of risk
management trends within the organization. A healthy risk register is a
key component of a mature security program.</p>
<h1 id="consolidated-risk-assessment">Consolidated Risk Assessment</h1>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified
risks. They are prioritized based on severity and potential impact on
the organization.</p>
<h2 id="priority-1-critical-risks">Priority 1: Critical Risks</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email:</strong> Immediately enforce MFA
for all user accounts accessing the email system
(<code>CrestviewAnalytics.net</code>). This is the single most effective
control to prevent account takeovers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enforce MFA for Endpoint Login:</strong> Deploy and
require MFA for all employees to log into their workstations and
laptops. This significantly strengthens endpoint security and contains
the impact of compromised credentials.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="priority-2-high-risks">Priority 2: High Risks</h2>
<ol start="3">
<li><p><strong>Establish Annual Security Awareness Training:</strong>
Develop and mandate an annual security awareness training program for
all employees. The program should cover current threats such as
phishing, ransomware, and proper data handling.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="priority-3-process-improvement">Priority 3: Process
Improvement</h2>
<ol start="4">
<li><p><strong>Resolve Data Integrity and Rescan:</strong> Investigate
the root cause of the corrupted data outputs from the network scanner
and risk management system. Once resolved, immediately conduct a
comprehensive, authenticated external vulnerability scan of the IP to
identify technical risks.</p></li>
