<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity assessment for
<strong>Brimstone Manufacturing</strong>, based on a review of
organizational security controls, an external network scan, and an
analysis of pre-existing risks. The assessment was conducted on
2026-01-31.</p>
<p>Overall, <strong>Brimstone Manufacturing</strong> demonstrates a
mixed security posture. Positive controls are in place, such as the
mandatory use of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and
computer access, and the implementation of annual security awareness
training for all staff. The external network scan of the target IP
address (<code>[Target IP]</code>) revealed no open ports, which
indicates a strong perimeter firewall configuration that effectively
limits the external attack surface.</p>
<p>However, two significant gaps were identified through the security
questionnaire, introducing critical and high-level risks to the
organization:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Critical Risk:</strong> The absence of MFA for accessing
sensitive data systems. This gap exposes the organization’s most
valuable data to compromise in the event of a credential theft
incident.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>High Risk:</strong> The lack of mandatory security
awareness training for new employees during their onboarding process.
This leaves a critical window of vulnerability where new hires are more
susceptible to social engineering and phishing attacks.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This report details these findings and provides actionable
recommendations to mitigate the identified risks and enhance the
organization’s overall security resilience.</p>

<p>A review of administrative and technical security controls was
conducted via a questionnaire. The results below highlight implemented
controls and identify significant gaps. A green checkmark (<span

’X’ (<span style="color: red"></span>) indicates a control gap that
introduces risk.</p>

<p>The two identified gaps are considered significant weaknesses in the
organization’s defense-in-depth strategy.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>An external network vulnerability scan was performed against the
designated target IP address.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not available in scan data.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="summary-of-findings">Summary of Findings</h2>
<p>The network scan completed successfully but did not identify any open
TCP ports on the target host. This is a positive security finding,
suggesting that the external firewall is properly configured to deny
unsolicited inbound traffic, effectively minimizing the external attack
surface. No services were exposed to the public internet on the scanned
IP address.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section correlates findings from the security control review,
technical scan, and pre-existing risk data. The primary risks identified
stem from gaps in administrative and access controls. No pre-existing
vulnerabilities were provided for this assessment.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actionable recommendations are provided to address the
identified risks and improve the overall security posture of
<strong>Brimstone Manufacturing</strong>.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="immediate-priorities-critical-risk">Immediate
Priorities (Critical Risk)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for All Sensitive Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediately begin a project to identify
all systems and applications containing sensitive data (e.g., financial
records, intellectual property, PII) and enforce MFA for all user
access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> This directly mitigates the risk
of a data breach resulting from stolen credentials, which is a primary
attack vector. This is the single most effective control to implement to
protect critical data.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="near-term-priorities-high-risk">Near-Term
Priorities (High Risk)</h2>
<ol start="2">
<li><p><strong>Integrate Security Training into Employee
Onboarding:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop a mandatory security awareness
training module for all new hires. This training must be completed as
part of the formal onboarding process before system access is
granted.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> This closes a significant window
of vulnerability by ensuring that all employees, from their first day,
understand their security responsibilities, recognize common threats
like phishing, and are familiar with the acceptable use policy.</p></li>
