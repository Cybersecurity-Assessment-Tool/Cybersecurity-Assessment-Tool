<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity assessment
conducted for Iron Oak Furniture. The assessment combined a review of
organizational security controls, an external network scan, and an
analysis of pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The overall security posture presents a mixed landscape. On a
positive note, the technical network scan of the target host
<code>192.168.1.100</code> revealed no open ports, suggesting a strong
firewall configuration and a minimal attack surface for that specific
asset. This is a commendable security practice.</p>
<p>However, significant and high-impact risks were identified in the
organization’s security policies and procedures. The most critical
findings stem from the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
accessing sensitive data systems and for computer logins. Furthermore,
the absence of mandatory annual security awareness training for all
staff leaves the organization vulnerable to evolving social engineering
tactics like phishing.</p>
<p>These gaps substantially increase the risk of unauthorized access,
credential compromise, and data breaches. This report outlines these
risks in detail and provides prioritized, actionable recommendations to
mitigate them and strengthen the organization’s overall defensive
capabilities.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following details were provided for the assessment.</p>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A review of internal security controls was conducted via a
standardized questionnaire. The responses indicate foundational policies
are in place, but critical gaps exist in identity and access management
and ongoing employee training. The table below summarizes the findings,
with a <span style="color: red"></span> indicating a potential security
gap.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed to identify exposed services and
potential vulnerabilities on the perimeter.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Target:</strong> <code>192.168.1.100</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> 2026-01-31</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="summary-of-findings">Summary of Findings</h2>
<p>The host at <code>192.168.1.100</code> was found to be online and
responsive. The scan confirmed that all 1000 scanned TCP ports were in a
<strong>closed</strong> state.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> No open ports or exposed services were
detected on the target host. This is a positive security finding,
indicating that the device is likely protected by a well-configured
firewall that denies unsolicited incoming traffic, significantly
reducing its external attack surface.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section correlates the findings from the security control review
and technical scans. While no technical vulnerabilities were discovered,
critical gaps in administrative controls present a significant risk to
the organization. The following table summarizes the identified risks,

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the risk assessment, the following actions are recommended
to enhance the security posture of Iron Oak Furniture. Recommendations
are prioritized to address the most critical risks first.</p>
<h2 id="immediate-priority-critical-risks">Immediate Priority (Critical
Risks)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for All Sensitive Systems
(RISK-001):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediately deploy a mandatory
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) solution for all user accounts
(including administrative and service accounts) that can access
sensitive data repositories, financial systems, or customer
databases.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> This is the single most effective
control to prevent unauthorized access to critical data in the event of
password compromise. It serves as a crucial compensating control for
other potential weaknesses.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="high-priority">High Priority</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Deploy MFA for Endpoint Logon (RISK-002):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Enforce MFA for all users logging into
their company-issued computers. Solutions like Windows Hello for
Business, Duo, or other third-party integrations can be used.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> Protecting endpoints with MFA
prevents an attacker with stolen credentials from gaining an initial
foothold on the internal network, thereby disrupting attack chains and
preventing lateral movement.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish a Mandatory Annual Security Training Program
(RISK-003):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop and implement a formal security
awareness training program that is mandatory for all employees on an
annual basis. The training should cover current threats such as
phishing, ransomware, and proper data handling.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> The threat landscape is
constantly changing. Annual training ensures that the "human firewall"
is kept up-to-date and resilient against modern social engineering
attacks, reducing the likelihood of a breach caused by human
error.</p></li>
</ul></li>
