<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment conducted for <strong>Copperhead Cables</strong>. The
assessment integrated an external network scan, a review of existing
risks, and an analysis of organizational security controls based on a
questionnaire.</p>
<p>The primary findings indicate significant gaps in foundational
security controls. While the external network scan of the target IP
address revealed no open ports—a positive indicator of a well-configured
perimeter firewall—critical vulnerabilities exist within the
organization’s access control and employee security awareness
policies.</p>
<p>The absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and
computer access represents a <strong>Critical</strong> risk, exposing
the organization to credential theft, business email compromise, and
unauthorized system access. Furthermore, the lack of a formal security
awareness training program for new and existing employees constitutes a
<strong>High</strong> risk, leaving the organization vulnerable to
phishing and other social engineering attacks.</p>
<p>Immediate remediation efforts should focus on implementing MFA across
all critical systems and establishing a comprehensive security awareness
training program to mitigate these identified risks.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-gaps">Analysis of Gaps</h2>
<p>The questionnaire reveals critical deficiencies in two key areas:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Access Control:</strong> The failure to enforce MFA on
email and computer logins is a severe weakness. Email is a primary
target for attackers, and compromised accounts can lead to data breaches
and financial fraud. Unprotected computer logins remove a crucial layer
of defense against unauthorized access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Security Awareness:</strong> The complete absence of a
security awareness training program means employees are likely
unprepared to identify and respond to common threats like phishing,
malware, and social engineering. This significantly increases the
organization’s "human" attack surface.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed to identify exposed services
and potential vulnerabilities.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> No date provided in scan
data.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="findings">Findings</h2>
<p>The scan completed successfully and found <strong>no open TCP or UDP
ports</strong> on the target system.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="interpretation">Interpretation</h2>
<p>This is a strong positive finding. It indicates that a perimeter
firewall is in place and configured correctly to block unsolicited
inbound traffic, adhering to the principle of least privilege. This
significantly reduces the external attack surface and protects internal
systems from direct network-based attacks from the internet. However,
this does not mitigate risks from phishing or other attacks that
originate from within a compromised account or system.</p>
<h1 id="consolidated-risk-assessment">Consolidated Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section correlates findings from the security control review,
technical scan, and pre-existing risk data. No pre-existing
vulnerabilities were provided. The primary risks identified stem from
policy and procedural gaps.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified
risks and improve the overall security posture of <strong>Copperhead
Cables</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for All Email Accounts (Priority:
Immediate)</strong><br />
<em>Rationale:</em> To address the critical risk of business email
compromise.<br />
<em>Action:</em> Enforce MFA for all user accounts on the
<code>CopperheadCables.org</code> email platform. Provide clear
instructions and support to all employees during the rollout.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enforce MFA for Workstation and Remote Access (Priority:
Immediate)</strong><br />
<em>Rationale:</em> To prevent unauthorized access to the internal
network and company devices.<br />
<em>Action:</em> Deploy and mandate the use of MFA for all computer
logins (Windows, macOS) and any remote access solutions (e.g.,
VPN).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish a Security Awareness Training Program
(Priority: High)</strong><br />
<em>Rationale:</em> To reduce the risk of human error and strengthen the
"human firewall."<br />
<em>Action:</em> Procure and implement a security awareness training
solution. The program must include initial training for all new hires
and mandatory annual refresher training for all staff. Conduct regular
phishing simulations to measure effectiveness.</p></li>
