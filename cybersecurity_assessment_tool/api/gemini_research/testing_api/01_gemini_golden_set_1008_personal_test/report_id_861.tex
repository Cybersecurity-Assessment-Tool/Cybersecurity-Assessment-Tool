% --- EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW ---
\section{Executive Overview}
This report provides a comprehensive assessment of the cybersecurity posture for \textbf{Fable \& Lore}. The analysis is based on a review of organizational security controls, a technical network scan, and pre-existing risk documentation.

A \textbf{critical risk} was identified during the technical scan. A service on internal host \texttt{10.5.5.5} port \texttt{8080} presents a web page titled \textbf{"TOP SECRET DB"}. This finding directly contradicts a pre-existing risk assessment which incorrectly labeled this port as a "confirmed secure" false positive. This discrepancy indicates a severe internal threat and a failure in the existing risk validation process.

Furthermore, the organizational review revealed significant gaps in foundational security practices. The lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA) on email accounts presents a critical vulnerability to phishing and account takeover attacks. This is compounded by the absence of an employee acceptable use policy and a formal security awareness training program, creating a high-risk environment susceptible to human error.

Immediate remediation is required for the exposed internal service and the implementation of email MFA. Strategic initiatives must be launched to develop and implement robust security policies and training programs to mature the organization's overall security culture.

% --- ORGANIZATIONAL INFORMATION ---
\section{Organizational Information}
The following details were provided for the assessment.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Organization Name:} Fable \& Lore
    \item \textbf{Email Domain:} \texttt{FableLore.com}
    \item \textbf{Website Domain:} \url{www.FableLore.com}
    \item \textbf{External IP Address:} \seqsplit{\texttt{171.19.210.238}}
\end{itemize}

% --- SECURITY CONTROL REVIEW ---
\section{Security Control Review (Questionnaire Analysis)}
A review of the organization's security controls was conducted via a questionnaire. The responses highlight critical deficiencies in user access security and corporate governance. "No" answers indicate significant gaps that increase organizational risk.

% --- TECHNICAL SCAN RESULTS ---
\section{Technical Scan Results}
A network scan was performed on the specified internal target to identify open ports and exposed services.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Target IP Address:} \texttt{10.5.5.5}
\end{itemize}

The scan revealed one open port with a highly concerning service banner.

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\caption{Open Port Analysis for \texttt{10.5.5.5}}
\begin{tabular}{l l l p{0.4\linewidth}}
\toprule
\textbf{Port} & \textbf{State} & \textbf{Service} & \textbf{Details / Banner} \\
\midrule
8080/tcp & Open & http-title & \cellcrit \textbf{TOP SECRET DB} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection*{Analysis of Findings}
The discovery of an open port is not inherently a vulnerability. However, the service banner "TOP SECRET DB" on port 8080 is a critical finding. This suggests an undocumented, and likely unsecured, database interface is exposed on the internal network. This finding directly contradicts the information provided in \textit{Input\_3\_Current\_Risks\_JSON}, which had previously dismissed this port as a secure false positive. This indicates a severe misconfiguration and a breakdown in the risk assessment process.

% --- RISK ASSESSMENT ---
\section{Risk Assessment}
Based on the correlation of all data inputs, the following risks have been identified and prioritized. The risk from the pre-existing list regarding Port 8080 has been invalidated and superseded by risk \textbf{CSA-RISK-001}.

\begin{table}[h!]

\toprule
\textbf{Risk ID} & \textbf{Risk Name} & \textbf{Description} & \textbf{Severity} \\
\midrule
\cellcrit CSA-RISK-001 & Exposed Sensitive Database Interface & An HTTP service on port 8080 of host \texttt{10.5.5.5} is titled "TOP SECRET DB", indicating a potentially unsecured interface to sensitive data. A previous assessment incorrectly marked this as a false positive. & \textbf{Critical} \\
\addlinespace
\cellcrit CSA-RISK-002 & Lack of MFA on Email Accounts & The absence of MFA on the \texttt{FableLore.com} email domain exposes the organization to account takeover via phishing, credential stuffing, and password spray attacks. & \textbf{Critical} \\
\addlinespace
\cellhigh CSA-RISK-003 & Insufficient Security Culture \& Governance & The lack of a formal acceptable use policy and security awareness training program leaves the organization vulnerable to insider threats and human error. & \textbf{High} \\

% --- RECOMMENDATIONS ---
\section{Recommendations}
The following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified risks and improve the overall security posture of \textbf{Fable \& Lore}.

\subsection*{Immediate Actions (To Be Completed Within 72 Hours)}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Investigate and Secure Exposed Database (CSA-RISK-001):}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Immediately identify the owner and purpose of the service running on \texttt{10.5.5.5:8080}.
        \item Determine the nature of the data accessible via this interface.
        \item If the service is not business-critical, disable it immediately.
        \item If required, implement strict firewall rules to restrict access to only authorized personnel and enforce strong authentication controls.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Review and Update Risk Register:} The existing risk assessment process failed to identify a critical vulnerability. Conduct a review of how risks are validated and update procedures to prevent future misclassifications.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{High-Priority Actions (To Be Completed Within 30 Days)}
\begin{enumerate}
    \setcounter{enumi}{2} % Continue numbering
    \item \textbf{Enforce MFA for Email (CSA-RISK-002):} Procure and deploy a multi-factor authentication solution for all email accounts. Make MFA mandatory for all users without exception.
