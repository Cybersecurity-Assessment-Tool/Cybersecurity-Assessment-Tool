% --- EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ---
\section*{Executive Summary}
This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity assessment for \textbf{Nomad Gear Co.}, synthesizing data from network scans, an organizational security questionnaire, and a review of pre-existing risks. The analysis reveals critical gaps in organizational security controls, which present a more immediate threat than the technical findings from the targeted network scan.

The most significant risks identified are the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer access, and a lack of a formal security awareness training program for employees. These deficiencies expose the organization to a high risk of phishing, credential theft, and subsequent ransomware attacks.

On a technical level, the network scan of the target host \texttt{192.168.0.5} did not reveal any open ports or active vulnerabilities. This indicates a secure configuration for the scanned device. Notably, a pre-existing risk concerning an "Unencrypted Web Server" on Port 80 was not validated on this host, as the port was found to be closed. This may indicate successful remediation or that the risk pertains to a different asset.

Recommendations are prioritized to address the most critical risks first, focusing on the immediate implementation of MFA and the development of a security awareness training program.

% --- ORGANIZATIONAL INFORMATION ---
\section{Organizational Information}
The following details were provided for the assessment.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Organization Name:} Nomad Gear Co.
    \item \textbf{Email Domain:} \texttt{NomadGearCo.org}
    \item \textbf{Website Domain:} \seqsplit{\url{www.NomadGearCo.org}}
    \item \textbf{External IP Address:} \texttt{138.163.188.28}
\end{itemize}

% --- SECURITY CONTROL REVIEW ---
\section{Security Control Review}
The following table summarizes the organization's responses to a security controls questionnaire. "No" answers indicate significant gaps in the security posture and are highlighted as areas for immediate improvement.

\begin{tabular}{p{0.6\textwidth} c c}
\toprule
\textbf{Control Question} & \textbf{Response} & \textbf{Status} \\
\midrule
Do you require MFA to access email? & No & \textcolor{red}{\xmark} \\
Do you require MFA to log into computers? & No & \textcolor{red}{\xmark} \\
Do you require MFA to access sensitive data systems? & Yes & \textcolor{green}{\cmark} \\
Does your organization have an employee acceptable use policy? & Yes & \textcolor{green}{\cmark} \\
Does your organization do security awareness training for new employees? & No & \textcolor{red}{\xmark} \\
Does your organization do security awareness training for all employees at least once per year? & No & \textcolor{red}{\xmark} \\

% --- TECHNICAL SCAN RESULTS ---
\section{Technical Scan Results}
A network scan was performed to identify open ports and services on the specified target system.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Target IP Address:} \texttt{192.168.0.5}
    \item \textbf{Scan Tool:} Nmap
\end{itemize}

The scan revealed a minimal attack surface for the target host, with no open ports detected. The status of scanned ports is detailed below.

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\caption{Port Scan Results for \texttt{192.168.0.5}}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c}
\toprule
\textbf{Port} & \textbf{State} & \textbf{Service} & \textbf{Product / Version} \\
\midrule
80/tcp & closed & http & N/A \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\paragraph{Analysis:} The scanned host \texttt{192.168.0.5} appears to be securely configured from a network perspective, with no exposed services. The pre-existing risk "Unencrypted Web Server" was not confirmed on this host, as port 80 was found to be closed.

% --- RISK ASSESSMENT SUMMARY ---
\section{Risk Assessment Summary}
The following table consolidates risks from the security control review, technical scans, and pre-existing vulnerability data. Risks are rated based on their potential impact on the organization.

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\caption{Consolidated Risk Register}
\begin{tabular}{p{0.3\textwidth} p{0.5\textwidth} c}
\toprule
\textbf{Risk Name} & \textbf{Description} & \textbf{Severity} \\
\midrule
\textbf{Lack of MFA on Email} & Without MFA, a compromised password is all an attacker needs to gain full access to an employee's mailbox, leading to data breaches and further attacks. & \textbf{Critical} \\
\addlinespace
\textbf{Lack of MFA on Endpoints} & Stolen credentials can be used to log into company computers, granting attackers network access and a foothold to launch wider attacks like ransomware. & \textbf{Critical} \\
\addlinespace
\textbf{No Security Awareness Training} & Employees are not trained to recognize or report phishing attempts, making them highly susceptible to social engineering attacks. & \textbf{High} \\
\addlinespace
Unencrypted Web Server \textit{(Not Validated)} & A previously identified risk stated Port 80 was open. The scan of \texttt{192.168.0.5} showed this port as closed, suggesting this risk may be remediated or located on another asset. & Medium \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

% --- RECOMMENDATIONS ---
\section{Recommendations}
Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified risks. They are prioritized from most to least critical.

\subsection*{Priority 1: Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (Critical)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Action:} Immediately enforce MFA for all user access to email (\texttt{NomadGearCo.org}) and for all computer/endpoint logins. This is the single most effective control to prevent unauthorized access from compromised credentials.
    \item \textbf{Tools:} Utilize solutions provided by your email provider (e.g., Microsoft 365, Google Workspace) or third-party identity providers (e.g., Duo, Okta).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Priority 2: Establish a Security Awareness Program (High)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Action:} Develop and implement a mandatory security awareness training program for all employees.
    \item \textbf{Details:}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Onboarding:} All new employees must complete foundational training on topics like phishing, password security, and acceptable use.
            \item \textbf{Annual Refresher:} All staff must complete a training refresher at least once per year to stay current on evolving threats.
            \item \textbf{Phishing Simulations:} Conduct regular, simulated phishing campaigns to test and reinforce employee awareness.
        \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Priority 3: Validate Network-Wide Security Posture (Informational)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Action:} Confirm the status of the "Unencrypted Web Server" risk across all organizational assets.
    \item \textbf{Details:} While the scan of \texttt{192.168.0.5} was clean, it is crucial to perform a comprehensive vulnerability scan across the entire network IP range to ensure no other servers are exposing unencrypted services like HTTP on Port 80.
\end{itemize}
