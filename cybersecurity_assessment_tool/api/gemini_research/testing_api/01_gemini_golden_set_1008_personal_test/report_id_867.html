<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for Silver Leaf Collective, based on a combination of network scanning,
a security controls questionnaire, and a review of pre-existing risk
data. The analysis synthesizes these data points to provide a holistic
view of the organization’s security landscape.</p>
<p>The assessment identified several areas of significant concern
requiring immediate attention. The most critical finding is the external
exposure of a MySQL database service (<code>172.16.50.20:3306</code>).
This service is running an outdated and End-of-Life (EOL) version of
MySQL (5.7.33), which no longer receives security updates, posing a
severe risk of data breach.</p>
<p>Furthermore, critical gaps were identified in administrative
controls. The organization lacks a formal employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP) and does not provide security awareness training for new
employees. These policy and training deficiencies significantly increase
the risk of insider threats and human error, which could directly lead
to the compromise of vulnerable systems like the exposed database.</p>
<p>This report details these findings and provides actionable
recommendations to mitigate the identified risks and strengthen the
overall security posture of Silver Leaf Collective.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>

<p>A security questionnaire was completed to evaluate the implementation
of key administrative and technical controls. While the organization
demonstrates strong practices in Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA),
critical gaps were identified in policy and employee training.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-control-gaps">Analysis of Control Gaps</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> The absence
of a formal AUP is a critical governance gap. An AUP defines the rules
and expectations for employee use of company technology and data.
Without it, there is no clear standard for behavior, making it difficult
to enforce security policies or take disciplinary action in case of a
violation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Security Training for New Employees:</strong> New
hires are often a primary target for phishing and social engineering
attacks. Failing to provide security awareness training during the
onboarding process leaves the organization vulnerable from day one of an
employee’s tenure. This gap undermines the effectiveness of the annual
training program.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on the target system
<code>172.16.50.20</code> to identify open ports and exposed services.
The results confirm the presence of an open database port.</p>

<h2 id="technical-analysis">Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>The scan reveals that port <code>3306</code>, the default port for
MySQL databases, is open to the network. The running service was
identified as <strong>MySQL version 5.7.33</strong>. This presents two
major risks:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Service Exposure:</strong> Database services should not
be directly exposed to untrusted networks. An open port allows attackers
to directly interact with the database, enabling brute-force attacks,
credential stuffing, and exploitation of potential
vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Outdated and EOL Software:</strong> MySQL version 5.7
reached its official End-of-Life (EOL) in October 2023. This means it no
longer receives security patches from the vendor. The specific version
detected, 5.7.33, was released in early 2021 and is missing years of
security updates, making it highly susceptible to known
exploits.</p></li>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified
risks. Recommendations are prioritized based on severity and potential
impact.</p>
<h2 id="remediation-for-exposed-outdated-database-critical">Remediation
for Exposed &amp; Outdated Database (Critical)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Action:</strong> Implement strict firewall
rules to block all public access to port <code>3306</code> on host
<code>172.16.50.20</code>. Access should be restricted to only trusted
internal IP addresses that explicitly require it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Short-Term Plan:</strong> Develop a migration plan to
upgrade the MySQL 5.7 database to a currently supported version, such as
MySQL 8.x. This is essential to ensure the service receives ongoing
security patches.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Long-Term Strategy:</strong> For any remote database
administration, implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) with MFA to
ensure all connections are encrypted and authenticated.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="remediation-for-policy-gaps-high">Remediation for Policy Gaps
(High)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Develop an AUP:</strong> Draft and implement a
comprehensive Acceptable Use Policy that covers topics such as data
handling, password security, internet usage, and reporting security
incidents.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Policy Acknowledgement:</strong> Require all current and
new employees to read and formally acknowledge the AUP as a condition of
using company resources.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="remediation-for-training-gaps-high">Remediation for Training
Gaps (High)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Onboarding Training:</strong> Integrate a
mandatory security awareness training module into the new employee
onboarding process. This should cover key topics like phishing, password
hygiene, and the new AUP.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enhance Annual Training:</strong> Review and enhance the
existing annual security training program to ensure it is engaging and
covers current threat trends relevant to the organization.</p></li>
