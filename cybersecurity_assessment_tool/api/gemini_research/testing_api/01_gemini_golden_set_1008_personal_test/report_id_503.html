<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for <strong>Maple Leaf Logistics</strong>, based on the analysis and
correlation of organizational data, network scan results, and
pre-existing risk information. The assessment was conducted to identify
security gaps, technical vulnerabilities, and areas for improvement in
the organization’s overall security framework.</p>
<p>The analysis reveals a mixed security posture. <strong>Maple Leaf
Logistics</strong> has implemented strong foundational controls,
particularly in the mandatory use of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
across key systems. However, two significant risks were identified that
require immediate attention:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Critical Technical Vulnerability:</strong> A network scan
validated a pre-existing critical risk, "Localhost Exposed," on asset
<code>127.0.0.1</code>. An open SSH port (22) on this internal interface
represents a severe misconfiguration that could be leveraged by an
attacker for privilege escalation or unauthorized system
access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>High-Impact Policy Gap:</strong> The organization does
not conduct mandatory annual security awareness training for all
employees. This gap significantly increases the organization’s
susceptibility to social engineering attacks, such as phishing, which
remain a primary vector for security breaches.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This report details these findings and provides actionable
recommendations to mitigate the identified risks and enhance the
organization’s resilience against cyber threats.</p>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A review of the organization’s security controls was conducted based
on a standardized questionnaire. The responses indicate a strong
commitment to identity and access management but highlight a critical
deficiency in ongoing employee security education.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>The "No" response to annual security awareness training is a
significant finding. While training new hires is a crucial first step,
the threat landscape evolves continuously. Without regular, recurring
training, employees are more likely to fall victim to new phishing
techniques and other forms of social engineering, potentially
compromising the very systems protected by MFA.</p>

<p>The scan identified that port 22 (SSH) is open. While SSH is a
standard and secure protocol for remote administration, its presence on
the localhost interface (<code>127.0.0.1</code>) is highly unusual and
often indicative of a misconfiguration. This finding directly validates
the pre-existing risk documented in the following section and elevates
its urgency.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actionable recommendations are provided to address the
identified risks. They are prioritized based on severity and potential
impact.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="r-01-remediate-localhost-exposure-priority-critical">R-01: Remediate
Localhost Exposure (Priority: Critical)</h2>
<p>This vulnerability requires immediate investigation and remediation
due to its critical nature.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Action:</strong> Investigate the purpose of the
SSH service running on the localhost interface of asset
<code>127.0.0.1</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Containment:</strong> If the service is not essential for
a specific application’s function, it should be disabled immediately,
and the configuration should be updated to prevent it from starting on
boot.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hardening:</strong> If the service is required, ensure it
is properly configured. This includes enforcing key-based authentication
only, disabling root login via SSH, and implementing strict firewall
rules to ensure the service cannot be accessed from unintended
sources.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="r-02-implement-annual-security-awareness-training-priority-high">R-02:
Implement Annual Security Awareness Training (Priority: High)</h2>
<p>This policy gap should be closed to strengthen the organization’s
human firewall.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Action:</strong> Procure or develop a
comprehensive security awareness training program. The program should be
mandatory for all employees, including management and executive
staff.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Content:</strong> Training modules should cover modern
threats, including but not limited to: phishing, spear phishing,
business email compromise (BEC), password hygiene, and safe data
handling.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Long-Term Strategy:</strong> Establish a recurring,
annual schedule for this training. Implement a tracking system to
monitor completion rates and ensure 100% compliance. Consider periodic
phishing simulations to test and reinforce the training’s
effectiveness.</p></li>
