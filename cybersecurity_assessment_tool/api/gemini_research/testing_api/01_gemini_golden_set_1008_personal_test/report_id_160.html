<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-overview">1. Executive
Overview</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the cybersecurity
posture for <strong>Nebula Creative</strong>. The assessment is based on
a correlation of organizational data, a security controls questionnaire,
an external network scan, and a review of known risks.</p>
<p>The external network perimeter, as tested against the IP address
<code>69.93.223.194</code>, appears to be well-configured, with no open
ports detected. This significantly reduces the external attack
surface.</p>
<p>However, the internal security control review revealed several
critical gaps. The most severe findings are the complete absence of
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email, computer logins, and
sensitive data systems. Additionally, the lack of mandatory security
awareness training for new employees presents a high risk. These
deficiencies expose the organization to significant threats, including
account compromise, data breaches, and ransomware attacks, despite the
strong network perimeter.</p>
<p>Immediate remediation of these policy and procedural gaps is strongly
recommended to build a defense-in-depth security strategy.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="organizational-information">2. Organizational

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="security-control-review">3. Security Control
Review</h1>
<p>An internal review of security controls was conducted based on a
standardized questionnaire. The results below highlight current
practices. Answers marked with a red ’X’ () indicate a deviation from
security best practices and represent a potential risk.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-gaps">Analysis of Gaps</h2>
<p>The questionnaire reveals critical weaknesses in identity and access
management and employee onboarding. The lack of MFA is a severe
vulnerability, as it means a compromised password is all an attacker
needs to gain access to key systems. The absence of security training
for new hires leaves the organization’s newest and often most vulnerable
employees unprepared to identify and resist social engineering or
phishing attacks.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">4. Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>An external network vulnerability scan was performed to identify open
ports and exposed services on the organization’s public-facing
infrastructure.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong> <code>192.168.1.100</code>
(Internal scan target)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>External IP Address Assessed:</strong>
<code>69.93.223.194</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> 2026-01-31</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="findings">Findings</h2>
<p>The scan results were positive and indicate a strong network
perimeter defense.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports:</strong> None detected.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Port State:</strong> All 1000 scanned ports were reported
as ‘closed‘.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This configuration effectively prevents unsolicited external
connections and is a commendable security practice. No vulnerabilities
related to exposed services were identified.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="consolidated-risk-assessment">5. Consolidated
Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>The following table synthesizes findings from the security control
review, technical scan, and pre-existing risk data. As no pre-existing
vulnerabilities were reported, the risks below are derived directly from
this assessment.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">6. Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and improve the overall security
posture, the following actions are recommended, ordered by priority.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="priority-1-implement-multi-factor-authentication-critical">Priority
1: Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (Critical)</h2>
<p>The highest priority is to deploy MFA across all critical platforms
to protect against account takeover.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Immediately Enforce MFA on Email:</strong> All user
accounts on the <code>NebulaCreative.org</code> email platform (e.g.,
Office 365, Google Workspace) should have MFA enforced without
exception.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Deploy MFA for Remote Access:</strong> Any VPN or other
remote access solution must require MFA.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Protect Sensitive Systems:</strong> Enforce MFA for all
applications and systems that store or process sensitive or confidential
data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Phase-in Endpoint MFA:</strong> Plan a project to require
MFA for all computer and server logins.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="priority-2-enhance-security-awareness-program-high">Priority 2:
Enhance Security Awareness Program (High)</h2>
<p>Strengthen the human firewall by ensuring all employees are equipped
to handle security threats from day one.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Integrate Security Training into Onboarding:</strong>
Develop a mandatory security awareness training module that all new
employees must complete within their first week of employment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Training Content:</strong> This training should cover, at
a minimum: phishing identification, password security policies,
acceptable use of company assets, and the procedure for reporting a
security incident.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="commendation-maintain-network-security">Commendation: Maintain
Network Security</h2>
<p>The organization is commended for its secure external network
configuration. Continue to follow the principle of least privilege by
ensuring that no unnecessary ports are opened to the internet and that
the firewall rules are regularly reviewed and maintained.</p>
