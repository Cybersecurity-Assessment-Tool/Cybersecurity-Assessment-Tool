<h1 id="executive-overview">Executive Overview</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment conducted for <strong>Iron River Finance</strong>. The
assessment incorporated a review of organizational security controls via
a questionnaire, an external network vulnerability scan, and an analysis
of pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The overall security posture presents a mixed landscape. On one hand,
the technical network scan of the target host revealed a strong
perimeter defense, with no open ports detected. This indicates effective
firewall configuration and a minimal network attack surface.</p>
<p>However, the security control review identified several critical and
high-risk gaps in administrative and identity management controls. The
most severe findings are the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) for email and sensitive data systems. These gaps expose the
organization to a significant risk of account takeover, business email
compromise (BEC), and data breaches. Additionally, the lack of a formal
Acceptable Use Policy and mandatory annual security training for all
staff weakens the organization’s human firewall and overall security
culture.</p>
<p>Immediate remediation should focus on implementing MFA across all
critical platforms. Following this, efforts should be directed toward
establishing foundational security policies and a comprehensive,
recurring training program.</p>

<p>A questionnaire was completed to evaluate the implementation of key
administrative and technical security controls. The results are
summarized below. Answers marked with (No) indicate significant gaps in

</table>
<p>The review reveals critical deficiencies in identity and access
management, policy, and ongoing employee education. The lack of MFA on
email and sensitive systems are the most urgent issues requiring
immediate attention.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed to identify open ports and exposed
services on the target system.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> 2026-01-31</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Target Status:</strong> Up</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="summary-of-findings">Summary of Findings</h2>
<p>The scan concluded successfully, and the target host was responsive.
However, <strong>no open ports were discovered</strong>. All 1000
scanned ports were reported as being in a "closed" state.</p>
<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>This is a positive security finding. A host with no open ports
presents a minimal attack surface to the network, significantly reducing
the risk of network-based attacks. This suggests that a firewall (either
network-based or host-based) is properly configured to deny all
unsolicited incoming traffic.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the assessment findings, the following prioritized actions
are recommended to mitigate the identified risks and improve the overall
security posture of <strong>Iron River Finance</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="priority-1-critical">Priority 1: Critical</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email:</strong> Immediately enable and
enforce MFA for all user mailboxes. This is the single most effective
control to prevent unauthorized access to email.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Systems:</strong> Deploy MFA
on all applications and systems that store, process, or transmit
sensitive company or client data. Prioritize systems accessible from the
internet.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="priority-2-high">Priority 2: High</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a formal AUP that clearly defines the rules for
using company IT assets, data, and networks. Require all employees to
read and formally acknowledge the policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish an Annual Security Training Program:</strong>
Institute a mandatory security awareness training program for all
employees to be completed at least once per year. The training should
cover current threats such as phishing, social engineering, and password
security.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="priority-3-informational">Priority 3: Informational</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Maintain Network Security Posture:</strong> Continue the
current practices for network security that resulted in a clean external
scan. Regularly review and test firewall rules to ensure they remain
effective.</p></li>
