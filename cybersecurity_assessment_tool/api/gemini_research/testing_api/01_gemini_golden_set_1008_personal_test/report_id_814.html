<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a cybersecurity posture assessment for
<strong>Brimstone Manufacturing</strong>, conducted on 2026-01-31. The
analysis is based on a review of organizational security controls, a
technical network scan, and a summary of known risks.</p>
<p>The assessment reveals a mixed security posture. The organization has
established a solid foundation with mandatory Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for email access and a comprehensive security
awareness training program. These controls are commendable and
significantly reduce the risk of phishing and social engineering
attacks.</p>
<p>However, critical gaps were identified in access control policies.
The absence of MFA for workstation logins and, most importantly, for
systems containing sensitive data, presents a severe risk. A compromised
user credential could grant an attacker direct access to an employee’s
computer and the organization’s most valuable data assets.</p>
<p>The external network scan of the target IP address
<code>[Target IP]</code> did not identify any open ports. While this may
indicate a strong firewall configuration, it also underscores the
importance of securing internal assets and user credentials, as the
primary risks identified are related to authentication and access
control rather than external exposure.</p>
<p>Immediate remediation should focus on implementing a robust MFA
solution across all workstations and sensitive data systems to mitigate
the risk of unauthorized access.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>An external network vulnerability scan was performed on the
designated target IP address.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not specified in scan data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Summary of Findings:</strong> The scan completed
successfully but did not detect any open TCP or UDP ports on the target
system. This suggests that the host may be protected by a
well-configured firewall that drops or rejects unsolicited incoming
traffic, or the host was not online during the scan. No vulnerabilities
related to exposed services could be identified.</p></li>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes findings from the security control review
and technical scan. The primary risks identified are related to
inadequate access control measures, which could be exploited if an
attacker obtains valid user credentials.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended to
enhance the organization’s security posture. Recommendations are
prioritized by severity.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for All Sensitive Systems
(Critical)</strong><br />
<em>Action:</em> Deploy a mandatory MFA solution for all user accounts
(including administrative and service accounts) that can access systems
containing sensitive financial, customer, or proprietary data. This
control should be the highest priority for remediation.
<em>Justification:</em> This single control provides a powerful defense
against credential theft and is a standard industry best practice for
protecting critical assets.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enforce MFA for Workstation Logins (High)</strong><br />
<em>Action:</em> Require MFA for all local and remote logins to employee
workstations and servers. Solutions like Windows Hello for Business,
Duo, or other third-party integrations can fulfill this requirement.
<em>Justification:</em> This prevents an attacker with a stolen password
from accessing a user’s machine, which is often the entry point for more
sophisticated attacks like ransomware deployment or internal network
reconnaissance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Regular Security Control Audits</strong><br />
<em>Action:</em> Periodically review and audit the implementation of
security controls, including MFA policies, to ensure they are
functioning as intended and covering all new systems and employees.
<em>Justification:</em> Continuous verification ensures that security
policies remain effective over time and adapt to changes in the IT
environment.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p><strong>Brimstone Manufacturing</strong> has successfully implemented
important foundational security controls, particularly regarding email
security and employee awareness. However, the current reliance on
passwords as the sole authentication factor for workstations and
sensitive systems creates an unacceptable level of risk.</p>
<p>By addressing the critical and high-priority recommendations outlined
in this report, the organization can significantly strengthen its
defenses against common cyber threats and protect its valuable data
assets from unauthorized access.</p>
