<p><strong>Cybersecurity Posture Report</strong></p>

<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity assessment for
<strong>Opal Sky Media</strong>, synthesizing information from
organizational questionnaires, external network scans, and a review of
pre-existing risks. The analysis reveals a mixed security posture with
significant strengths in policy but critical deficiencies in technical
and procedural controls.</p>
<p>The external network scan of the target IP address revealed no open
ports, suggesting a strong network perimeter defense or a
well-configured firewall. This is a positive security finding.</p>
<p>However, the organizational data highlights several critical-risk
gaps. The most pressing concern is the complete absence of Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for accessing email, computers, and sensitive data
systems. This exposes the organization to a high risk of account
compromise and unauthorized access. Additionally, the lack of mandatory
security awareness training for new employees creates an immediate
vulnerability, as new hires may be unaware of company policies and
common cyber threats.</p>
<p>Immediate remediation should focus on implementing a robust MFA
solution across all critical assets and integrating security training
into the employee onboarding process.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following details were provided for the assessment. This
information forms the basis of the organizational context for the
technical and procedural analysis.</p>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A review of the organization’s security controls was conducted via a
questionnaire. The responses indicate the current state of procedural
and policy-based defenses. "No" answers represent significant gaps that
increase organizational risk.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-control-gaps">Analysis of Control
Gaps</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> The
absence of MFA for email, computer logins, and sensitive systems is a
<strong>Critical Risk</strong>. Stolen or weak passwords are a primary
vector for attackers, and MFA is the single most effective control to
mitigate this threat.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Onboarding Security Training:</strong> Failing to
train new employees on security best practices and company policies from
day one is a <strong>High Risk</strong>. New hires are often targeted by
social engineering attacks and may inadvertently cause security
incidents.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed to identify exposed services
and potential vulnerabilities on the organization’s public-facing
infrastructure.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> 2026-01-31</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="findings">Findings</h2>
<p>The scan completed successfully but did not identify any open TCP or
UDP ports on the target system. This indicates that the host is likely
protected by a well-configured firewall that is effectively blocking
unsolicited inbound traffic. This is a strong positive indicator of a
hardened network perimeter. No vulnerabilities were identified.</p>
<h1 id="consolidated-risk-assessment">Consolidated Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes findings from the security control review,
technical scans, and pre-existing risk data. Based on the provided
inputs, no pre-existing vulnerabilities were reported. The primary risks
identified are procedural and originate from the control gaps.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified
risks and improve the overall security posture of <strong>Opal Sky
Media</strong>.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="immediate-actions-0-30-days">Immediate
Actions (0-30 Days)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA on Critical Systems (Risk:
Critical):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Enable and enforce MFA for all users on
the primary email system (e.g., Office 365, Google Workspace).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> This is the most effective step
to prevent unauthorized access to email, which is a gateway to other
sensitive systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> Urgent.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop an Onboarding Security Module (Risk:
High):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Create a mandatory security awareness
training module to be completed by all new employees within their first
week of employment. This should cover the acceptable use policy,
phishing identification, and password security.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> This ensures a baseline security
understanding for all new personnel, reducing the risk of early-tenure
security incidents.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> High.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="strategic-actions-30-90-days">Strategic
Actions (30-90 Days)</h2>
<ol start="3">
<li><p><strong>Expand MFA Coverage (Risk: Critical):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Roll out MFA requirements for all remote
access solutions (VPN), privileged accounts, and systems containing
sensitive or regulated data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> Extends protection beyond email
to secure the entire data ecosystem and administrative access
points.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> High.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p><strong>Opal Sky Media</strong> has established a strong network
perimeter, as evidenced by the clean external scan. However, significant
internal and procedural weaknesses present a clear and present danger to
the organization. The absence of Multi-Factor Authentication is a
critical vulnerability that must be addressed with the utmost
urgency.</p>
<p>By implementing the recommendations outlined in this report,
particularly the rapid deployment of MFA and the formalization of
security training for new hires, the organization can substantially
reduce its risk exposure and build a more resilient security
posture.</p>
