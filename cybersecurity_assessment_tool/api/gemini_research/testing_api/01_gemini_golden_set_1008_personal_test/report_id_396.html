<p><strong>Cybersecurity Posture Assessment Report</strong></p>

Report ID: CPA-2023-4815</p>
<p><em>This report contains sensitive information and is intended solely

</div>
<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a cybersecurity posture assessment for Neon
Pulse Entertainment, based on an analysis of organizational security
controls provided via a questionnaire. It is critical to note that the
technical network scan data (<code>Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON</code>) and
the pre-existing risk data (<code>Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON</code>)
were found to be corrupted and could not be processed. Consequently,
this assessment focuses primarily on procedural and policy-based
controls.</p>
<p>The analysis revealed several critical security gaps that place the
organization at a high risk of compromise. The most significant finding
is the complete absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all
key systems, including email, computer logins, and access to sensitive
data. This lack of a fundamental security control exposes the
organization to severe threats, including business email compromise,
ransomware, and data breaches originating from stolen credentials.</p>
<p>Additionally, a high-risk gap was identified in the employee
onboarding process, where new hires do not receive security awareness
training. This leaves a window of vulnerability where new staff are more
susceptible to social engineering and phishing attacks.</p>
<p>Immediate remediation of these issues is strongly recommended to
reduce the organization’s attack surface and mitigate the risk of a
significant security incident.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>The input data file containing the results of the network scan
(<code>Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON</code>) was corrupted and could not be
parsed. Therefore, no technical analysis of open ports, running
services, or potential software vulnerabilities could be performed on
the target IP address (<code>123.88.20.7</code>).</p>
<p>A comprehensive, authenticated vulnerability scan of the
organization’s external and internal infrastructure is highly
recommended to identify and remediate technical vulnerabilities that
currently remain unknown. Without this data, the organization has a
significant blind spot regarding its technical security posture.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Similar to the technical scan data, the input file containing a list
of current, known risks (<code>Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON</code>) was
also found to be corrupted. The risks listed below have been newly
identified based on the analysis of the security control
questionnaire.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the findings of this assessment, the following prioritized
actions are recommended to strengthen the security posture of Neon Pulse
Entertainment.</p>
<h2
id="priority-1-implement-multi-factor-authentication-critical">Priority
1: Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (Critical)</h2>
<p>The highest priority is to mitigate the risk of account
compromise.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action 1.1:</strong> Immediately enforce MFA for all user
accounts on the primary email system (e.g., Microsoft 365, Google
Workspace).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action 1.2:</strong> Deploy an MFA solution for all
employee computer logins (both local and remote access).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action 1.3:</strong> Mandate MFA for all applications and
systems that store or process sensitive company or customer
data.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="priority-2-enhance-security-awareness-program-high">Priority 2:
Enhance Security Awareness Program (High)</h2>
<p>Address the gap in the employee lifecycle to build a stronger human
firewall.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action 2.1:</strong> Develop and integrate a mandatory
security awareness training module into the new-hire onboarding process.
This training should be completed before a new employee is granted full
access to corporate systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action 2.2:</strong> This training should cover key
topics such as phishing identification, acceptable use policies, and
password hygiene.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2
id="priority-3-conduct-a-comprehensive-technical-assessment-medium">Priority
3: Conduct a Comprehensive Technical Assessment (Medium)</h2>
<p>Gain visibility into the technical attack surface that was missed due
to the corrupted input data.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action 3.1:</strong> Commission a full, external network
vulnerability scan and penetration test against the public-facing IP
address <code>123.88.20.7</code> and associated web domains.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action 3.2:</strong> Perform an internal vulnerability
scan to identify unpatched systems, misconfigurations, and other
weaknesses within the corporate network.</p></li>
