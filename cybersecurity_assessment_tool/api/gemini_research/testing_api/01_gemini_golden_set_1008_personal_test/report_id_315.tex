% --- 1. Executive Summary ---
\section*{1. Executive Summary}

This report details the findings of a cybersecurity assessment conducted for \textbf{True North Travel}. The analysis is based on a network vulnerability scan, a review of organizational security controls, and an evaluation of pre-existing risks.

The assessment identified a \severitycritical{} risk: a publicly accessible MySQL database server (\texttt{172.16.50.20}) running an outdated and End-of-Life (EOL) version (MySQL 5.7.33). This exposes the organization to significant threats, including data breach, ransomware, and service disruption.

Furthermore, critical gaps in security policies were identified. The lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA) for sensitive data systems and the absence of security awareness training for new employees represent \severityhigh{} organizational risks. These policy gaps directly increase the likelihood of a successful cyberattack against the technically vulnerable systems.

Immediate remediation is required to address the exposed database. Strategic improvements to security policies are necessary to build a more resilient and secure operational environment.

% --- 2. Organizational Information ---
\section*{2. Organizational Information}

The following information was provided for the assessment.

\begin{tabular}{@{}ll}
    \toprule
    \textbf{Attribute} & \textbf{Value} \\
    \midrule
    Organization Name & \textbf{True North Travel} \\
    Email Domain & \texttt{TrueNorthTravel.com} \\
    Website Domain & \texttt{www.TrueNorthTravel.com} \\
    External IP Address & \texttt{141.193.210.218} \\
    \bottomrule
\end{tabular}

% --- 3. Security Control Review ---
\section*{3. Security Control Review}

A review of internal security controls was conducted via a standardized questionnaire. The responses highlight critical areas for improvement in the organization's security posture.

\subsection*{3.1 Questionnaire Responses}

\begin{tabular}{p{0.75\linewidth} c}
    \toprule
    \textbf{Control Question} & \textbf{Response} \\
    \midrule
    Do you require MFA to access email? & \yes \\
    Do you require MFA to log into computers? & \yes \\
    Do you require MFA to access sensitive data systems? & \no \\
    Does your organization have an employee acceptable use policy? & \yes \\
    Does your organization do security awareness training for new employees? & \no \\
    Does your organization do security awareness training for all employees at least once per year? & \yes \\
    \bottomrule
\end{tabular}

\subsection*{3.2 Analysis of Control Gaps}

Two "No" answers indicate significant control deficiencies:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{No MFA for Sensitive Systems:} This is a critical weakness. Sensitive systems, especially databases, are high-value targets for attackers. The absence of MFA removes a crucial layer of defense, making them vulnerable to compromise via stolen credentials.
    \item \textbf{No Security Training for New Employees:} New hires are often targeted by social engineering and phishing attacks. Failing to provide security training during onboarding leaves the organization vulnerable and perpetuates a weak security culture.
\end{itemize}

% --- 4. Technical Scan Results ---
\section*{4. Technical Scan Results}

An external network scan was performed to identify open ports and exposed services on the target system.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Target IP:} \texttt{172.16.50.20}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{4.1 Open Ports Discovered}

\begin{tabular}{@{}lllll}
    \toprule
    \textbf{Port} & \textbf{State} & \textbf{Service} & \textbf{Product} & \textbf{Version} \\
    \midrule
    3306/tcp & open & mysql & MySQL & 5.7.33 \\
    \bottomrule
\end{tabular}

\subsection*{4.2 Technical Analysis}

The scan revealed that port \textbf{3306}, the default port for MySQL databases, is open to the network. This directly confirms the "Database Exposure" risk.

More critically, the detected version, \textbf{MySQL 5.7.33}, is part of the MySQL 5.7 series which reached its official \textbf{End-of-Life (EOL) in October 2023}. EOL software no longer receives security updates, patches, or support from the vendor. Any vulnerabilities discovered after this date will remain unpatched, making the system an easy and attractive target for attackers.

% --- 5. Consolidated Risk Assessment ---
\section*{5. Consolidated Risk Assessment}

The following table synthesizes findings from the security control review, technical scan, and pre-existing risk data into a prioritized list of current risks.

\begin{tabular}{@{}p{0.25\linewidth} p{0.15\linewidth} p{0.5\linewidth}}
    \toprule
    \textbf{Risk Name} & \textbf{Severity} & \textbf{Details \& Business Impact} \\
    \midrule
    \textbf{Exposed End-of-Life Database} & \severitycritical{} & The MySQL database on port 3306 is publicly accessible and runs an unsupported, unpatched version (5.7.33). This presents an immediate and severe risk of data breach, data corruption, or ransomware infection. \\
    \addlinespace
    \textbf{Lack of MFA on Sensitive Systems} & \severityhigh{} & The absence of MFA on critical systems, including the exposed database, means a single compromised password could lead to a full system compromise. This significantly increases the likelihood of unauthorized access. \\
    \addlinespace
    \textbf{Inadequate Employee Onboarding Security} & \severitymedium{} & New employees are not receiving security awareness training. This makes them susceptible to phishing and social engineering attacks, which are common initial vectors for network intrusion. \\
    \bottomrule
\end{tabular}

% --- 6. Recommendations ---
\section*{6. Recommendations}

The following actionable recommendations are provided in order of priority to mitigate the identified risks.

\subsection*{Priority 1: Immediate Actions (To be completed within 72 hours)}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Restrict Database Access:} Immediately implement firewall rules to block all public access to TCP port 3306 on host \texttt{172.16.50.20}. Access should be restricted to a whitelist of trusted internal IP addresses only. This is the most critical step to mitigate the exposure risk.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Priority 2: High-Priority Actions (To be completed within 30 days)}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Plan and Execute Database Upgrade:} Initiate a project to upgrade the MySQL 5.7 database to a currently supported version (e.g., MySQL 8.x). This is essential to ensure the system receives ongoing security patches.
    \item \textbf{Enforce MFA on All Sensitive Systems:} Procure and deploy an MFA solution for all sensitive data systems, with the database administration interface being the top priority. This directly addresses the critical control gap.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Priority 3: Medium-Priority Actions (To be completed within 90 days)}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Integrate Security into Onboarding:} Develop and mandate a security awareness training module for all new employees as a standard part of the onboarding process. This training should cover phishing, password hygiene, and the acceptable use policy.
\end{enumerate}
