<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-overview">Executive Overview</h1>
<p>This report provides a summary of the cybersecurity posture for
<strong>Aetheric Systems</strong>, based on a combination of a technical
network scan, a security controls questionnaire, and a review of
pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The assessment revealed a mixed security posture. On a positive note,
the technical scan of the target host <code>192.168.1.100</code>
indicated a strong network security configuration, with no open ports
detected. This suggests a well-configured firewall or a system with no
exposed network services, significantly reducing its external attack
surface.</p>
<p>However, the security controls review identified two high-risk
procedural gaps. The absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on
email accounts presents a critical vulnerability, exposing the
organization to significant risks such as Business Email Compromise
(BEC) and unauthorized data access. Additionally, the lack of security
awareness training for new employees creates an immediate risk, as new
hires may be unaware of security policies and more susceptible to social
engineering attacks.</p>
<p>Immediate remediation should focus on closing these procedural gaps
to mitigate the most significant threats to the organization.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on the specified target to identify its
external posture.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Summary:</strong> The scan confirmed that the host
is online. However, no open ports were detected. All other scanned ports
were reported as ’closed’.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Analysis:</strong> This is a positive security finding.
It indicates a strong firewall configuration or a lack of network-facing
services on this host, which effectively minimizes its network-based
attack surface.</p></li>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified
risks and improve the overall security posture of <strong>Aetheric
Systems</strong>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>High Priority - Remediate RISK-001:</dt>
<dd>
<p>Implement and enforce mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
all user access to the corporate email system. Solutions like
authenticator apps (e.g., Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator)
or hardware tokens should be deployed immediately to protect against
account takeovers.</p>
</dd>
<dt>High Priority - Remediate RISK-002:</dt>
<dd>
<p>Develop and implement a mandatory security awareness training module
as part of the new employee onboarding process. This training should
cover, at a minimum, phishing identification, acceptable use policies,
password hygiene, and procedures for reporting security incidents.</p>
</dd>
<dt>General Recommendation:</dt>
<dd>
<p>Continue to maintain the strong network security posture observed on
the scanned host. We recommend performing regular, authenticated
vulnerability scans on internal assets and periodic external scans to
ensure configurations remain secure and to identify any new
weaknesses.</p>
