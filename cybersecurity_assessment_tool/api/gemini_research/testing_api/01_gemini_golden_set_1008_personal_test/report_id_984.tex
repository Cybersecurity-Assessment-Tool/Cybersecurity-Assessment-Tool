% --- 1. Executive Summary ---
\section{Executive Summary}

This report provides a cybersecurity posture assessment for \textbf{Apex Legends Group}. The analysis is based on a review of organizational security controls provided via a questionnaire. 

\textbf{Important Note:} The technical network scan data (Input 1) and the list of pre-existing vulnerabilities (Input 3) were found to be corrupted and could not be analyzed. Therefore, this assessment is limited to the procedural and policy-based controls self-reported by the organization.

The primary findings indicate several \textbf{critical security gaps}. The complete absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all key systems, including email, endpoints, and sensitive data repositories, presents a severe and immediate risk of account compromise and unauthorized access. 

Furthermore, significant weaknesses were identified in the organization's security policies and training programs. The lack of a formal Acceptable Use Policy and the failure to provide annual security awareness training for all employees create an environment where risky behavior is more likely to occur and go unaddressed.

Immediate remediation of these issues is strongly recommended to reduce the organization's attack surface and mitigate the high likelihood of a security incident. A follow-up technical assessment is required once the network scan issues are resolved.

\section{Organizational Information}

The following details were provided by the client and used as the basis for this assessment.

\begin{tabular}{@{}ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Attribute} & \textbf{Value} \\
\midrule
Organization Name & \textbf{Apex Legends Group} \\
Email Domain      & \texttt{ApexLegendsGroup.net} \\
Website Domain    & \url{www.ApexLegendsGroup.net} \\
External IP Address & \texttt{228.119.178.97} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}

% --- 3. Security Control Review ---
\section{Security Control Review}

The following table details the responses from the security questionnaire. A green checkmark (\textcolor{green}{\ding{51}}) indicates a positive security control, while a red cross (\textcolor{red}{\ding{55}}) indicates a significant gap that increases risk.

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{}p{0.6\linewidth} c p{0.2\linewidth}@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Control Question} & \textbf{Response} & \textbf{Assessment} \\
\midrule
Does your organization do security awareness training for new employees? & \textcolor{green}{\ding{51}} & Positive Control \\
\midrule
Do you require MFA to access email? & \textcolor{red}{\ding{55}} & \textbf{Critical Gap} \\
\midrule
Do you require MFA to log into computers? & \textcolor{red}{\ding{55}} & \textbf{High Risk} \\
\midrule
Do you require MFA to access sensitive data systems? & \textcolor{red}{\ding{55}} & \textbf{Critical Gap} \\
\midrule
Does your organization have an employee acceptable use policy? & \textcolor{red}{\ding{55}} & \textbf{High Risk} \\
\midrule
Does your organization do security awareness training for all employees at least once per year? & \textcolor{red}{\ding{55}} & \textbf{High Risk} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Organizational Security Control Status}
\end{table}

The review reveals a systemic failure to implement fundamental access control measures (MFA) and formalize security policies, which are foundational elements of a robust cybersecurity program.

% --- 4. Technical Scan Results ---
\section{Technical Scan Results}

The external network scan data provided for this assessment was corrupted and could not be parsed. As a result, no analysis of open ports, running services, or potential software vulnerabilities on the external IP address (\texttt{228.119.178.97}) could be performed.

\textbf{Finding:} The inability to retrieve valid scan data is a significant operational issue. Without this visibility, the organization is blind to potential vulnerabilities on its internet-facing infrastructure.

\textbf{Recommendation:} A new, successful network scan must be conducted as a matter of priority to complete the technical portion of this assessment. The root cause of the data corruption should be investigated to ensure the reliability of security scanning tools.

% --- 5. Risk Assessment Summary ---
\section{Risk Assessment Summary}

Based on the available data from the security questionnaire, the following risks have been identified. The pre-existing risk data was unavailable for correlation.

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{}p{0.3\linewidth} p{0.15\linewidth} p{0.45\linewidth}@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Risk Name} & \textbf{Severity} & \textbf{Overview} \\
\midrule
\textbf{Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)} & \textcolor{critical}{\textbf{Critical}} & The absence of MFA for email, endpoints, and sensitive data exposes the organization to a high risk of credential theft, phishing, and unauthorized access to critical systems. \\
\addlinespace
\textbf{Inadequate Security Training Program} & \textcolor{high}{\textbf{High}} & Training only new hires and not providing annual refreshers for all staff leads to knowledge decay. Employees are less likely to recognize and report modern phishing and social engineering attacks. \\
\addlinespace
\textbf{Missing Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)} & \textcolor{high}{\textbf{High}} & Without a formal AUP, there are no clear guidelines for employees on the safe and acceptable use of company assets. This increases the risk of insider threat, data leakage, and malware infection. \\

% --- 6. Recommendations ---
\section{Recommendations}

The following actionable steps are recommended to mitigate the identified risks. They are prioritized based on severity and potential impact.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{[Critical] Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Priority 1:} Immediately enable MFA on the organization's email platform (\texttt{ApexLegendsGroup.net}). This is the single most effective control to prevent business email compromise.
        \item \textbf{Priority 2:} Enforce MFA for all remote access solutions (e.g., VPN) and access to systems containing sensitive data.
        \item \textbf{Priority 3:} Roll out MFA for all employee computer logins.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{[High] Establish a Comprehensive Security Awareness Program:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Develop or procure a security awareness training module that covers key topics like phishing, password security, and data handling.
        \item Mandate that all employees complete this training annually. Track completion to ensure compliance.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{[High] Develop and Enforce an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Draft a formal AUP that clearly defines the rules for using company networks, computers, and data.
        \item Require all employees to read and formally acknowledge the policy as a condition of their access.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{[Procedural] Remediate Security Visibility Gaps:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Conduct a new external network scan against \texttt{228.119.178.97} to identify technical vulnerabilities.
        \item Investigate and resolve the cause of the corrupted scan and risk data to ensure future assessments are based on complete information.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

% --- 7. Conclusion ---
\section{Conclusion}

While \textbf{Apex Legends Group} has initiated a security program by providing training to new hires, there are critical deficiencies that require immediate attention. The lack of fundamental controls like Multi-Factor Authentication and a comprehensive policy framework places the organization at significant risk. 

By implementing the prioritized recommendations in this report, the organization can substantially improve its security posture, build resilience against common cyber threats, and create a stronger foundation for its security program. A full technical review is pending the successful completion of a network scan.
