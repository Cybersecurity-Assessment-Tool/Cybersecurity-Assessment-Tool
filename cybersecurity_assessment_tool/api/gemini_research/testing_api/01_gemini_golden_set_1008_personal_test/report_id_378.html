<h1 id="executive-overview">Executive Overview</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment for <strong>Harbor Light Foundation</strong>. The analysis is
based on a combination of network scanning, a review of organizational
security controls, and an evaluation of pre-existing risk data.</p>
<p>The assessment reveals a mixed security posture. On a positive note,
a previously identified risk concerning an unencrypted web server on
port 80 appears to have been remediated, as the corresponding port was
found to be closed during our technical scan.</p>
<p>However, significant and critical gaps were identified in the
organization’s access control and employee security policies. The
absence of multi-factor authentication (MFA) for computer and sensitive
data system access represents a high risk of unauthorized access.
Furthermore, the lack of a formal Acceptable Use Policy and mandatory
security training for new employees creates vulnerabilities related to
insider threats and human error.</p>
<p>Immediate action is required to address these policy and access
control deficiencies to mitigate substantial risks to the organization’s
data and systems.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A review of the organization’s security controls was conducted via a
questionnaire. The responses highlight critical areas requiring
immediate attention. A checkmark () indicates a positive control is in
place, while a cross () indicates a control gap.</p>

Gaps</h2>
<p>The lack of MFA on employee computers and sensitive data systems is a
<strong>High Risk</strong>. This significantly increases the likelihood
of a successful breach if an employee’s credentials are compromised. The
absence of an Acceptable Use Policy and security training for new hires
are <strong>Critical Gaps</strong> that expose the organization to
unmitigated risks from insider threats and accidental data exposure.</p>

<p>The scan indicates that the target host is online, but no open ports
were discovered. Notably, Port 80 (HTTP), which was identified as a risk
in previous assessments (<em>Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON</em>), was found
to be <strong>closed</strong>. This is a positive security development,
suggesting the risk of an unencrypted web server has been successfully
mitigated. No other vulnerabilities were identified from this scan.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the consolidated risk assessment, the following actions are
recommended to improve the security posture of <strong>Harbor Light
Foundation</strong>.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="high-priority">High Priority</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA Across All Systems:</strong> Immediately
deploy a mandatory MFA policy for logging into all employee computers
and for accessing any systems containing sensitive or critical data.
This is the single most effective control to mitigate credential
theft.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a formal AUP that all employees must read and
sign. This policy should clearly define the rules for using company
networks, devices, and data.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="medium-priority">Medium Priority</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Integrate Security Training into Onboarding:</strong>
Develop a security awareness training module and make it a mandatory
part of the onboarding process for all new employees before they are
granted system access.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="verification">Verification</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Confirm Port 80 Closure:</strong> While the scan shows
Port 80 is closed, it is recommended to formally verify with the IT team
that this was an intentional change and that the underlying service is
no longer required. Document this change for future reference.</p></li>
