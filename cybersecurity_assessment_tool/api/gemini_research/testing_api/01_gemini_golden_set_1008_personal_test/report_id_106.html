<p><strong>Cybersecurity Posture Assessment Report</strong></p>
<p>Prepared for:<br />
<strong>Common Ground</strong></p>
<p>2026-01-31</p>
</div>
<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a cybersecurity posture assessment for
<strong>Common Ground</strong>, based on a review of organizational
security controls, an external network scan, and an analysis of
pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The assessment reveals a mixed security posture. The organization has
implemented foundational controls, such as requiring Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for email and computer access, and providing
security training for new hires. These are commendable baseline
practices.</p>
<p>However, two significant gaps were identified that present a high
level of risk to the organization:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Systems:</strong> The absence
of mandatory MFA for accessing sensitive data systems is a critical
vulnerability. This exposes the organization’s most valuable data to
compromise, should an attacker gain access to employee
credentials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Annual Security Training:</strong> Security awareness
is not reinforced annually for all employees. This increases the
organization’s susceptibility to social engineering attacks like
phishing, as employee knowledge degrades over time.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The external network scan of the designated target IP address did not
identify any open ports or exposed services. This is a positive finding,
suggesting a well-configured perimeter firewall or that the host was not
responsive at the time of the scan. No pre-existing vulnerabilities were
provided for review.</p>
<p>Recommendations focus on immediately addressing the identified
critical and high-risk gaps to significantly improve the organization’s
defense against common cyber threats.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network vulnerability scan was performed to identify
exposed services and potential vulnerabilities on the organization’s
perimeter.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> 2026-01-31</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="findings">Findings</h2>
<p>The scan completed successfully but did not discover any open TCP or
UDP ports on the target host.</p>
<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>This result indicates that the target system is not exposing any
common network services to the internet. This is a positive security
finding and typically suggests one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The perimeter firewall is correctly configured to block all
unsolicited inbound traffic (“default deny”).</p></li>
<li><p>The target host was offline or otherwise unresponsive during the
scan window.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>No vulnerabilities were identified from this external scan.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified
risks and strengthen the overall security posture of <strong>Common
Ground</strong>. Recommendations are prioritized based on severity.</p>
<h2
id="priority-1-implement-mfa-for-sensitive-systems-risk-001">Priority 1:
Implement MFA for Sensitive Systems (RISK-001)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Enforce mandatory Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) across all applications, databases, and
administrative interfaces that store, process, or transmit sensitive
data. This includes financial systems, customer databases, and core
infrastructure management consoles.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> MFA is one of the most effective
controls for preventing unauthorized access. It ensures that even if an
attacker steals a password, they cannot access the protected system
without the second factor (e.g., a code from a mobile app or a hardware
key). This directly mitigates the risk of a data breach resulting from
credential compromise.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2
id="priority-2-establish-annual-security-awareness-training-risk-002">Priority
2: Establish Annual Security Awareness Training (RISK-002)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop and implement a mandatory
security awareness training program for all employees, to be completed
annually. The training should cover current threats such as phishing,
ransomware, proper data handling, and password security. Consider
including periodic phishing simulations to test and reinforce the
training.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> Humans are a critical part of an
organization’s defense. Regular training ensures that security remains a
top-of-mind concern and equips employees to recognize and report threats
effectively, significantly reducing the likelihood of a security
incident caused by human error.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2
id="priority-3-implement-a-risk-management-program-risk-003">Priority 3:
Implement a Risk Management Program (RISK-003)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Establish a formal process for
identifying, assessing, and tracking security risks. This includes
maintaining a risk register that documents known vulnerabilities, their
potential impact, and the status of mitigation efforts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> A structured risk management
program provides leadership with the visibility needed to make informed
decisions about security investments and priorities. It ensures that
vulnerabilities are not overlooked and are addressed in a timely
manner.</p></li>
