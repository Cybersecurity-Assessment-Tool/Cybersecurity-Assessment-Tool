<p><strong>Cybersecurity Assessment Report</strong></p>

<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity assessment
conducted for Cinder &amp; Ash. The assessment combined a review of
organizational security controls via a questionnaire with a targeted
technical network scan to provide a holistic view of the current
security posture.</p>
<p>The assessment identified a significant disparity between the
organization’s technical and procedural security controls. The technical
scan of the target host () revealed a strong network security posture,
with no open ports detected. This indicates effective firewalling and a
minimal attack surface for that specific asset.</p>
<p>However, the review of organizational controls uncovered several
critical and high-risk gaps. The most severe finding is the lack of
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access, which exposes the
organization to a high risk of Business Email Compromise (BEC),
phishing, and account takeovers. Additional high-risk findings include
the absence of an employee Acceptable Use Policy and a lack of security
awareness training for new hires upon joining.</p>
<p>While no pre-existing vulnerabilities were documented and the
technical scan was clean, these policy and procedural gaps represent the
most significant threats to the organization. We strongly recommend
prioritizing the remediation of these findings, starting with the
immediate implementation of MFA for all email accounts.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network port scan was performed on the specified target system to
identify potentially vulnerable services.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Summary:</strong> The scan reported the host as
"up", but found no open TCP ports. All 1000 scanned ports were in a
"closed" state.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="interpretation">Interpretation</h2>
<p>The results indicate a very strong network security posture for the
scanned host. The absence of open ports significantly reduces the
network attack surface, suggesting that the system is either not hosting
network services or is protected by a well-configured host-based or
network firewall. No network-based vulnerabilities were identified on
this system during the scan.</p>
<h1 id="overall-risk-assessment">Overall Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes findings from the security control review
and technical scan. While no pre-existing risks were documented and no
technical vulnerabilities were found, the procedural gaps represent a
significant threat. The following new risks have been identified:</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the findings of this assessment, we provide the following
actionable recommendations to mitigate the identified risks and improve
the overall security posture of Cinder &amp; Ash.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>[Critical] Implement MFA for Email Access:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediately enable and enforce
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all user and administrative email
accounts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> This is the single most effective
control to prevent unauthorized account access resulting from credential
theft or phishing. It directly mitigates the risk of Business Email
Compromise (BEC). This should be the highest priority remediation
activity.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>[High] Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Create a formal AUP document that
clearly defines the rules and expectations for the use of company
networks, systems, and data. This policy should be distributed to all
employees, who must formally acknowledge their understanding and
agreement.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> An AUP establishes a baseline for
secure user behavior, reduces insider threats (both malicious and
accidental), and provides a framework for enforcing security
standards.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>[High] Integrate Security Training into Employee
Onboarding:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop a security awareness training
module specifically for new hires and make it a mandatory part of the
onboarding process. This training should occur within the first week of
employment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> New employees are often more
susceptible to social engineering attacks. Immediate training closes the
significant gap between their start date and the annual security
training, reducing early-stage vulnerabilities.</p></li>
</ul></li>
