<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a cybersecurity posture assessment for
<strong>Astraeus Aerospace</strong>, conducted on 2026-01-31. The
analysis is based on a review of organizational security controls, an
external network scan, and a summary of pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The overall security posture of the organization shows a strong
foundation in policy and user awareness. Controls such as Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive systems are commendable.
However, a <strong>critical control gap</strong> was identified: the
absence of mandatory MFA for logging into employee computers. This
represents a significant risk, as compromised user credentials could
lead directly to endpoint and internal network access.</p>
<p>The external network scan performed against the target IP address did
not identify any open ports. This is a positive finding, suggesting a
well-configured perimeter firewall that properly implements the
principle of least privilege by denying all unsolicited inbound traffic.
No pre-existing vulnerabilities were reported for assessment.</p>
<p>Our primary recommendation is the immediate implementation of an MFA
solution for all endpoint logins to mitigate the risk of unauthorized
access.</p>

<p>A review of self-reported security controls was conducted based on a
standardized questionnaire. The results highlight the organization’s
current policies and identify potential areas for improvement. A ()
indicates a positive control is in place, while a () indicates a control
gap.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>The organization has implemented several key security controls
effectively, particularly concerning MFA for critical systems and a
robust security awareness program. However, the lack of MFA for computer
logins is a significant weakness. If an employee’s credentials are
stolen (e.g., through a phishing attack), an attacker could gain direct
access to their workstation and, consequently, the internal network.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network vulnerability scan was conducted against the
provided IP address.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP:</strong> <code>[Target IP]</code> (Note:
Target IP was not specified in the scan data; the organizational IP is
assumed to be the intended target).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not provided in scan data.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="findings">Findings</h2>
<p>The scan results were empty, indicating that <strong>no open ports or
services were discovered</strong> on the target host. This is a positive
security finding. It suggests that the perimeter firewall is effectively
configured to block all unsolicited incoming connections, which
significantly reduces the external attack surface. This could also
indicate the host was offline or configured not to respond to scan
probes.</p>

review and technical scan to provide a consolidated list of identified

shifts from external exploitation to attacks originating from
compromised endpoints.</td>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are provided to
enhance the cybersecurity posture of <strong>Astraeus
Aerospace</strong>.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="priority-1-critical">Priority 1:
Critical</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for All Endpoint Logins:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Deploy a mandatory Multi-Factor
Authentication solution for all employee computer and laptop logins
(Windows, macOS, Linux).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> This is the most critical action
to take. It closes the security gap identified in the control review and
provides a vital layer of defense against credential theft and
unauthorized access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Examples:</strong> Solutions include Windows Hello for
Business, Duo Security, Okta, or other FIDO2-compliant hardware
keys.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="priority-2-high">Priority 2: High</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>No high-priority recommendations were identified beyond the
critical need for endpoint MFA.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="priority-3-medium">Priority 3: Medium</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Regular Vulnerability Scanning:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Establish a formal program for regular,
authenticated internal and external vulnerability scanning.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> While the external posture
appears strong, continuous scanning ensures that new vulnerabilities or
misconfigurations are identified and remediated promptly. Authenticated
internal scans are necessary to identify weaknesses that are not visible
from the outside.</p></li>
