<h1 id="executive-overview">Executive Overview</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity assessment
conducted for Gilded Cage Design. The assessment combined a review of
organizational security controls, an external network scan, and an
analysis of pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The overall security posture is assessed as
<strong>High-Risk</strong>. Several critical gaps in fundamental
security controls were identified. The most significant risks stem from
the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on employee computers and
sensitive data systems. This is compounded by the absence of a formal
security awareness training program, which significantly increases the
organization’s susceptibility to social engineering and phishing
attacks.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a technical scan revealed an exposed Secure Shell (SSH)
service on an IPv6 address. While a common administrative port, its
exposure to the public internet without robust controls presents a
direct vector for unauthorized access.</p>
<p>Immediate and decisive action is required to address these
deficiencies. Recommendations in this report are prioritized to guide
remediation efforts, focusing first on mitigating the most critical
risks to the organization’s data and operations.</p>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A review of administrative and organizational security controls was
conducted based on a standardized questionnaire. The responses indicate
critical gaps in identity and access management and employee security
training. "No" answers represent a failure to meet baseline security
best practices and are a primary source of organizational risk.</p>

<p>An external network scan was performed to identify exposed services.

<h2 id="technical-analysis">Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>The presence of an open SSH port (22) indicates that a system is
configured for remote administrative access from the internet. This is a
common attack vector. Without robust controls such as IP address
whitelisting, key-based authentication, and diligent patching, this
service can be exploited by brute-force attacks or by leveraging stolen
credentials. The risk associated with this finding is significantly
elevated by the organizational control gaps identified in Section 3.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>

review and the technical scan. The following risks have been identified

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and improve the overall security
posture, the following actions are recommended. They are prioritized to
address the most critical vulnerabilities first.</p>
<h2 id="immediate-priority-critical">Immediate Priority (Critical)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA (RISK-001):</strong> Immediately enforce
MFA for all employees for logging into their computers and accessing any
system containing sensitive or critical data. This is the single most
effective control to prevent unauthorized access.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="high-priority">High Priority</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Establish Security Awareness Training
(RISK-002):</strong> Develop and deploy a mandatory security awareness
training program. The program must be completed by all new hires during
onboarding and by all existing employees at least annually. Content
should focus on identifying phishing, password hygiene, and acceptable
use.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="medium-priority">Medium Priority</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Secure the SSH Service (RISK-003):</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Review the business need for the SSH service on to be accessible
from the public internet.</p></li>
<li><p>If access is required, restrict it to known, trusted IP addresses
using firewall rules.</p></li>
<li><p>Disable password-based authentication and enforce the use of
strong cryptographic keys (e.g., ED25519) for all SSH access.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure the SSH service is kept up-to-date with the latest
security patches.</p></li>
