<p><strong>Cybersecurity Posture Report</strong> <strong>Prepared

<h1 id="executive-overview">Executive Overview</h1>
<p>This report provides a cybersecurity posture assessment for
<strong>Borealis Tech</strong>, based on an analysis of organizational
security controls provided via a questionnaire.</p>
<p>It is critical to note that the technical network scan data
(<code>Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON</code>) and the pre-existing risk data
(<code>Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON</code>) were found to be corrupted and
could not be processed for this report. Consequently, this assessment is
based exclusively on the administrative controls self-reported by the
organization.</p>
<p>The analysis indicates a mixed security posture. The organization has
implemented strong Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) controls across key
systems, which significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access.
However, two critical gaps were identified in foundational security
policies and practices:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of an Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong>
This is a critical deficiency that exposes the organization to insider
threats, misuse of assets, and potential legal liabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of Annual Security Awareness Training:</strong>
While new hires receive training, the lack of a recurring, annual
program for all staff leaves the organization highly vulnerable to
evolving social engineering tactics like phishing.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The overall risk level is assessed as <strong>Moderate</strong>, with
a strong recommendation to immediately address the identified policy and
training gaps. A successful re-scan of the network perimeter is also a
top priority to complete the technical portion of this assessment.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-gaps">Analysis of Gaps</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> The absence of a
formal AUP is a critical administrative gap. This policy is the
foundation for setting user expectations regarding the use of company
technology and data. Without it, there is no formal basis for enforcing
security standards or taking disciplinary action in case of
misuse.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Annual Security Awareness Training:</strong> The threat
landscape evolves continuously. Training provided only to new hires
becomes outdated quickly. A lack of mandatory, annual training for all
employees significantly increases the likelihood that an employee will
fall victim to a phishing email or other social engineering attack,
potentially leading to a major breach.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p><strong>Data Not Available:</strong> The provided network scan data
file (<code>Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON</code>) was determined to be
corrupted or incomplete. As a result, no technical analysis of the
external IP address (<code>114.211.251.84</code>) could be
performed.</p>
<p>This prevents the identification of potential vulnerabilities,
including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Open ports and exposed services.</p></li>
<li><p>Outdated software versions with known exploits (e.g., vulnerable
web servers, SSH, or RDP).</p></li>
<li><p>Insecure service configurations.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A re-scan is required to complete this crucial part of the
assessment.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This risk assessment is based solely on the findings from the
Security Control Review. The pre-existing risk data
(<code>Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON</code>) was unavailable. The severity
is rated on a scale of Low, Medium, High, and Critical.</p>

ransomware, business email compromise, and password hygiene.</p></li>
<li><p>Plan for this training to be a recurring, annual requirement for
all staff.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Execute a New Network Scan:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Conduct a new, validated external vulnerability scan against the
public IP address <code>114.211.251.84</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide the scan results to the security team for a comprehensive
technical analysis and an updated report.</p></li>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="strategic-actions-next-6-12-months">Strategic
Actions (Next 6-12 Months)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Phishing Simulations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Following the initial training, begin a program of regular (e.g.,
quarterly) phishing simulations.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the results to identify individuals or departments that
require additional, targeted training.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Policy Review Cycle:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Establish a formal annual review cycle for the new AUP and any
other security policies to ensure they remain relevant and effective
against emerging threats.</p></li>
