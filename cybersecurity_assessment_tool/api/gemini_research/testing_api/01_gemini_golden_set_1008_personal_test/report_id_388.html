<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">1. Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity assessment
conducted for <strong>Solid State</strong>. The evaluation combined a
technical network scan, a review of organizational security controls,
and an analysis of pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The assessment reveals a mixed security posture. <strong>Solid
State</strong> demonstrates commendable strength in technical access
controls, particularly with the comprehensive implementation of
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across key systems. The external
network scan of the target host <code>192.168.1.100</code> found no open
ports, indicating a robust firewall configuration and a minimal attack
surface for that specific asset.</p>
<p>However, significant and critical gaps were identified in the
organization’s foundational security policies and employee training
programs. The absence of an Acceptable Use Policy and a formal security
awareness training program creates a high risk of security incidents
originating from human error, such as falling victim to phishing or
social engineering attacks. These procedural and administrative
weaknesses currently represent the most significant threat to the
organization’s security and undermine its strong technical controls.</p>
<p>Immediate action is required to develop and implement the recommended
policies and training programs to mitigate these critical risks.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="organizational-information">2. Organizational

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="security-control-review">3. Security Control
Review</h1>
<p>A review of administrative and technical security controls was
conducted based on a standardized questionnaire. The responses indicate
strong preventative measures in user authentication but reveal critical
deficiencies in policy and user education.</p>

</table>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The consistent "No" responses to
fundamental policy and training questions are a major concern. Without
these controls, the organization is highly susceptible to threats that
target employees directly.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">4. Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed to identify open ports and
exposed services on the designated target system.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>192.168.1.100</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Summary:</strong> The scan reported the host as
"up". All 1000 scanned TCP ports were found to be in a
<strong>"closed"</strong> state.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Finding:</strong> No open ports or active services were
detected on the target host.</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> This is a positive security finding.
A host with no externally accessible ports presents a minimal attack
surface from a network perspective. This result suggests the presence of
a well-configured firewall or that the host does not run any
network-facing services, which aligns with security best practices for
systems not intended for public access.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment">5. Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section correlates the findings from the security control review
and technical scan to identify and prioritize risks. No pre-existing
vulnerabilities were provided for this assessment. The primary risks
identified are administrative and procedural in nature.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">6. Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the risk assessment, the following actions are recommended
to improve the security posture of <strong>Solid State</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement a Mandatory Security Awareness Program
(Addresses RISK-001):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop a formal training program for all employees covering
essential topics such as phishing and spear-phishing identification,
password security, safe browsing habits, and incident reporting
procedures.</p></li>
<li><p>This training must be mandatory for all new hires during their
onboarding process.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct annual refresher training for all staff to ensure their
knowledge remains current with the evolving threat landscape. Consider
periodic phishing simulations to test and reinforce learning.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce an Acceptable Use Policy (Addresses
RISK-002):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create a comprehensive AUP that clearly outlines the rules and
responsibilities for employees when using company computers, networks,
email, and data.</p></li>
<li><p>The policy should explicitly prohibit activities that pose a
security risk, such as installing unauthorized software or sharing
credentials.</p></li>
<li><p>Require all employees to read and formally acknowledge the policy
upon hiring and after any significant updates. Ensure the policy is
easily accessible to all staff.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">7. Conclusion</h1>
<p>The security posture of <strong>Solid State</strong> is characterized
by a dichotomy between strong technical controls and weak administrative
safeguards. While the robust implementation of MFA and a secure network
perimeter are highly effective at preventing direct technical exploits,
they do not protect against attacks that exploit human behavior.</p>
<p>The identified gaps in security training and policy represent the
path of least resistance for an attacker. It is imperative that the
organization prioritizes the recommendations in this report to build a
"human firewall" that complements its existing technical defenses.
Addressing these foundational issues will significantly mature the
organization’s overall cybersecurity resilience.</p>
