<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity assessment
conducted for <strong>Arcane Security</strong>. The assessment
incorporated an analysis of organizational security controls via a
questionnaire, a technical network scan of a target host, and a review
of pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The overall security posture reveals a mix of strengths and critical
weaknesses. While the organization has implemented some foundational
policies like an Acceptable Use Policy and annual security training,
there are significant gaps in access control. The absence of
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins presents
a <strong>Critical</strong> risk, as these are primary targets for
account compromise. Furthermore, the lack of security training for new
employees creates a high-risk vulnerability during their initial, most
susceptible period.</p>
<p>On a positive note, the technical network scan of the host at
<code>192.168.1.100</code> found no open ports, indicating a strong
network perimeter or host-based firewall configuration for that specific
system. No pre-existing vulnerabilities were documented.</p>
<p>Immediate remediation should focus on implementing MFA and
establishing a mandatory security training program for all new
hires.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-gaps">Analysis of Gaps</h2>
<p>The review identified three significant control gaps:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Email:</strong> Email is a primary target
for phishing and business email compromise (BEC) attacks. Without MFA, a
compromised password is all an attacker needs to gain access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins:</strong> The absence of
MFA on endpoints (desktops/laptops) significantly increases the risk of
unauthorized access if credentials are stolen, guessed, or
cracked.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Security Training for New Employees:</strong> New
hires are often unfamiliar with company policies and are prime targets
for social engineering. Failing to train them upon hiring leaves a
critical window of vulnerability.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed to identify open ports and exposed
services on the specified target system.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>192.168.1.100</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> 2026-01-31</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="findings">Findings</h2>
<p>The scan of the target host revealed <strong>no open ports</strong>.
All 1000 scanned TCP ports were reported as being in a ‘closed‘
state.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="interpretation">Interpretation</h2>
<p>This is a positive security finding for the scanned host. A "closed"
state indicates that the host is responding to probes but that no
application is listening on the scanned ports. This suggests the
presence of a well-configured host-based firewall or that the system has
no network services exposed, adhering to the principle of least
privilege.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes the findings from the security control
review and technical scan. The following risks have been identified and
prioritized based on their potential impact on the organization.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the identified risks, the following prioritized actions are
recommended to improve the security posture of <strong>Arcane
Security</strong>.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="priority-1-remediate-critical-risks">Priority
1: Remediate Critical Risks</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email and Endpoints:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Enforce mandatory Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for all user accounts across the email system
(e.g., Office 365, Google Workspace) and for all computer/endpoint
logins.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> This is the single most effective
control to prevent unauthorized access from stolen credentials. It
mitigates the risk of account takeover and subsequent malicious
activities.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="priority-2-remediate-high-risks">Priority 2:
Remediate High Risks</h2>
<ol start="2">
<li><p><strong>Establish a New Hire Security Training
Program:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop a mandatory security awareness
training module that is a required part of the onboarding process for
all new employees and contractors, to be completed within their first
week.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> This ensures that all personnel
understand their security responsibilities and can identify common
threats like phishing from the beginning of their tenure, reducing the
organization’s overall attack surface.</p></li>
