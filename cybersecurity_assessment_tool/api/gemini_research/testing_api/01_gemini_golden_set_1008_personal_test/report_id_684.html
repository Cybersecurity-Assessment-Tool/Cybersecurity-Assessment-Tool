<p><strong>Cybersecurity Posture Assessment Report</strong>

<h1 id="executive-overview">Executive Overview</h1>
<p>This report provides a cybersecurity posture assessment for
<strong>Solaris Energy</strong>. The analysis is based on a combination
of self-reported organizational data and technical security scans. The
primary objective is to identify security gaps, assess associated risks,
and provide actionable recommendations to enhance the organization’s
defensive capabilities.</p>
<h4 id="key-findings">Key Findings:</h4>
<p>The assessment reveals a generally positive security posture
regarding employee training and internal system access controls.
However, a critical vulnerability was identified: the absence of
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing email services. This gap
exposes <strong>Solaris Energy</strong> to significant risks, including
Business Email Compromise (BEC), phishing attacks, and unauthorized data
access.</p>
<h4 id="data-limitations">Data Limitations:</h4>
<p>It is crucial to note that the data provided for the external network
scan (<code>Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON</code>) and the list of current
organizational risks (<code>Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON</code>) were
corrupted and could not be processed. Consequently, this report’s
technical findings and risk landscape are incomplete. A comprehensive
understanding of the external attack surface requires a new, successful
network scan.</p>
<h4 id="overall-posture">Overall Posture:</h4>
<p>While foundational security practices are in place, the lack of MFA
on a primary communication and identity platform like email constitutes
a critical risk that outweighs many of the positive controls. Immediate
remediation of this issue is strongly recommended.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following details were provided by the client and used as a
baseline for this assessment.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Organization Name:</strong> Solaris Energy</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Email Domain:</strong>
<code>SolarisEnergy.com</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Website Domain:</strong> <a href="www.SolarisEnergy.com"
class="uri">www.SolarisEnergy.com</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Primary External IP:</strong></p></li>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>This section evaluates the organization’s security posture based on
the provided questionnaire answers. These controls are fundamental to a
robust security program.</p>

<h4 id="analysis">Analysis:</h4>
<p>The questionnaire indicates that <strong>Solaris Energy</strong> has
implemented several key security controls, including MFA for computer
and sensitive system access, as well as a solid security awareness
training program.</p>
<p>However, the lack of MFA for email is a <strong>critical security
gap</strong>. Email accounts are a primary target for attackers. Without
MFA, a compromised password is all an adversary needs to gain access to
sensitive communications, impersonate employees, and launch further
attacks against the organization and its partners.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A technical vulnerability scan of the organization’s external
infrastructure is a standard part of this assessment. This process
involves scanning designated IP addresses to identify open ports,
running services, and potential vulnerabilities.</p>
<h4 id="scan-status">Scan Status:</h4>
<p>The input data for the network scan targeting
<code>[Target IP]</code> was found to be <strong>corrupted and
unreadable</strong>. Therefore, no analysis of open ports, services, or
potential software vulnerabilities could be performed for this
report.</p>
<h4 id="implications">Implications:</h4>
<p>Without this data, the organization’s external attack surface remains
unassessed. Potentially vulnerable services, outdated software, and
misconfigurations exposed to the internet cannot be identified. It is
imperative to conduct a new scan to obtain this critical visibility.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section summarizes the identified risks. Due to the corrupted
input data for pre-existing risks, this assessment is based solely on
the findings from the Security Control Review.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended to
mitigate the identified risks and strengthen the security posture of
<strong>Solaris Energy</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email (Critical):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediately enforce MFA for all users
accessing the email system (<code>SolarisEnergy.com</code>). This is the
single most effective control to prevent unauthorized account
access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> Urgent. Should be completed within 30
days.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct External Vulnerability Scan (High):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Commission a new, comprehensive
vulnerability scan of the external IP address () and any other
internet-facing assets.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> High. Should be initiated as soon as
possible to identify and remediate technical vulnerabilities.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Review and Consolidate Risk Documentation
(Medium):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> The data for existing risks was
unavailable. The organization should ensure it maintains a formal,
accessible risk register. This process helps in tracking, prioritizing,
and managing vulnerabilities over time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> Medium. Should be addressed within the
next quarter.</p></li>
</ul></li>
