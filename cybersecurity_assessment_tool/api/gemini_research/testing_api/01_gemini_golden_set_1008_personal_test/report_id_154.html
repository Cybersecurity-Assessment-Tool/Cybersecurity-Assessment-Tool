<h1 id="executive-overview">Executive Overview</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity assessment for
<strong>Aventine Research</strong>. The analysis is based on a review of
self-reported security controls, a network scan of the designated
external asset, and a review of pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The assessment identified significant gaps in foundational security
controls. The most critical findings are the complete absence of
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all key systems (email,
computers, and sensitive data) and the lack of a security awareness
training program for employees. These deficiencies expose the
organization to a high risk of account compromise, data breaches, and
social engineering attacks such as phishing.</p>
<p>The external network scan of the target IP address
<code>[Target IP]</code> did not reveal any open ports. While this may
indicate a strong firewall configuration, it does not preclude
vulnerabilities on web applications or other services that may be
proxied through a cloud-based provider.</p>
<p>Immediate remediation should focus on implementing MFA and
establishing a comprehensive security awareness training program to
mitigate the most severe risks to the organization.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-controls">Analysis of
Controls</h2>
<p>The review highlights a critical weakness in identity and access
management due to the lack of MFA. Furthermore, the absence of a
security training program indicates a significant vulnerability to
human-centric threats. The presence of an acceptable use policy is a
positive foundational step, but its effectiveness is diminished without
corresponding employee training.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed to identify open ports and
exposed services on the organization’s perimeter.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not provided in scan data.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="findings">Findings</h2>
<p>The network scan did not identify any open TCP or UDP ports on the
target system. All scanned ports were reported as ‘closed‘ or
‘filtered‘.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="interpretation">Interpretation</h2>
<p>This result suggests that the target host is likely protected by a
firewall that is configured to deny unsolicited inbound traffic, which
is a security best practice. However, this does not eliminate all
technical risks. It is possible that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The host was offline or unreachable during the scan.</p></li>
<li><p>Services are hosted on non-standard ports not included in the
scan profile.</p></li>
<li><p>Web applications and other services are hosted through a cloud
provider or Content Delivery Network (CDN), whose IP was not the target
of this scan.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Further authenticated and application-level testing is required for a
comprehensive technical assessment.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment-summary">Risk Assessment Summary</h1>
<p>The following table correlates the findings from the security control
review and technical scan to present a summary of the key risks facing
the organization. No pre-existing vulnerabilities were provided for this

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended to
reduce the identified risks and improve the overall security posture of
<strong>Aventine Research</strong>.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="immediate-actions-critical-priority">Immediate Actions (Critical
Priority)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Priority 1:</strong> Immediately enforce MFA for all user
accounts on the primary email system (e.g., Microsoft 365, Google
Workspace). This is the single most effective control to prevent
business email compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority 2:</strong> Enforce MFA for all remote access
solutions (e.g., VPN) and any external access to systems containing
sensitive data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority 3:</strong> Develop a roadmap to deploy MFA for
all workstation and server logins.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="strategic-actions-high-priority">Strategic
Actions (High Priority)</h2>
<ol start="2">
<li><p><strong>Establish a Security Awareness Training
Program:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Procure and implement a security awareness training solution for
all employees.</p></li>
<li><p>Integrate a training module into the new-hire onboarding
process.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct mandatory, annual training for all staff covering key
topics such as phishing, password security, and the acceptable use
policy.</p></li>
<li><p>Perform periodic phishing simulation campaigns to measure and
improve employee resilience to social engineering.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Validate Network Perimeter Security:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Internally confirm that the scan result for
<code>[Target IP]</code> aligns with the intended firewall
configuration.</p></li>
<li><p>Schedule regular, authenticated vulnerability scans for all
external and internal systems to identify software vulnerabilities that
a port scan would not reveal.</p></li>
