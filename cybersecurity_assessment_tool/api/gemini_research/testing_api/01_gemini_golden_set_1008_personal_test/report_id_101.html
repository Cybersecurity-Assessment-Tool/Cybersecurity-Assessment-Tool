<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>The following table summarizes the organization’s responses to a
security controls questionnaire. "No" answers indicate significant gaps
in the defensive posture and are flagged for immediate attention.</p>
<div class="tabular">
<p><span>@ L<span>8cm</span> c L<span>5cm</span> @</span>
<strong>Control Question</strong> &amp; <strong>Response</strong> &amp;
<strong>Analyst Note</strong><br />
Do you require MFA to access email? &amp; &amp; Good practice. Mitigates
email account takeover.<br />
Do you require MFA to log into computers? &amp; &amp; Strong control for
endpoint security.<br />
<strong>Do you require MFA to access sensitive data systems?</strong>
&amp; <strong></strong> &amp; <strong>Critical Gap.</strong> Lack of MFA
on critical systems drastically increases the risk of a breach via
stolen credentials.<br />
Does your organization have an employee acceptable use policy? &amp;
&amp; Foundational policy is in place.<br />
<strong>Does your organization do security awareness training for new
employees?</strong> &amp; <strong></strong> &amp; <strong>High
Risk.</strong> New hires are a common target for phishing and social
engineering. Lack of initial training leaves the organization
vulnerable.<br />
Does your organization do security awareness training for all employees
at least once per year? &amp; &amp; Good practice for maintaining
security awareness.<br />

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed to identify open ports and exposed
services on the target system.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>10.10.10.51</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Assumed to be current as of report
generation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The scan revealed the following open port:</p>
<div class="tabular">
<p><span>@ l l l L<span>6cm</span> @</span> <strong>Port</strong> &amp;
<strong>State</strong> &amp; <strong>Service Name</strong> &amp;
<strong>Finding</strong><br />
/tcp &amp; Open &amp; <code>ms-wbt-server</code> &amp; The Remote
Desktop Protocol (RDP) service is exposed. This is a high-value target
for attackers and is frequently exploited for initial access, often
leading to ransomware deployment.<br />
</p>
</div>
<h2 id="correlation-with-existing-risks">Correlation with Existing
Risks</h2>
<p>This finding is particularly concerning as it indicates a systemic
issue. A pre-existing risk was documented for RDP exposure on a
different host (<code>10.10.10.50</code>). The discovery of a second
exposed host suggests that network segmentation and firewall
egress/ingress rules may not be consistently applied or enforced.</p>
<h1 id="consolidated-risk-assessment">Consolidated Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes findings from the security control review,
technical scan, and pre-existing risk data into a consolidated list of
key risks facing the organization.</p>
<div class="tabular">
<p><span>@ l L<span>4cm</span> L<span>3.5cm</span> L<span>5cm</span>
@</span> <strong>Severity</strong> &amp; <strong>Risk Title</strong>
&amp; <strong>Affected Asset(s)</strong> &amp;
<strong>Description</strong><br />
<strong>Critical</strong> &amp; Newly Discovered RDP Exposure &amp;
Host: <code>10.10.10.51</code> &amp; Open RDP port allows direct
brute-force or credential-stuffing attacks. This is a primary vector for
ransomware.<br />
<strong>Critical</strong> &amp; Pre-Existing RDP Exposure &amp; Host:
<code>10.10.10.50</code> &amp; A known, unmitigated critical risk. The
presence of multiple exposed hosts elevates the overall organizational
risk significantly.<br />
<strong>High</strong> &amp; Lack of MFA for Sensitive Systems &amp;
Organization-wide &amp; The absence of MFA on critical systems means
that a single compromised password could lead to a major data breach.
This directly exacerbates the RDP exposure risk.<br />
<strong>High</strong> &amp; No Security Training for New Hires &amp;
Organization-wide &amp; New employees are highly susceptible to phishing
attacks. This gap makes it easier for attackers to steal credentials
needed to exploit other vulnerabilities like exposed RDP.<br />
</p>
</div>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended to
improve the security posture of Blue Marble. Recommendations are
prioritized to address the most critical risks first.</p>
<h2 id="immediate-priority-0-7-days">Immediate Priority (0-7 Days)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Remediate RDP Exposure:</strong> Immediately close port
3389 on hosts <code>10.10.10.51</code> and <code>10.10.10.50</code> to
all external traffic. If remote access is required, it must be placed
behind a secure gateway such as a VPN.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Emergency Scan:</strong> Perform a comprehensive
scan of the entire network perimeter and internal subnets to identify
any other instances of exposed RDP or other risky services.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="short-term-priority-1-3-months">Short-Term Priority (1-3
Months)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Deploy Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong>
Prioritize the rollout of MFA for all access to sensitive data systems,
administrative interfaces, and remote access solutions (e.g., VPN). This
is the single most effective control to mitigate the risk of compromised
credentials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement New Hire Security Training:</strong> Develop
and mandate a security awareness training module as part of the
onboarding process for all new employees. This training should cover
phishing, acceptable use, and password hygiene.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="long-term-priority-3-12-months">Long-Term Priority (3-12
Months)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Formalize Remote Access Strategy:</strong> Implement a
formal, secure remote access solution like a Zero Trust Network Access
(ZTNA) gateway or a fully managed VPN. Prohibit direct, unauthenticated
access to internal services from the internet.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Review Network Architecture and Segmentation:</strong>
Conduct a thorough review of the network architecture. Implement network
segmentation to isolate critical systems, preventing lateral movement in
the event of a breach.</p></li>
