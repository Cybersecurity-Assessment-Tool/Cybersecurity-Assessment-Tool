<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a cybersecurity posture assessment for
<strong>Vivid Vision</strong>, based on an analysis of organizational
data and a security controls questionnaire. It is critical to note that
the technical network scan data (<code>Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON</code>)
and the pre-existing risk data (<code>Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON</code>)
were found to be corrupted and could not be processed. Consequently,
this assessment is primarily based on the self-reported security control
questionnaire.</p>
<p>The analysis of the questionnaire reveals several significant gaps in
the organization’s security framework. The most critical findings
include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
Email:</strong> This is a critical vulnerability that exposes the
organization to a high risk of Business Email Compromise (BEC), phishing
attacks, and unauthorized account access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> The lack of a formal AUP creates ambiguity and increases
the risk of insider threats, whether malicious or accidental.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong> New hires are not being equipped with fundamental
security knowledge during their onboarding, making them prime targets
for social engineering attacks.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>While some positive controls are in place, such as MFA for computer
and sensitive system access, the identified gaps represent a significant
risk to the organization’s data, finances, and reputation. This report
provides prioritized, actionable recommendations to mitigate these risks
effectively. A comprehensive re-scan of the network is strongly advised
to complete the technical portion of this assessment.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p><strong>Data Unavailable:</strong> The input file containing the
network scan results (<code>Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON</code>) was found
to be corrupted or incomplete. As a result, no technical analysis of
open ports, running services, or software vulnerabilities could be
performed for the target host <code>[Target IP]</code>.</p>
<p>A full external and internal vulnerability scan is essential for a
comprehensive security assessment. Without this data, the organization’s
exposure to technical exploits remains unknown.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This risk assessment is based exclusively on the gaps identified in
the Security Control Review, as both the technical scan data and
pre-existing risk logs were unavailable. The following table summarizes
the key risks facing the organization.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following prioritized recommendations are provided to address the
identified risks and strengthen the overall security posture of
<strong>Vivid Vision</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>[Critical] Implement MFA for Email
Immediately:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Enforce mandatory MFA for all user
mailboxes. This is the single most effective control to prevent
unauthorized access to email.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Drastically reduces the risk of Business
Email Compromise and successful phishing attacks.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>[High] Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Create a formal AUP that clearly defines
the rules for using company assets, handling data, and accessing the
internet. All employees must read and acknowledge the policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Establishes a clear security baseline
for all employees, reduces legal liability, and provides a framework for
disciplinary action in case of violations.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>[High] Integrate Security Training into New Employee
Onboarding:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop a mandatory security awareness
training module for all new hires. This should be a required part of the
onboarding process before system access is granted.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Equips new employees with the knowledge
to identify and report security threats from their first day, reducing
the organization’s susceptibility to social engineering.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>[Informational] Conduct a Comprehensive Network
Vulnerability Scan:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Schedule a new, authenticated external
and internal network vulnerability scan to identify technical security
flaws that were missed due to the corrupted input data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Provides a complete picture of the
organization’s risk profile by uncovering technical vulnerabilities in
servers, applications, and network devices.</p></li>
