<p><strong>Cybersecurity Posture Assessment Report</strong></p>
<p>Prepared for:</p>
<p><strong>Hearth &amp; Home</strong></p>
<p>2026-01-31</p>
<p><strong>Generated by:</strong></p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the cybersecurity
posture for <strong>Hearth &amp; Home</strong>, based on a review of
organizational security controls, an external network scan, and
pre-existing risk data.</p>
<p>The assessment reveals a mixed security posture. The organization has
implemented several positive security controls, including mandatory
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer and sensitive system
access, as well as a robust security awareness training program for all
employees. These measures significantly strengthen the defense against
common cyber threats.</p>
<p>However, two critical gaps were identified that require immediate
attention. The absence of mandatory MFA for email exposes the
organization to a high risk of account compromise, phishing, and
subsequent data breaches. Additionally, the lack of a formal employee
Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) creates ambiguity regarding security
responsibilities and increases legal and operational risks.</p>
<p>The external network scan of the target IP address
<code>[Target IP]</code> did not identify any open ports. While this
suggests a strong firewall configuration, it does not rule out
vulnerabilities that could be exploited through other vectors.</p>
<p>Our primary recommendations are to enforce MFA for all email accounts
immediately and to develop and implement a comprehensive AUP for all
employees. Addressing these findings will substantially improve the
overall security resilience of Hearth &amp; Home.</p>

<p>A review of organizational security controls was conducted based on a
standardized questionnaire. The results highlight areas of both strength
and weakness in the current security policy framework. "No" answers
indicate significant gaps that elevate organizational risk.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-control-gaps">Analysis of Control
Gaps</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA for Email (Critical Gap):</strong> The lack of MFA on
email is a critical vulnerability. Email accounts are primary targets
for attackers seeking to gain an initial foothold, conduct phishing
campaigns, or perform business email compromise (BEC) attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Acceptable Use Policy (High Risk Gap):</strong> An AUP is
a foundational policy that defines rules and responsibilities for
employees when using company IT assets. Its absence can lead to
inconsistent security practices, misuse of resources, and challenges in
enforcing security standards.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>An external, unauthenticated network scan was performed to identify
exposed services and potential vulnerabilities visible from the public
internet.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Data Not Provided</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="summary-of-findings">Summary of Findings</h2>
<p>The network scan completed successfully but found <strong>no open TCP
or UDP ports</strong> on the target system.</p>
<h4 id="interpretation">Interpretation:</h4>
<p>This result typically indicates a well-configured perimeter firewall
that is effectively blocking unsolicited inbound traffic. This is a
positive security finding, as it significantly reduces the external
attack surface. However, it is important to note that this scan does not
assess for web application vulnerabilities, misconfigurations
exploitable by authenticated users, or threats originating from inside
the network.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="consolidated-risk-assessment">Consolidated
Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes findings from the security control review,
technical scan, and any pre-existing risk data to provide a unified view
of the current risk landscape.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actionable recommendations are prioritized based on the
severity of the identified risks. Implementing these measures will
significantly enhance the security posture of Hearth &amp; Home.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="priority-1-critical-risk-mitigation">Priority
1: Critical Risk Mitigation</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Enforce MFA for Email Immediately:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Enable and enforce MFA for all user
mailboxes without exception.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> This is the single most effective
control to prevent email account takeovers, which are a primary vector
for more severe cyberattacks. This action directly mitigates the
highest-priority risk identified in this report.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="priority-2-high-risk-mitigation">Priority 2:
High Risk Mitigation</h2>
<ol start="2">
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Create a formal AUP document that
clearly outlines the rules for using company technology and data. This
policy should be reviewed by legal counsel, communicated to all
employees, and require a formal acknowledgment of receipt and
understanding.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> An AUP establishes a baseline for
secure employee behavior, supports compliance requirements, and provides
a framework for disciplinary action in case of policy
violations.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="priority-3-proactive-security-enhancements">Priority 3: Proactive
Security Enhancements</h2>
<ol start="3">
<li><p><strong>Implement Comprehensive Vulnerability
Scanning:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Augment external scans with regular,
authenticated internal vulnerability scans and periodic web application
security testing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> While the external posture
appears strong, a comprehensive scanning program is necessary to
identify vulnerabilities that are not visible from the internet but
could be exploited by an attacker who has gained internal
access.</p></li>
