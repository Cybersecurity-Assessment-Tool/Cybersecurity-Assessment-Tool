% --- EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ---
\section{Executive Summary}
This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the cybersecurity posture for Grizzly Peak. The assessment is based on a synthesis of technical network scans, a review of organizational security controls, and an evaluation of pre-existing risk documentation.

The analysis indicates that while the organization has implemented strong foundational controls, such as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across key systems, critical vulnerabilities exist that elevate the overall risk profile.

Key findings include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Critical Database Exposure:} A MySQL database server is publicly accessible from the network. This is confirmed by both technical scans and existing risk logs.
    \item \textbf{Outdated Software:} The exposed MySQL service is running an outdated version (5.7.33), which is no longer actively supported and likely contains unpatched security vulnerabilities.
    \item \textbf{Procedural Gaps:} The organization does not conduct annual security awareness training for all employees, creating a significant gap in its human-centric defenses against threats like phishing and social engineering.
\end{itemize}

Immediate remediation is required to address the exposed database and outdated software. Strengthening the security awareness program is crucial for long-term risk reduction.

% --- ORGANIZATIONAL INFORMATION ---
\section{Organizational Information}
The following information was provided for the assessment.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Attribute} & \textbf{Value} \\
\midrule
Organization Name & Grizzly Peak \\
Email Domain & \texttt{GrizzlyPeak.org} \\
Website Domain & \url{www.GrizzlyPeak.org} \\
External IP & \texttt{173.49.200.88} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

% --- SECURITY CONTROL REVIEW ---
\section{Security Control Review}
This section details the organization's self-reported security controls based on the provided questionnaire. A checkmark (\cmark) indicates a positive control is in place, while a cross (\xmark) indicates a control gap.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{p{0.8\textwidth}c}
\toprule
\textbf{Control Question} & \textbf{Status} \\
\midrule
Do you require MFA to access email? & \cmark \\
Do you require MFA to log into computers? & \cmark \\
Do you require MFA to access sensitive data systems? & \cmark \\
Does your organization have an employee acceptable use policy? & \cmark \\
Does your organization do security awareness training for new employees? & \cmark \\
\textbf{Does your organization do security awareness training for all employees at least once per year?} & \xmark \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection*{Analysis}
The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to identity and access management through its comprehensive enforcement of MFA. However, the lack of mandatory annual security awareness training for all staff is a significant procedural weakness. This gap increases the organization's susceptibility to social engineering attacks, as employee knowledge of current threats may become outdated.

% --- TECHNICAL SCAN RESULTS ---
\section{Technical Scan Results}
A network scan was performed to identify open ports and exposed services on the target system.

\subsection*{Scan Details}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Target IP Address:} \texttt{172.16.50.20}
    \item \textbf{Scanner Used:} Nmap
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Open Ports and Services}
The following table summarizes the services discovered to be accessible on the target system.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l l l l l}
\toprule
\textbf{Port} & \textbf{State} & \textbf{Service} & \textbf{Product} & \textbf{Version} \\
\midrule
3306/tcp & open & mysql & MySQL & 5.7.33 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection*{Analysis}
The scan confirms that a MySQL database service is exposed on port 3306. The identified version, \textbf{MySQL 5.7.33}, was released in early 2021. The MySQL 5.7 branch reached its end-of-life in October 2023 and no longer receives security patches. Running outdated, un-patched software, especially when exposed to the network, presents a critical security risk.

% --- SYNTHESIZED RISK ASSESSMENT ---
\section{Synthesized Risk Assessment}
The following table correlates findings from the organizational questionnaire, the technical scan, and pre-existing risk documentation into a unified list of identified risks.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{p{0.1\textwidth} p{0.3\textwidth} p{0.15\textwidth} p{0.35\textwidth}}
\toprule
\textbf{Risk ID} & \textbf{Risk Title} & \textbf{Severity} & \textbf{Description} \\
\midrule
\textbf{RISK-01} & Publicly Exposed Database Service & \textbf{High (7.5)} & The MySQL database port (3306) is open to the network. This was identified in pre-existing risk logs and validated by the technical scan. This exposure allows attackers to directly target the database for brute-force attacks, credential theft, or exploitation of vulnerabilities. \\
\addlinespace
\textbf{RISK-02} & Outdated Database Software & \textbf{High} & The exposed MySQL service is running version 5.7.33, which is outdated and no longer supported. This version is known to have vulnerabilities that could be exploited by an attacker to achieve remote code execution or data exfiltration. \\
\addlinespace
\textbf{RISK-03} & Inadequate Security Training Program & \textbf{Medium} & The lack of mandatory annual security training for all employees was identified in the security controls questionnaire. This administrative gap weakens the human firewall, increasing the likelihood of successful phishing, business email compromise, and other social engineering attacks. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

% --- RECOMMENDATIONS ---
\section{Recommendations}
The following actionable recommendations are provided to mitigate the identified risks.

\subsection*{RISK-01: Publicly Exposed Database Service (High)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Immediate Action:} Implement strict firewall rules to block all public access to TCP port 3306 on asset \texttt{172.16.50.20}. Access should be restricted to a whitelist of trusted internal IP addresses only.
    \item \textbf{Long-Term Solution:} For any required remote administrative access, mandate the use of a secure Virtual Private Network (VPN) with MFA. This ensures that all connections to the database are encrypted and properly authenticated.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{RISK-02: Outdated Database Software (High)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Immediate Action:} Develop a patch management and upgrade plan for the MySQL server.
    \item \textbf{Long-Term Solution:} Execute the plan to upgrade the MySQL instance from version 5.7 to a currently supported major version (e.g., MySQL 8.x). This will ensure the system receives ongoing security updates from the vendor.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{RISK-03: Inadequate Security Training Program (Medium)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Immediate Action:} Procure and schedule a mandatory security awareness training program for all current employees.
    \item \textbf{Long-Term Solution:} Establish a formal policy requiring all employees to complete security awareness training on an annual basis. This program should cover current threats such as phishing, ransomware, and proper data handling.
\end{itemize}
