<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for <strong>Firebrand Media</strong>, based on a combination of
self-reported organizational data, an external network scan, and a
review of pre-existing risks. The assessment identifies the
organization’s security strengths, weaknesses, and a prioritized list of
actionable recommendations to enhance its security posture.</p>
<p>The analysis revealed critical gaps in access control policies.
Specifically, the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
computer logins and access to sensitive data systems represents a
significant vulnerability. Furthermore, the lack of a formal security
awareness training program for both new and existing employees elevates
the risk of human-error-related incidents, such as phishing and social
engineering attacks.</p>
<p>On a positive note, the external network scan of the target IP
address <code>[Target IP]</code> did not reveal any open ports. This
suggests a restrictive firewall policy is in place for the scanned
asset, which effectively minimizes its external attack surface. The
organization also enforces MFA for email access, a commendable security
control.</p>
<p>The highest priority recommendations are to immediately implement a
comprehensive MFA policy across all critical systems and to establish a
recurring security awareness training program for all employees.
Addressing these findings will substantially mitigate the risk of
unauthorized access and strengthen the organization’s overall defense
against common cyber threats.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-controls">Analysis of
Controls</h2>
<p>The questionnaire highlights critical weaknesses in access control
and employee security training. The lack of MFA for computer and
sensitive data access significantly increases the risk of account
compromise. The absence of a security awareness training program leaves
the organization highly susceptible to phishing and other social
engineering attacks.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network vulnerability scan was conducted to identify open
ports and services exposed to the internet.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Summary:</strong> The scan completed successfully
but did not identify any open TCP or UDP ports on the target
system.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-scan-results">Analysis of Scan
Results</h2>
<p>The absence of open ports is a positive finding, indicating that the
target system has a minimal external attack surface. This is likely due
to a well-configured firewall that denies unsolicited inbound traffic.
While this reduces the risk of external network-based attacks against
this specific IP, it does not preclude vulnerabilities in web
applications, client-side attacks, or threats from internal sources.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following prioritized recommendations are provided to address the
identified risks and improve the overall security posture of
<strong>Firebrand Media</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Comprehensive Multi-Factor Authentication
(Critical)</strong><br />
To mitigate the risk of unauthorized access (R-01), MFA should be
implemented immediately.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Phase 1 (Immediate):</strong> Enforce MFA on all systems
containing sensitive or critical data. This includes databases, file
servers, and administrative portals.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Phase 2 (Short-Term):</strong> Roll out MFA for all
employee computer logins (e.g., Windows, macOS).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Technology:</strong> Utilize strong MFA methods such as
authenticator applications (e.g., Google Authenticator, Microsoft
Authenticator) or FIDO2-compliant hardware keys.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish a Security Awareness Training Program
(High)</strong><br />
To address the risks associated with human error (R-02), a formal and
continuous security awareness program should be established.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Onboarding:</strong> Integrate mandatory security
awareness training into the onboarding process for all new
employees.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Annual Training:</strong> Conduct comprehensive training
for all staff at least once per year to cover topics like phishing
identification, password hygiene, and acceptable use policies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Phishing Simulations:</strong> Perform regular, simulated
phishing campaigns to test employee awareness and provide targeted,
just-in-time training to those who fall victim.</p></li>
</ul></li>
