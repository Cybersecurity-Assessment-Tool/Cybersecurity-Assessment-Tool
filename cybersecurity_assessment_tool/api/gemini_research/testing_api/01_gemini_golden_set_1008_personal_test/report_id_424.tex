% --- Section 1: Executive Summary ---
\section{Executive Summary}
This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the cybersecurity posture for \textbf{Skyward Bound}, based on a combination of technical network scanning, a review of existing risks, and an organizational security controls questionnaire.

The assessment identified a mixed security posture. On the technical front, the scanned host (\texttt{192.168.1.100}) demonstrated a strong defensive configuration, with no open ports detected. This indicates effective firewalling and network segmentation.

However, the organizational security control review revealed two significant gaps that present a high degree of risk to the organization:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Critical Risk:} Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not required for accessing sensitive data systems. This gap significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical information assets through compromised credentials.
    \item \textbf{High Risk:} A mandatory, annual security awareness training program for all employees is not in place. This elevates the organization's susceptibility to social engineering attacks, such as phishing, which remain a primary vector for security breaches.
\end{itemize}

Immediate remediation of these policy and procedural gaps is strongly recommended to reduce the attack surface and enhance the overall security resilience of \textbf{Skyward Bound}. Detailed findings and actionable recommendations are provided in the subsequent sections of this report.

\section{Organizational Information}
The following details were provided for the assessment.

% --- Section 3: Security Control Review ---
\section{Security Control Review}
An organizational questionnaire was completed to assess the implementation of key administrative and policy-based security controls. The results are summarized below. Answers marked with \textcolor{red}{\ding{55}} indicate a deviation from security best practices and represent a potential risk.

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering

Do you require MFA to log into computers? & \textcolor{green}{\ding{51}} \\
Do you require MFA to access sensitive data systems? & \textcolor{criticalred}{\ding{55}} \\
Does your organization have an employee acceptable use policy? & \textcolor{green}{\ding{51}} \\
Does your organization do security awareness training for new employees? & \textcolor{green}{\ding{51}} \\
Does your organization do security awareness training for all employees at least once per year? & \textcolor{highorange}{\ding{55}} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Security Controls Questionnaire Results}
\end{table}

\subsection*{Analysis of Gaps}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{MFA on Sensitive Systems:} The absence of MFA on systems housing sensitive data is a critical vulnerability. Should an attacker compromise a user's password, they would gain direct access to the organization's most valuable data.
    \item \textbf{Annual Security Training:} While training for new hires is a good first step, the security landscape is constantly evolving. Without regular, ongoing training for all staff, the organization is more vulnerable to phishing, ransomware, and other social engineering tactics.
\end{itemize}

% --- Section 4: Technical Scan Results ---
\section{Technical Scan Results}
A network scan was conducted to identify open ports and exposed services on the specified target.

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\rowcolors{2}{gray!10}{white}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\rowcolor{tablehead}

Scan Date & \today \\
Target Status & \textbf{Up} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Network Scan Metadata}
\end{table}

\subsection*{Findings}
The scan of the target host concluded successfully. The host was responsive, but \textbf{no open ports were detected}. All scanned ports were found to be in a 'closed' state. This is a positive security finding, suggesting that the host is well-protected by a firewall or has no network services exposed to the scanner's point of origin.

% --- Section 5: Consolidated Risk Assessment ---
\section{Consolidated Risk Assessment}
This section synthesizes findings from the security control review, technical scans, and pre-existing risk data. As no pre-existing vulnerabilities were reported and the technical scan yielded no findings, the risks listed below originate from the organizational control gaps.

% --- Section 6: Recommendations ---
\section{Recommendations}
The following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified risks and improve the overall security posture of \textbf{Skyward Bound}.

\subsection*{ORG-001: Implement MFA on Sensitive Systems (Critical)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Action:} Immediately prioritize and execute a project to implement and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all applications, databases, and administrative interfaces that process or store sensitive organizational data.
    \item \textbf{Justification:} This is the single most effective control to prevent unauthorized access resulting from stolen credentials. It provides a critical layer of defense for the organization's most valuable assets.
    \item \textbf{Priority:} \textbf{Immediate}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{ORG-002: Establish Annual Security Training Program (High)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Action:} Develop and mandate a formal security awareness training program for all employees, to be completed annually. This program should cover current threats such as phishing, ransomware, secure password practices, and acceptable use of company assets.
    \item \textbf{Justification:} A well-informed workforce is a critical component of a defense-in-depth strategy. Regular training transforms employees from potential targets into an active line of defense, capable of recognizing and reporting threats.
    \item \textbf{Priority:} \textbf{High}
\end{itemize}
