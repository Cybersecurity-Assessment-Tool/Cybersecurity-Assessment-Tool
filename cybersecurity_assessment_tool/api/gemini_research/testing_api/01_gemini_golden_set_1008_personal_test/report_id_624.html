<p><strong>Cybersecurity Posture Report</strong> <strong>Prepared

<p><em>Analysis of Organizational Controls and Technical
Findings</em></p>

<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a cybersecurity assessment for <strong>Skyward
Bound</strong>, synthesizing information from an organizational
questionnaire, a technical network scan, and a review of pre-existing
risks.</p>
<p>The analysis reveals a mixed security posture. The organization
demonstrates strong identity and access management practices, with
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) consistently enforced across email,
computer logins, and sensitive data systems. This significantly reduces
the risk of unauthorized access through compromised credentials.</p>
<p>However, critical gaps were identified in foundational governance and
human-factor controls. The absence of an employee <strong>Acceptable Use
Policy (AUP)</strong> and the lack of <strong>security awareness
training for new employees</strong> represent significant
vulnerabilities. These policy and training deficiencies create an
environment where employees may be unaware of security best practices,
making the organization more susceptible to social engineering and
insider threats.</p>
<p>Compounding these issues, the provided technical network scan data
and the list of current risks were found to be corrupted and could not
be analyzed. This prevents a complete assessment of the external attack
surface and the existing risk landscape. Recommendations in this report
focus on immediately addressing the identified policy gaps and
re-initiating technical assessments to gain a full picture of the
organization’s security posture.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-control-gaps">Analysis of Control
Gaps</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> The lack of an AUP
is a <strong>critical</strong> governance failure. An AUP is a
foundational document that sets clear expectations for employees
regarding the use of company assets, data handling, and online behavior.
Without it, there is no formal basis for enforcing security standards or
taking corrective action against policy violations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>New Employee Onboarding Training:</strong> The absence of
security training during onboarding is a <strong>high-risk</strong> gap.
New hires are often prime targets for phishing and other social
engineering attacks. Failing to provide immediate training leaves a
window of vulnerability where new staff may inadvertently expose the
organization to threats. While annual training is in place, the initial
onboarding phase is a critical moment to establish a security-conscious
mindset.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was intended to be performed against the
organization’s public-facing infrastructure to identify open ports,
running services, and potential vulnerabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Status: Data Unavailable.</strong> The provided network scan
data file (<code>Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON</code>) was found to be
corrupted or incomplete. As a result, no analysis of the external
technical posture could be performed. The intended target for this scan
was <code>[Target IP]</code>. A full assessment of the external attack
surface is not possible without this data.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes findings from all available data sources.
Due to data corruption in the technical scan and existing risk inputs,
this assessment is based primarily on the security control review.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The list of pre-existing vulnerabilities
(<code>Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON</code>) was also found to be broken
and could not be incorporated into this analysis.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended to
mitigate the identified risks and improve the overall security posture
of <strong>Skyward Bound</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>[Immediate] Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use
Policy (AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Draft a comprehensive AUP that clearly
defines rules for computer, network, email, and internet usage. It
should cover topics such as data handling, password security, and
prohibited activities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Establishes a baseline for security
governance and provides a legal and administrative framework for
enforcing security standards.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>[Immediate] Institute Mandatory Onboarding Security
Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Create a security awareness training
module that is a mandatory part of the new employee onboarding process.
This training should cover the new AUP, phishing identification,
password hygiene, and incident reporting.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Reduces the risk posed by new employees
and fosters a security-first culture from day one of
employment.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>[High Priority] Conduct a New External Vulnerability
Scan:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Commission a new, authenticated and
unauthenticated vulnerability scan of the external IP address
(<code>147.194.185.109</code>) and any other public-facing
assets.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Provides critical visibility into the
technical attack surface, allowing for the identification and
remediation of exploitable vulnerabilities.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>[Medium Priority] Formalize Risk Management
Process:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Since the existing risk data was
unavailable, establish a formal process to identify, assess, and
document organizational risks. This should be reviewed on at least an
annual basis.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Ensures that all significant risks
(technical, administrative, and physical) are known and managed
effectively.</p></li>
</ul></li>
