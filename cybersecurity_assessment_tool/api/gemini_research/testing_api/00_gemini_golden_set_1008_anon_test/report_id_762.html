<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive assessment of the cybersecurity
posture for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on an analysis
of provided organizational data, network scan results, and pre-existing
risk information.</p>
<p>The assessment reveals a mixed security posture. While the network
scan identified no critical open ports, indicating a potentially
well-hardened external perimeter at the time of scanning for the target
provided, several significant control gaps were identified through the
organizational questionnaire. Specifically, the lack of Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and the absence of security
awareness training for new employees represent high-risk areas that
could lead to unauthorized access and successful social engineering
attacks.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a pre-existing risk regarding an unencrypted web server
was noted, though the current network scan indicates that Port 80 is
presently closed, suggesting a potential remediation or a different
context for the pre-existing finding.</p>
<p>Immediate recommendations focus on implementing robust MFA across all
systems, establishing mandatory security awareness training for all new
hires, and verifying the status of pre-existing risks. Addressing these
critical gaps will significantly enhance the overall security resilience
of the organization.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-questionnaire-gaps">Analysis of
Questionnaire Gaps</h2>
<p>Two critical security gaps were identified from the
questionnaire:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins:</strong> Not requiring
Multi-Factor Authentication for computer logins significantly increases
the risk of unauthorized access through compromised credentials. This is
a fundamental security control that should be implemented across all
organizational workstations and servers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong> The absence of initial security awareness training
for new hires means that new employees might not be aware of critical
security policies, phishing threats, or best practices from day one,
making them immediate targets for social engineering attacks.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed to identify active hosts, open ports,
and services on the specified target.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Target:</strong> <code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not provided.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Used:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> The target host was identified as
<strong>up</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="port-and-service-findings">Port and Service
Findings</h2>
<p>The network scan identified no open ports on the target.
Specifically, port 80 was found to be <strong>closed</strong>. This
indicates a potentially well-hardened external perimeter for the scanned
target. No services were detected as running on open ports, as no open
ports were found.</p>

</div>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="risk-analysis-and-correlation">Risk Analysis
and Correlation</h2>
<p>The most immediate and impactful risks are operational, stemming from
gaps in security policies and training. The lack of MFA for computer
logins is a critical vulnerability that could lead to significant data
breaches or system compromise. Similarly, inadequate training for new
employees creates a human-factor vulnerability that can be exploited
through phishing or other social engineering tactics.</p>
<p>The pre-existing "Unencrypted Web Server" risk needs clarification.
While the network scan shows Port 80 as closed, the existence of this
risk in the organizational records warrants investigation. It’s possible
the risk pertains to a different target, a previous configuration, or a
policy concern that unencrypted services should not be present even if
currently closed. For assessment purposes, we note the discrepancy and
the potential for it to have been remediated.</p>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following recommendations are provided to address the identified
security gaps and enhance the overall cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer
Logins:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Mandate and deploy MFA for all employee computer
logins, including desktops, laptops, and virtual machines.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Significantly reduces the risk of credential
theft and unauthorized access, even if passwords are
compromised.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Priority:</em> <strong>Critical</strong></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish New Employee Security Awareness
Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Develop and implement a mandatory security
awareness training program for all new employees during their onboarding
process.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Ensures all staff are immediately aware of
cybersecurity policies, threats (e.g., phishing), and best practices,
reducing human-factor vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Priority:</em> <strong>High</strong></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Validate and Address Pre-existing "Unencrypted Web
Server" Risk:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Investigate the origins and context of the
"Unencrypted Web Server" risk. Verify if this risk pertains to a
different system or if the issue was indeed remediated. If any
unencrypted web services are intended to be deployed, ensure they are
secured with SSL/TLS and exposed only when absolutely necessary,
preferably behind a firewall.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Ensures all documented risks are accurate and
addressed, preventing re-introduction of vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Priority:</em> <strong>Medium</strong></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Security Audits and Scans:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Conduct periodic internal and external
vulnerability scans and penetration tests to identify new
weaknesses.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Proactively identifies vulnerabilities before
they can be exploited.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Priority:</em> <strong>Ongoing</strong></p></li>
</ul></li>
