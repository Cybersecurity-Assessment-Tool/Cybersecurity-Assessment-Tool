<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive assessment of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>’s current cybersecurity posture,
synthesizing insights from a recent network scan, a security controls
questionnaire, and a review of pre-existing organizational risks. While
foundational controls such as MFA for email and an Acceptable Use Policy
are in place, critical gaps exist concerning Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) implementation for computer logins and sensitive data systems, as
well as a lack of security awareness training for new employees. The
network scan identified no open ports, which is a positive security
indicator and suggests previous risks related to an unencrypted web
server on port 80 may have been mitigated. Addressing the identified
control gaps and maintaining vigilance against re-emerging
vulnerabilities are paramount for strengthening the overall security
posture.</p>

of Security Control Gaps</h2>
<p>The questionnaire highlights three critical areas requiring immediate
attention:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Computer Logins:</strong> Without MFA,
user credentials alone are sufficient to gain access to internal
systems, significantly increasing the risk of unauthorized access due to
phishing or credential theft.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> This
represents a high-priority risk, as compromise of these systems could
lead to severe data breaches, regulatory fines, and extensive
reputational damage.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong> New hires are frequently targeted by social
engineering attacks as they may be less familiar with organizational
security policies and common threat vectors. Comprehensive onboarding
training is crucial to establish a secure culture from day one.</p></li>

</div>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="correlation-and-analysis">Correlation and
Analysis</h2>
<p>The primary risks identified in this assessment stem from critical
organizational security control gaps, particularly the pervasive lack of
robust MFA enforcement across sensitive systems and an insufficient
onboarding security training program. While the network scan revealed a
strong external posture with no open ports, which is a significant
improvement if port 80 was indeed previously open, it does not mitigate
the internal risks associated with poor control implementation. The
pre-existing "Unencrypted Web Server" risk, although currently mitigated
by the closed state of port 80, serves as an important reminder to
ensure any web services, if deployed in the future, are always
configured with strong encryption (HTTPS/SSL/TLS). The highest priority
for remediation should be given to implementing MFA for sensitive data
systems and computer logins.</p>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To significantly enhance its cybersecurity posture and mitigate the
identified risks, <strong>[Organization Name]</strong> should prioritize
the following actionable recommendations:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for All
Computer Logins:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Deploy and enforce MFA for all user accounts accessing company
computers and network resources.</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluate various MFA solutions (e.g., hardware tokens,
authenticator apps, biometrics) and choose one that aligns with
organizational needs and user experience while offering strong
security.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive
Data Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mandate MFA for all access to systems containing sensitive
organizational or client data, prioritizing the most critical
assets.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct a comprehensive inventory of all sensitive data systems
to ensure complete coverage.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Mandatory Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and integrate a comprehensive security awareness training
module into the new employee onboarding process.</p></li>
<li><p>Cover essential topics such as phishing identification, social
engineering tactics, password best practices, secure data handling, and
incident reporting procedures.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Network Configuration Review and
Hardening:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement a robust process for regular review of network
configurations and firewall rules to ensure only absolutely necessary
ports are open and services are exposed to the network.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure any web services are always deployed with HTTPS/SSL/TLS
encryption by default and adhere to modern cryptographic
standards.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Scheduled Vulnerability Assessments and Penetration
Testing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Conduct periodic external and internal vulnerability scans and
penetration tests to proactively identify and remediate potential
weaknesses before malicious actors can exploit them.</p></li>
<li><p>This ensures a continuous cycle of security improvement and
validation.</p></li>
</ul></li>
