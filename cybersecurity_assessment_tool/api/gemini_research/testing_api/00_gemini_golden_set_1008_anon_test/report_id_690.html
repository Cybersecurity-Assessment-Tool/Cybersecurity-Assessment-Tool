<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a cybersecurity posture assessment for
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on a review of
organizational security controls, a targeted network scan, and an
analysis of existing risk data. The assessment identified several
critical gaps in security best practices, particularly concerning
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for sensitive data systems, the
absence of an employee acceptable use policy, and deficiencies in
regular security awareness training.</p>
<p>The network scan of indicated no open ports, which is a positive
external posture. However, a pre-existing risk entry noted an
"Unencrypted Web Server" on Port 80, which contradicts the scan findings
and warrants immediate verification. Overall, the organization has
foundational controls in place for some areas, but key weaknesses expose
it to various threats, particularly from internal user actions and
potential unverified external exposures. Recommendations are provided to
mitigate identified risks and improve the overall security stance.</p>

Port 80 is <strong>closed</strong>, the organization’s existing risk
register explicitly notes an "Unencrypted Web Server" where "Port 80 is
open." If this pre-existing risk is accurate or becomes active, an
unencrypted web service could expose sensitive data in transit. This
discrepancy requires urgent verification.</td>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and enhance the overall cybersecurity
posture, the following recommendations are provided.</p>
<h2 id="immediate-actions">Immediate Actions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong>
Mandate Multi-Factor Authentication for all systems and applications
handling sensitive organizational data. Prioritize systems with the
highest impact or most critical data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a comprehensive AUP outlining the proper use of
company resources, data, and systems. Ensure all employees are required
to read, understand, and acknowledge this policy. Integrate it into
onboarding and annual compliance programs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Verify and Address Port 80 Discrepancy:</strong>
Immediately investigate the discrepancy regarding Port 80.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If Port 80 is indeed closed as per the recent scan, update the
risk register to reflect this and confirm no web services are
inadvertently exposed.</p></li>
<li><p>If Port 80 is actually open (contradicting the scan), ensure any
web service running on it is protected with HTTPS/TLS encryption. If
it’s not needed, close the port.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="long-term-strategy">Long-Term Strategy</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Establish Annual Security Awareness Training
Program:</strong> Implement a mandatory annual security awareness
training program for all employees. This training should cover current
threats (e.g., phishing, social engineering), data handling best
practices, and organizational security policies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Review of Security Policies:</strong>
Periodically review and update all security policies, including the AUP
and MFA requirements, to adapt to evolving threats and organizational
changes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Continuous Vulnerability Management:</strong> Implement a
continuous vulnerability scanning and management program to regularly
assess network and application security. This helps in proactive
identification and remediation of new vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Incident Response Planning:</strong> Develop and
regularly test an incident response plan to ensure the organization can
effectively detect, respond to, and recover from security
incidents.</p></li>
