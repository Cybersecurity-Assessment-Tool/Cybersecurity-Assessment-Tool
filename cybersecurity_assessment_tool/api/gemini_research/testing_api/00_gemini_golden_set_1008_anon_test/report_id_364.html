<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, synthesizing data from a
recent network scan, an organizational security questionnaire, and
existing risk data.</p>
<p>The network scan of indicated no open ports, which is a positive
finding for the external perimeter’s hardening at the time of the scan.
However, a review of organizational security controls revealed several
critical policy and procedural gaps. Key findings include the absence of
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access, a lack of an
employee acceptable use policy, and insufficient annual security
awareness training for all employees. These deficiencies expose the
organization to significant risks, particularly from social engineering
and account compromise attacks.</p>
<p>Immediate action is recommended to implement MFA for email, establish
a clear acceptable use policy, and roll out mandatory annual security
awareness training. Addressing these areas will substantially elevate
the overall security posture and reduce the likelihood of successful
cyberattacks.</p>

<h2 id="questionnaire-analysis">Questionnaire Analysis</h2>
<p>The questionnaire responses highlight the following critical areas of
concern:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Email (Q1):</strong> The absence of
Multi-Factor Authentication for email access is a severe vulnerability.
Email accounts are frequent targets for phishing and credential stuffing
attacks. Without MFA, a compromised password could grant an attacker
full access to an employee’s inbox, leading to business email compromise
(BEC), data exfiltration, or further internal network
penetration.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (Q4):</strong>
Not having an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) leaves the organization
vulnerable to employee misuse of IT resources. Without clear guidelines,
employees may engage in activities that introduce malware, violate data
handling policies, or expose the organization to legal and reputational
risks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inadequate Annual Security Awareness Training
(Q6):</strong> While new employees receive training, the lack of
recurring annual security awareness training for all staff is a
significant weakness. Cyber threats constantly evolve, and without
regular updates, employees may not be equipped to recognize and respond
to the latest phishing tactics, social engineering schemes, or malware
threats, eroding initial training effectiveness.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was conducted on to identify publicly accessible
services and potential vulnerabilities.</p>
<h2 id="scan-summary">Scan Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> 2026-01-26</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> The target host was identified as
being online and responsive.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports Detected:</strong> None.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Extra Port State:</strong> All other scanned ports were
found to be <code>closed</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Utilized:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="detailed-findings">Detailed Findings</h2>
<p>The Nmap scan performed against reported that the host was ‘up‘ but
did not identify any open ports. All ports scanned were reported as
‘closed‘. This indicates a well-hardened external perimeter, suggesting
that no network services are currently exposed to the internet on the
scanned IP address. This is a positive security posture from an external
attack surface perspective at the time of the scan. No specific service
versions or products were detected due to the absence of open ports.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section consolidates the findings from the security
questionnaire, technical scan, and any reported existing vulnerabilities
into a comprehensive risk overview.</p>

<h2 id="risk-correlation">Risk Correlation</h2>
<p>The primary risks identified for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>
are operational and policy-based, as revealed by the security
questionnaire. The network scan did not uncover any immediate technical
vulnerabilities on the external perimeter. No pre-existing
vulnerabilities were reported in the provided data.</p>
<p>The most significant risks are centered around human factors and
policy enforcement:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A successful phishing attack against an employee’s email account
(due to lack of MFA) could bypass the strong external perimeter and
provide an attacker with an initial foothold.</p></li>
<li><p>The absence of an AUP increases the likelihood of employees
inadvertently creating security risks (e.g., installing unauthorized
software, visiting malicious websites) that could compromise internal
systems despite the hardened external face.</p></li>
<li><p>The lack of consistent, updated security training means employees
are less likely to identify and report suspicious activities, making the
organization more vulnerable to new attack vectors.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To significantly improve the cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, the following recommendations are
provided, ordered by priority based on the identified risks.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email
Access (High Priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Enable and strictly enforce MFA for all organizational email
accounts. Prioritize strong MFA methods (e.g., authenticator apps,
hardware tokens) over less secure options like SMS.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct an awareness campaign to educate employees on the
importance of MFA and provide clear instructions for setup and
usage.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement a Comprehensive Employee Acceptable
Use Policy (AUP) (High Priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Draft a clear and concise AUP outlining the appropriate use of
all organizational IT assets, including computers, networks, internet,
software, and data.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure the AUP covers data handling, privacy expectations,
personal device usage guidelines, and prohibited activities.</p></li>
<li><p>Mandate that all employees read, understand, and formally
acknowledge the AUP, ideally on an annual basis or upon significant
updates.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Mandatory Annual Security Awareness Training
for All Employees (Medium Priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Design and implement a recurring annual security awareness
training program that targets all employees, not just new
hires.</p></li>
<li><p>Training content should be engaging, up-to-date with current
threat landscapes (e.g., sophisticated phishing, ransomware, deepfakes),
and include practical advice for recognizing and reporting
incidents.</p></li>
<li><p>Supplement training with regular simulated phishing exercises to
test employee vigilance and reinforce learned behaviors.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Maintain Strong External Perimeter and Conduct Regular
Scans (Ongoing):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Continue to monitor and review firewall rules and network
configurations to ensure no unnecessary ports or services are
inadvertently exposed.</p></li>
<li><p>Schedule periodic external vulnerability assessments and
penetration tests to proactively identify and address any new exposures
or misconfigurations.</p></li>
</ul></li>
