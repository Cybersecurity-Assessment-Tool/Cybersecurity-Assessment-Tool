<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report presents a comprehensive assessment of the organization’s
cybersecurity posture, synthesizing data from an organizational security
questionnaire, a network scan, and pre-existing risk information. The
analysis identifies several critical security gaps, predominantly in the
implementation of multi-factor authentication (MFA) for key systems and
the establishment of foundational security policies and employee
training programs. While the technical network scan reported no
currently open ports, a pre-existing risk concerning an unencrypted web
server requires further investigation to reconcile with current
findings. Immediate recommendations are provided to address these gaps
and enhance the organization’s overall security posture.</p>

<li><p><strong>Summary of Findings:</strong> The network scan reported
no open ports on the target . Specifically, port 80 was found to be

minimal external attack surface from network-based vulnerabilities
related to publicly exposed services. No services, products, or versions

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the comprehensive analysis, the following prioritized
recommendations are provided to address identified risks and enhance the
organization’s cybersecurity posture:</p>
<h2 id="prioritized-action-items">Prioritized Action Items</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email
Access:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Mandate the use of MFA for all user accounts
accessing organizational email services.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Significantly reduces the risk of email account
compromise, which can lead to phishing, business email compromise (BEC)
attacks, and unauthorized data access.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive
Data Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Enforce MFA for authentication to all systems,
applications, and databases that store, process, or transmit sensitive
organizational data.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Provides an essential layer of security,
protecting critical data from unauthorized access even if primary
credentials are stolen or guessed.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Draft, formally approve, and widely disseminate
a comprehensive AUP that clearly outlines appropriate use of company IT
resources, data, and internet access. All employees should acknowledge
receipt and understanding.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Establishes clear expectations for employee
conduct, mitigates insider threat risks, ensures legal compliance, and
provides a basis for disciplinary action if policies are
violated.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Mandatory Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Institute a mandatory security awareness
training program as a core component of the onboarding process for all
new hires.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Ensures that all employees understand their
individual responsibilities in maintaining security from their very
first day, significantly reducing the risk of human-factor
vulnerabilities such as phishing and social engineering.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Investigate and Address "Unencrypted Web Server"
Risk:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Conduct an immediate investigation to reconcile
the pre-existing risk (reporting Port 80 open with an unencrypted web
server) with the current network scan results (Port 80 closed).
Determine if the risk was remediated, if it applies to a different
system, or if the scan had an incomplete scope.</p></li>
<li><p><em>If the risk is still valid for other systems:</em> Ensure all
public-facing web services utilize HTTPS exclusively, with properly
configured and valid SSL/TLS certificates. Implement redirects for all
HTTP traffic to HTTPS.</p></li>
<li><p><em>If Port 80 was indeed remediated by being closed:</em>
Confirm the remediation steps, update the organization’s risk register
accordingly, and ensure no other unencrypted web services are
inadvertently exposed.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Eliminates data interception risks, builds
trust with users, and ensures compliance with modern security standards
and best practices.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The organization demonstrates a baseline understanding and
implementation of some security controls, such as requiring MFA for
computer login and conducting annual security awareness training.
However, critical vulnerabilities persist in key areas, including
comprehensive MFA implementation for email and sensitive data systems,
fundamental policy documentation (e.g., an AUP), and initial security
training for new hires. The recent network scan indicates a minimal
external attack surface, which is positive, but the discrepancy
concerning a reported unencrypted web server demands immediate
clarification. Addressing the identified gaps through the recommended
actions will substantially enhance the organization’s overall
cybersecurity posture, reduce its exposure to common threats, and build
a more resilient defense against evolving cyber risks.</p>
