<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings from a cybersecurity posture
assessment conducted for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The
assessment involved reviewing organizational security controls via a
questionnaire, analyzing network scan data, and correlating these with
known vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Key findings indicate several critical gaps and high-severity
risks:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Outdated Web Server:</strong> An Nginx web server
(version 1.18.0) was identified, which is significantly outdated and
likely contains known vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>MFA Gaps:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is
not required for email access, posing a significant risk of account
compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Policy Deficiencies:</strong> The organization lacks an
Employee Acceptable Use Policy, which is crucial for defining expected
employee behavior regarding IT resources.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Training Deficiencies:</strong> Annual security awareness
training for all employees is not conducted, leaving the workforce
vulnerable to social engineering attacks and unaware of current
threats.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These issues collectively indicate a need for immediate attention to
strengthen the organization’s security posture. Detailed findings and
actionable recommendations are provided in the following sections.</p>

</div>
<h2 id="analysis-of-questionnaire-gaps">Analysis of Questionnaire
Gaps</h2>
<p>The questionnaire responses highlight the following critical security
gaps:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA for Email Access:</strong> The absence of MFA for
email access (Question 1) is a significant vulnerability. Email accounts
are primary targets for attackers and a successful compromise can lead
to further network penetration, data exfiltration, and business email
compromise (BEC) scams.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Employee Acceptable Use Policy:</strong> The lack of an
Employee Acceptable Use Policy (Question 4) means there are no formal
guidelines for employees on the proper use of organizational IT
resources. This increases the risk of misuse, data breaches, and
non-compliance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Annual Security Awareness Training:</strong> Not
conducting annual security awareness training for all employees
(Question 6) leaves the organization susceptible to evolving cyber
threats, phishing attacks, and social engineering tactics. Regular
training is essential to maintain a vigilant workforce.</p></li>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed to identify open ports, services, and
software versions running on the target system.</p>

</table>
</div>
<h2 id="technical-analysis">Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>The scan identified an Nginx web server running on version 1.18.0.
Nginx 1.18.0 was released in June 2020. As of the current date, this
version is significantly outdated. Modern Nginx stable versions are
typically in the 1.24.x or 1.26.x series. Running an outdated web server
product can expose the organization to numerous known vulnerabilities
(CVEs) that have been discovered and patched in newer versions. These
vulnerabilities could range from denial-of-service to remote code
execution, making this a high-severity technical risk.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following recommendations are provided to address the identified
risks and improve the overall cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="prioritized-recommendations">Prioritized Recommendations</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email
Access:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediately deploy and enforce MFA for
all user accounts accessing email services.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Significantly reduces the risk of email
account compromise, even if passwords are stolen, mitigating a critical
threat vector.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Update Nginx Web Server to a Supported
Version:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Plan and execute an upgrade of the Nginx
web server from version 1.18.0 to the latest stable and supported
release (e.g., 1.24.x or 1.26.x, depending on long-term support
considerations).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Patches known vulnerabilities, improves
performance, and ensures continued vendor support for security updates.
Prioritize testing in a non-production environment before deploying to
production.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Draft, approve, and disseminate a
comprehensive AUP that clearly defines appropriate use of organizational
IT assets, data, and internet access. Ensure all employees acknowledge
and understand the policy.</p></li>

for All Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop a program for mandatory annual
security awareness training for all employees, covering topics such as
phishing, social engineering, password hygiene, and data handling best
practices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Cultivates a security-aware culture,
empowers employees to identify and report threats, and significantly
reduces the human element risk in cybersecurity incidents.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>This assessment has identified critical areas requiring immediate
attention within <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>’s cybersecurity
posture. By addressing the outdated Nginx server, implementing MFA for
email, developing an Acceptable Use Policy, and rolling out annual
security awareness training, the organization can significantly reduce
its attack surface and strengthen its defenses against prevalent cyber
threats. Continuous monitoring and regular security assessments are also
recommended to maintain a robust security posture in an evolving threat
landscape.</p>
