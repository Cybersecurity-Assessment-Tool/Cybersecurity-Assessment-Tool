<h2 id="analysis-of-security-controls">Analysis of Security
Controls</h2>
<p>The questionnaire results highlight significant weaknesses in
critical security areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Gaps:</strong> While
MFA is required for email access, it is <strong>not universally enforced
across critical access points</strong>, specifically for computer logins
and sensitive data systems. This leaves these systems highly vulnerable
to credential stuffing, phishing, and brute-force attacks, potentially
leading to unauthorized access and data breaches.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of Security Awareness Training:</strong> A
substantial human element risk is identified due to the <strong>complete
absence of both new employee and annual security awareness
training</strong>. Employees are a common and effective target for
social engineering and phishing attacks, and without regular training,
they are ill-equipped to identify and report such evolving threats,
significantly increasing the organization’s attack surface.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed to identify any publicly
accessible services or vulnerabilities on the organization’s external
network.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> N/A</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Target Host:</strong> <code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="analysis-of-network-scan">Analysis of Network Scan</h2>
<p>The external network scan on <code>[Target IP]</code> identified no
open ports or services. This indicates a minimal external attack surface
from the perspective of publicly accessible services at the time of the
scan. While this is a positive finding, it’s crucial to understand that
this scan provides only a snapshot of the external posture and does not
diminish the significance of internal risks identified through policy
review.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the provided data, the following critical
risks have been identified. These are primarily derived from the
significant gaps highlighted in the organizational security control
questionnaire. No pre-existing vulnerabilities were provided in the
input data.</p>

<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Absence of New Employee Security
Training</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Critical Gap</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">New employees lack foundational knowledge
to identify and respond to cybersecurity threats, making them potential
weak links shortly after onboarding. This increases the risk of
successful social engineering attacks from day one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Absence of Annual Security Awareness
Training</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">High</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Without regular and updated security
awareness training, all employees are less likely to recognize evolving
threats such as advanced phishing, ransomware, and social engineering
tactics. This significantly increases the organization’s susceptibility
to breaches originating from human error or deception.</td>
