<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive assessment of the cybersecurity
posture for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on an
organizational security questionnaire and a network scan. The assessment
identified significant gaps in fundamental security controls, primarily
concerning multi-factor authentication (MFA) implementation and
foundational security policies. While the provided network scan data did
not identify any immediate open ports or services, the lack of crucial
internal security mechanisms presents a high-risk scenario.
Recommendations are provided to address these deficiencies and enhance
the overall security posture.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following organizational details were utilized during this
assessment. Please note that some information was not provided in the

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A review of the provided organizational security questionnaire
revealed several critical areas requiring immediate attention. The
responses indicate a lack of implementation for several industry best
practices related to identity and access management, and security
awareness.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was attempted against the specified target. Based on
the provided scan data, no open ports or services were identified on the
target . This could indicate a well-hardened external perimeter or that
the target was unreachable/unresponsive during the scan. It is crucial
to note that this assessment does not negate the internal security risks
identified via the questionnaire.</p>

</ul>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the security control questionnaire, several
high-severity risks have been identified. These risks pertain to
fundamental gaps in identity management and security policy, which are
critical for protecting organizational assets and data. No pre-existing
vulnerabilities were provided, nor were any specific technical
vulnerabilities identified through the network scan.</p>

<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of MFA for Email Access</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Email accounts are primary targets for
phishing and credential stuffing attacks. Without MFA, compromised

compromise, data exfiltration, and further network penetration.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of MFA for Computer Login</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Direct access to organizational computers
without MFA significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access
through stolen or weak credentials, enabling lateral movement and
malware deployment within the network.</td>

<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data
Systems</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Critical data systems storing sensitive

reputational damage.</td>

loss.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive
Data Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Prioritize critical systems storing or processing sensitive data
(e.g., HR, finance, customer databases) for MFA implementation.</p></li>
<li><p>Review access logs regularly to monitor MFA usage and identify
anomalies.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Draft a comprehensive AUP outlining the proper use of company IT
resources, internet, email, and data handling.</p></li>

hiring and periodically thereafter.</p></li>
<li><p>Communicate consequences for non-compliance.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Mandatory Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and deliver initial security awareness training as part
of the new employee onboarding process.</p></li>
<li><p>Topics should include phishing recognition, strong password
practices, physical security, and reporting security incidents.</p></li>
<li><p>Incorporate interactive elements and regular assessments to gauge
effectiveness.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Maintain and Enhance Annual Security Awareness
Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>While annual training is conducted, continuously update the
content to reflect current threat landscapes and organizational
changes.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider phishing simulation exercises to reinforce training and
measure employee vigilance.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The current cybersecurity posture of <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong> is significantly compromised by the absence of
foundational security controls, particularly multi-factor authentication
across critical access points and the lack of a comprehensive acceptable
use policy and initial security awareness training for new employees.
Addressing these gaps with the recommended actions will substantially
reduce the organization’s attack surface and improve its resilience
against common cyber threats. Continuous vigilance, regular policy
review, and ongoing employee education are paramount for maintaining a
strong security posture.</p>
