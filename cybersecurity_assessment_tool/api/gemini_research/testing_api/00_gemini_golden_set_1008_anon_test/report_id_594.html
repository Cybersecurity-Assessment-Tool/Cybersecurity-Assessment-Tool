<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings from an assessment of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>’s cybersecurity posture, based on
provided organizational data, network scan results, and pre-existing
risk information.</p>
<p>The assessment reveals a generally positive stance on multi-factor
authentication (MFA) and security awareness training, which are critical
foundational controls. However, a significant policy gap exists
concerning the absence of an Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). From
a technical standpoint, the provided network scan against
<code>[Target IP]</code> indicated no open ports, which is a strong
security finding for the scanned scope. A previously identified risk of
an "Unencrypted Web Server" (Port 80 open) appears to be mitigated
according to the current scan data, though verification is
recommended.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="key-findings">Key Findings</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Positive Security Controls:</strong> Robust
implementation of MFA across email, computer login, and sensitive data
systems. Consistent security awareness training programs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Critical Policy Gap:</strong> Absence of an Employee
Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), which is crucial for defining expected
employee behavior and mitigating various insider threats and
misuse.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Clean Network Scan (Scoped):</strong> The Nmap scan of
<code>[Target IP]</code> showed all typically enumerated ports as
closed, indicating no immediate external exposure on those specific
ports.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mitigated Known Risk:</strong> A previously identified
"Unencrypted Web Server" risk (Port 80 open) is no longer technically
visible based on the current scan.</p></li>

Recommendations</h2>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-security-control-gaps">Analysis
of Security Control Gaps</h2>
<p>The review highlights a critical gap: the absence of an employee
acceptable use policy. An AUP is fundamental for establishing
expectations for employees’ use of organizational assets, data, and
systems. Without it, the organization faces increased risks related
to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Misuse of company resources.</p></li>
<li><p>Data leakage or unauthorized access.</p></li>
<li><p>Legal and compliance issues.</p></li>
<li><p>Inconsistent disciplinary actions for security
violations.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The strong adoption of MFA and consistent security awareness training
are commendable strengths that should be maintained.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>This section details the findings from the network scan performed
using Nmap. The scan provides insights into the external services
exposed by the target system.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scanned Target:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not specified in input data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="summary-of-findings">Summary of Findings</h2>
<p>The Nmap scan against <code>[Target IP]</code> reported all typically
enumerated ports as <strong>closed</strong>. This is a positive security
finding, as it indicates that the target system is not exposing any
common services (such as HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, FTP, etc.) directly on these
ports to the internet within the scope of this scan.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="detailed-port-analysis">Detailed Port
Analysis</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 80 (HTTP):</strong> State:
<code>closed</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>No other open ports or services were identified by this specific
scan, meaning there are no active, visible network services running on
the standard ports that Nmap checked for on
<code>[Target IP]</code>.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="discrepancy-note">Discrepancy Note</h3>
<p>It is important to note a discrepancy with a pre-existing risk
("Unencrypted Web Server") which stated "Port 80 is open." The current
network scan explicitly shows Port 80 as <code>closed</code>. This
suggests that the risk has either been mitigated, or the previous
information was outdated. This positive change warrants verification to
ensure no other unencrypted web services exist on non-standard
ports.</p>

risks.</p>
<h2 id="high-priority-recommendations">High Priority
Recommendations</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Draft a comprehensive AUP outlining acceptable and unacceptable
use of company information systems, networks, and data.</p></li>
<li><p>Obtain legal review and formal approval for the AUP.</p></li>
<li><p>Communicate the AUP to all employees, ensuring understanding and
requiring acknowledgment of receipt.</p></li>
<li><p>Integrate AUP review into annual security awareness
training.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="medium-priority-recommendations">Medium Priority
Recommendations</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Verify Mitigation of "Unencrypted Web Server"
Risk:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Confirm that Port 80 is indeed intentionally closed and not just
filtered from the scan’s perspective.</p></li>
<li><p>Investigate if any other unencrypted web services are running on
non-standard ports.</p></li>
<li><p>If web services are required, ensure they are served over HTTPS
with valid SSL/TLS certificates.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Expand Scope of Network Scans:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Conduct more comprehensive scans (e.g., full port range,
different target IP ranges if applicable) to ensure no other unexpected
services are exposed.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement regular vulnerability scanning for all internet-facing
assets and internal networks.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="general-best-practices">General Best Practices</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Maintain Strong MFA Practices:</strong> Continue to
enforce MFA for all critical access points (email, computers, sensitive
systems). Regularly review MFA configurations and employee
enrollment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sustain Security Awareness Training:</strong> Continue
with regular and engaging security awareness training for all employees,
covering current threats and policy updates.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Policy Review:</strong> Establish a schedule for
regular review and update of all security policies and procedures to
ensure they remain relevant and effective against evolving
threats.</p></li>
