<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on an analysis of
organizational security controls, a targeted network scan, and an
assessment of pre-existing risks. The overall posture is moderate, with
several strong foundational controls in place, particularly concerning
security awareness and MFA for sensitive systems. However, a critical
gap has been identified regarding the absence of Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for computer logins, which represents a significant
risk. The network scan of the target <code>[Target IP]</code> showed the
host as active but found no open ports, suggesting a limited direct
external attack surface from the scanned perspective. No pre-existing
vulnerabilities were provided for this assessment.</p>
<p><strong>Key Findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Critical Risk:</strong> Lack of Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for computer logins.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Positive:</strong> Robust security awareness training
programs and acceptable use policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Positive:</strong> External network scan showed no open
ports on the target <code>[Target IP]</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Positive:</strong> MFA is utilized for email and
sensitive data systems.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Recommendation:</strong> Prioritize the implementation of
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins across the
organization to significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized
access.</p>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A review of the organization’s self-reported security controls

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on the designated target to identify
open ports, services, and potential vulnerabilities.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="open-ports-and-services">Open Ports and Services</h2>
<p>The Nmap scan of <code>[Target IP]</code> did not identify any open
ports. This indicates that from the perspective of the scanner, the host
does not have any network services directly exposed on commonly scanned
ports. This is a positive finding, suggesting a minimal direct external
attack surface.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following recommendations are provided to address the identified
risks and further enhance the organization’s cybersecurity posture.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer
Logins (High Priority)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Description:</strong> Mandate the use of Multi-Factor
Authentication for all user logins to organizational computers,
including workstations, servers, and remote access solutions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Significantly reduces the risk of
unauthorized access even if primary credentials (username and password)
are compromised through phishing, keylogging, or brute-force attacks.
Adds a crucial layer of security.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Actionable Steps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Research and select an MFA solution compatible with existing
identity management systems (e.g., Active Directory, Azure AD,
Okta).</p></li>
<li><p>Develop a phased rollout plan, starting with critical users or
departments, then expanding enterprise-wide.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide comprehensive training and support to employees on how to
use the new MFA system.</p></li>
<li><p>Establish clear policies for MFA enforcement and exception
handling.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Continue and Enhance Security Awareness
Training</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Description:</strong> Continue the existing regular
security awareness training programs for all employees, and consider
enhancing content to include emerging threats and the importance of
MFA.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Maintains and improves employee
vigilance, making them a stronger first line of defense against social
engineering and phishing attacks. Reinforces the importance of new
security measures like MFA.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Actionable Steps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Incorporate real-world examples of cyberattacks relevant to the
organization.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct periodic simulated phishing campaigns to test employee
responsiveness and identify areas for further training.</p></li>
<li><p>Include modules specifically on the importance and proper use of
MFA.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Regular Vulnerability Scanning and Penetration
Testing</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Description:</strong> Establish a schedule for regular
external and internal vulnerability scans and periodic penetration tests
of the network and critical systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Proactively identifies new
vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and outdated software that could be
exploited by attackers. Provides a more comprehensive view of the
security posture than point-in-time scans.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Actionable Steps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Define a scope and frequency for vulnerability scanning (e.g.,
quarterly for external, monthly for internal).</p></li>
<li><p>Engage third-party experts for annual penetration testing to
simulate real-world attacks.</p></li>
<li><p>Establish a robust remediation process for identified
vulnerabilities, including tracking and verification.</p></li>
</ul></li>
