</div>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="key-observations-from-questionnaire">Key
Observations from Questionnaire:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA Gaps:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is
not required for logging into computers. This represents a significant
risk, as compromised user credentials (e.g., from phishing attacks or
data breaches) could allow unauthorized access to internal systems,
bypassing a crucial layer of defense.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Training Deficiencies:</strong> There is a notable
absence of consistent security awareness training for both new and
existing employees. This lack of education increases the organization’s
susceptibility to common cyber threats such as phishing, social
engineering, and can lead to poor security hygiene among staff.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="sec:tech_scan">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was conducted against the target system, identified as
. The scan aimed to identify accessible services and potential entry
points.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong>
<code>[Scan Date - Not provided in input JSON]</code> <em>(Note:
Specific scan date was not available in the provided metadata for
Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON.)</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Target IP:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports and Services:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 3389 (TCP):</strong> Service ‘ms-wbt-server‘ (Remote
Desktop Protocol - RDP)</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Observation:</strong> The Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
service is openly accessible on the scanned target. RDP is a high-value
target for attackers, frequently exploited for initial access,
brute-force attacks, and leveraging known vulnerabilities to gain
unauthorized control over systems. No specific product or version
information was identified by the scanner for this service in the
provided output.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="sec:risk_assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes findings from the security control review
and technical scan with pre-existing vulnerability data to present a
holistic view of the organization’s risk posture. Critical findings are
correlated to provide a comprehensive understanding of potential
impacts.</p>
<h2 id="identified-pre-existing-risks">Identified Pre-existing
Risks</h2>

the organization (<em>Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON</em>):</p>

</div>
<h2 id="correlated-findings-and-gaps">Correlated Findings and Gaps</h2>
<p>Based on the comprehensive analysis, several critical risks and
security gaps have been identified by correlating information across all
inputs:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Critical Risk: Exposed RDP Service (Severity
9.0/Critical)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Source:</strong> Technical Scan Results (Port 3389 open)
directly corroborates the Pre-existing Risks data (Input 3 reports "RDP
Exposure" with Critical severity).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> The direct exposure of RDP significantly
broadens the attack surface for remote adversaries. This vulnerability
is highly susceptible to brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, and
exploitation of known RDP vulnerabilities, leading to unauthorized
access, ransomware deployment, and lateral movement within a compromised
network. The pre-existing risk indicates this is a known, high-priority
concern that remains unmitigated.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>High Risk: Lack of MFA for Computer Logins</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Source:</strong> Security Control Review (Questionnaire
Answer: "No" for MFA on computer logins).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> Without Multi-Factor Authentication,
compromised user credentials (e.g., obtained via phishing, malware, or
data breaches) can grant attackers direct and easy access to internal
systems, thereby bypassing a crucial layer of defense against
unauthorized entry and increasing the likelihood of successful
breaches.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>High Risk: Inadequate Security Awareness
Training</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Source:</strong> Security Control Review (Questionnaire
Answers: "No" for security awareness training for new employees and
annual training for all employees).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> A consistent lack of security awareness
training leaves employees as the weakest link in the security chain.
They become more susceptible to social engineering tactics, phishing
attacks, and may unknowingly engage in practices that compromise
organizational security. This significantly increases the risk of
accidental data breaches, malware infections, and policy violations,
undermining technical controls.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="sec:recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To effectively address the identified risks and significantly
strengthen the organization’s cybersecurity posture, the following
actionable recommendations are provided. These are categorized into
immediate actions for critical issues and long-term strategies for
sustained improvement.</p>
<h2 id="immediate-actions">Immediate Actions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Secure Exposed RDP Service:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Easy Fix:</strong> Immediately block all public inbound
access to Remote Desktop Protocol (Port 3389) at the firewall level for
(the scanned target). This is a critical first step to reduce immediate
exposure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Long-term Fix:</strong> Implement a Virtual Private
Network (VPN) solution with strong authentication (preferably MFA) as
the sole method for external remote access. RDP should only be
accessible internally or exclusively through the VPN.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure Network Level Authentication (NLA) is enforced for RDP
connections, and mandate strong, complex passwords for all RDP user
accounts.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Logins:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Prioritize the rapid deployment of Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) for all computer logins across the organization. This is a
critical control to mitigate the risk of credential theft and
unauthorized access, significantly raising the bar for
attackers.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Initiate Basic Security Awareness Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Immediately deploy a mandatory, foundational security awareness
training module for all employees. This training should cover essential
topics such as phishing recognition, password hygiene, identifying
suspicious emails, and the proper procedure for reporting potential
security incidents.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="long-term-strategies">Long-Term Strategies</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Comprehensive MFA Rollout:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Extend MFA requirements to all critical systems, applications,
and cloud services not yet protected, ensuring a consistent and robust
authentication posture across the entire IT ecosystem.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Sustained Security Awareness Program:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and implement a continuous, engaging security awareness
training program. This should include mandatory onboarding training for
all new hires, annual refresher courses for existing staff, and regular
simulated phishing exercises to gauge and improve employee resilience
against social engineering.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Vulnerability Management Program:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Establish and maintain a routine vulnerability scanning and patch
management program across all assets. This proactive approach will help
identify and remediate security weaknesses before they can be exploited
by attackers.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Principle of Least Privilege and Access Control
Reviews:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Conduct periodic reviews of user accounts, groups, and
permissions, ensuring that access rights are granted based on the
principle of least privilege and are aligned with current job roles and
responsibilities. Implement automated tools for access reviews where
possible.</p></li>
