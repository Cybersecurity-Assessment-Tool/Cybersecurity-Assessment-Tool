<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">1. Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides an assessment of the current cybersecurity
posture for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on a security
questionnaire, a targeted network scan, and an analysis of pre-existing
risks. The overall security posture reveals several critical gaps in
foundational security controls, notably concerning multi-factor
authentication (MFA) implementation for email and sensitive data
systems, and the absence of a formal employee acceptable use policy. The
network scan of the specified target revealed no open ports, which is a
positive finding indicating no immediate external network attack surface
from this scan. However, a pre-existing risk related to an unencrypted
web server was noted, which may require further investigation given
current scan results. Immediate action is recommended to address the
identified policy and control deficiencies to enhance the organization’s
resilience against cyber threats.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-questionnaire-gaps">3.1. Analysis
of Questionnaire Gaps</h2>
<p>The questionnaire highlights three significant areas of concern that
represent high risks to the organization:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Email Access:</strong> Without
multi-factor authentication, email accounts are highly susceptible to
compromise through phishing, brute-force attacks, or credential
stuffing. Compromised email accounts can lead to business email
compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and further network
intrusion.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong>
Protecting access to systems containing sensitive data is paramount. The
absence of MFA for these critical systems significantly increases the
risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and regulatory
non-compliance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> An AUP defines expected employee behavior regarding
company IT assets, data handling, and internet usage. Its absence can
lead to inconsistent security practices, increased insider risk, and
difficulties in enforcing security standards.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">4. Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was conducted on the target IP address
<code>[Target IP]</code> on 2026-01-26. The scan aimed to identify open
ports and services that could represent potential attack vectors.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> 2026-01-26</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Findings:</strong> The scan of revealed no open ports.
Specifically, port 80 was found to be in a <code>closed</code> state.
This indicates that, at the time of the scan, no immediately accessible
network services were detected on the scanned target.</p></li>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">6. Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the assessment, the following actionable recommendations are
provided to improve the cybersecurity posture of <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Access:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Mandate multi-factor authentication for all
email accounts across the organization, including administrative
accounts, using a robust MFA solution.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Significantly reduces the risk of email account
compromise, a leading cause of data breaches and business email
compromise incidents.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Enforce multi-factor authentication for all
access attempts to systems containing sensitive organizational or client
data, including databases, file shares, and critical
applications.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Provides an essential additional layer of
security, making it substantially harder for unauthorized users to gain
access to critical information assets.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Create a comprehensive AUP that clearly outlines
acceptable use of all company IT resources (hardware, software,
networks, data), data handling procedures, and security expectations.
This policy should be formally communicated to all employees, and signed
acknowledgments should be obtained.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Establishes clear boundaries and expectations
for employee behavior, reduces misuse of IT assets, minimizes insider
risk, and fosters a stronger security culture.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Review and Verify Unencrypted Web Server
Risk:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Investigate the status of any web servers
previously identified as unencrypted on Port 80 (as per the pre-existing
risk register). While the recent network scan indicated Port 80 is
currently closed, it is crucial to confirm if this server has been
properly decommissioned, secured with encryption (e.g., HTTPS), or if
the service is merely offline.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Ensures that potential historical
vulnerabilities are properly addressed and do not re-emerge, protecting
against unencrypted data transmission should the service become active
in the future.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">7. Conclusion</h1>
<p>The cybersecurity posture assessment for <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong> reveals a mixed security landscape. While the network
perimeter appears robust with no open ports detected by the recent scan,
critical internal security controls related to multi-factor
authentication and policy enforcement require immediate attention.
Addressing these foundational gaps will significantly enhance the
overall security posture and resilience against common cyber threats,
reinforcing the organization’s commitment to data protection and
operational integrity. Continued vigilance, coupled with the
implementation of the recommended security measures, is essential for
maintaining a strong and adaptive defense.</p>
