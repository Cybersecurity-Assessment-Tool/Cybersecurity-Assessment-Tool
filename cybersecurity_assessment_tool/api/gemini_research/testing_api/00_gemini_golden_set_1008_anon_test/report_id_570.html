<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides an assessment of the current cybersecurity
posture for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on a recent
network scan, a security questionnaire, and existing risk data.</p>
<p>The organization demonstrates good practices in some areas, such as
requiring Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data
systems, and conducting regular security awareness training.</p>
<p>However, critical gaps were identified, notably the lack of MFA for
computer logins and the absence of an employee acceptable use policy. A
technical scan of <code>[Target IP]</code> showed all identified ports
as closed. This finding directly contradicts a pre-existing risk entry
("Unencrypted Web Server") which states Port 80 is open. This
discrepancy requires immediate re-validation.</p>
<p>Overall, while foundational security elements are present, addressing
the identified gaps and clarifying the status of existing risks will
significantly enhance the organization’s security resilience and reduce
its overall risk exposure.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-questionnaire-gaps">Analysis of
Questionnaire Gaps</h2>
<p>The questionnaire responses reveal two significant security control
gaps that pose a notable risk to the organization:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer
Login:</strong> Not requiring MFA for logging into computers
significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access due to
compromised credentials, potentially leading to breaches of internal
systems and sensitive data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong>
Without a formal AUP, employees may be unaware of their responsibilities
regarding the appropriate use of organizational IT assets. This lack of
guidance can lead to potential misuse, data breaches, and non-compliance
with regulatory requirements.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed to identify open ports and services on
the target system.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Used:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Target:</strong> <code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> N/A (Using Report Date: 2026-01-26)
<em>(Note: Scan date was not provided in the input data.)</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> Up</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="detailed-port-scan-findings">Detailed Port
Scan Findings</h2>
<p>The scan of <code>[Target IP]</code> identified the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 80 (HTTP):</strong> State:
<code>closed</code></p></li>
</ul>
<p>All other commonly scanned ports were also found to be closed or
filtered. No open ports with identifiable services, products, or
versions were detected on the target asset during this scan.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="discrepancy-with-existing-risks">Discrepancy
with Existing Risks</h2>
<p>It is critical to note a direct contradiction between these current
scan results and an existing risk entry in the organization’s risk
register:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Existing Risk Name:</strong> "Unencrypted Web
Server"</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Existing Risk Overview:</strong> "Port 80 is
open."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Current Scan Finding:</strong> Port 80 is unequivocally
reported as <code>closed</code> on the target
<code>[Target IP]</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This discrepancy indicates that the "Unencrypted Web Server" risk may
either be mitigated, resolved, or pertains to a different asset not
covered by this scan. Further investigation is required to reconcile
this difference and ensure the accuracy of the risk register.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section consolidates the identified security gaps from the
questionnaire, the technical scan findings, and pre-existing
vulnerabilities into a comprehensive risk overview.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the comprehensive assessment, the following actionable
recommendations are provided to enhance the cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong> and mitigate identified risks.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer
Logins:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Deploy and enforce MFA for all employee
computer logins, particularly for endpoints accessing sensitive data or
internal networks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Significantly reduces the risk of
unauthorized access even if primary credentials (username and password)
are stolen or compromised, thereby enhancing identity and access
management.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Draft a comprehensive AUP outlining the
proper use of organizational IT resources, data handling procedures,
internet usage guidelines, and clear security responsibilities for all
employees.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Ensure all employees receive,
understand, and formally acknowledge the AUP, with mandatory annual
refreshers to reinforce its importance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Clarifies expectations, reduces insider
threats, minimizes accidental data exposure, strengthens legal
defensibility, and supports overall compliance efforts.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Re-validate "Unencrypted Web Server" Risk
Status:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Investigate the discrepancy regarding
the "Unencrypted Web Server" risk. Conduct further scans or manual
checks to confirm if Port 80 is indeed closed on the intended asset.
Identify the specific asset the original risk referred to.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> If Port 80 is confirmed closed on the
relevant asset, update or archive the risk accordingly. If the risk
pertains to a different asset, ensure the asset details are accurately
recorded in the risk register.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Maintains an accurate and current risk
register, ensuring that security resources are focused on active,
relevant threats and vulnerabilities.</p></li>
</ul></li>
