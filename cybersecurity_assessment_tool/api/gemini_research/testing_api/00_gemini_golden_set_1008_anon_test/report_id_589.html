<h1 class="unnumbered" id="introduction">1. Introduction</h1>
<p>This document presents an assessment of the current cybersecurity
posture of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The evaluation is based
on three primary data inputs: a network vulnerability scan, responses to
a security questionnaire, and a review of documented existing risks. The
objective is to identify vulnerabilities, highlight security control
deficiencies, and provide actionable recommendations to strengthen the
organization’s defenses against cyber threats.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">4. Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was conducted on on November 22, 2025. The scan
identified the following open ports and services:</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="open-ports-and-services">4.1 Open Ports and
Services</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 443 (HTTPS)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Service:</strong> HTTPS</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Product:</strong> Nginx</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.18.0</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Status:</strong> Open</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="technical-analysis">4.2 Technical
Analysis</h2>
<p>The scan revealed one open port running the Nginx web server. The
detected version, <code>Nginx 1.18.0</code>, is significantly outdated.
As of the time of this report, much newer stable versions (e.g., Nginx
1.24.x or 1.26.x) are available. Running outdated software can expose
the system to a multitude of known vulnerabilities that have been
patched in newer releases, potentially leading to various security
exploits including remote code execution, denial of service, or
information disclosure.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment">5. Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the security questionnaire and technical
scan results, the following risks have been identified. No pre-existing
vulnerabilities were provided for this assessment.</p>

<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of MFA for Email</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Without Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
for email access, an attacker who compromises user credentials could
gain full access to email accounts, potentially leading to phishing,
business email compromise, and unauthorized data access.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Absence of Acceptable Use Policy</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Without a clear Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP), employees may be unaware of their responsibilities regarding IT
asset usage, increasing the risk of misuse, data breaches, and
non-compliance with legal/regulatory requirements.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Insufficient Annual Security Training</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of regular, annual security awareness

sophisticated phishing, social engineering, and malware, making them
potential weak links in the organization’s defenses.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Outdated Nginx Web Server</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The Nginx web server version 1.18.0 is
significantly outdated. This version may contain known vulnerabilities
that have been patched in newer releases, making the service susceptible
to various attacks, including remote code execution or denial of
service.</td>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">6. Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and enhance the overall
cybersecurity posture, the following recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Access:</strong> Mandate
Multi-Factor Authentication for all email accounts. This is a critical
control to prevent unauthorized access even if primary credentials are
compromised.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a comprehensive AUP that clearly outlines
employee responsibilities for using organizational IT assets, data, and
internet resources. Ensure all employees are trained on the AUP and
formally acknowledge their understanding and compliance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Annual Security Awareness Training:</strong>
Implement a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all
employees. This training should cover current threats such as phishing,
social engineering, password hygiene, and the importance of reporting
suspicious activities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Update Nginx Web Server:</strong> Immediately update the
Nginx web server to the latest stable version. This will patch known
vulnerabilities, improve security features, and ensure the web server
benefits from ongoing security enhancements.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement a Robust Patch Management Program:</strong>
Establish a systematic process for regularly identifying, testing, and
applying security patches and updates to all operating systems,
applications, and network devices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Regular Vulnerability Scanning and Penetration
Testing:</strong> Schedule regular vulnerability scans and periodic
penetration tests against internal and external assets to proactively
identify and address security weaknesses before they can be exploited by
attackers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Security Reviews:</strong> Conduct periodic
reviews of all implemented security controls and configurations to
ensure they remain effective and aligned with evolving threats and best
practices.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">7. Conclusion</h1>
<p>The assessment reveals that while some critical security controls are
in place (e.g., MFA for sensitive systems), there are significant gaps,
particularly regarding email MFA, formal policies, recurring security
training, and software patching. Addressing the identified risks and
implementing the recommendations outlined in this report will
substantially improve <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>’s defense
against common cyber threats and enhance its overall security
posture.</p>
