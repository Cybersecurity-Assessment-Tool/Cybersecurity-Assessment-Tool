<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture assessment for
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on an analysis of network
scan data, organizational security questionnaire responses, and the
absence of pre-existing risk information. The assessment reveals several
critical areas for improvement, particularly significant gaps in
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) implementation, the absence of an
Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), and the use of outdated,
vulnerable software (Nginx 1.18.0) on publicly exposed services.
Addressing these findings is crucial for enhancing the organization’s
overall security resilience against modern cyber threats.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="technical-findings">Technical Findings</h2>
<p>The Nmap scan reveals an Nginx web server running on port 443 (HTTPS)
with version <code>1.18.0</code>. Nginx 1.18.0 was released in April
2020 and has since reached End-of-Life (EOL). This version is
significantly outdated and is highly likely to contain known
vulnerabilities that have been patched in newer releases. Running EOL
software exposes the organization to known exploits and significantly
increases the risk of compromise for the web server and potentially the
underlying system.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section correlates findings from the security questionnaire and
technical scans to identify and assess key cybersecurity risks. No
pre-existing vulnerabilities were provided in Input_3.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and significantly enhance the
overall cybersecurity posture, the following actionable recommendations
are provided:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Access:</strong> Mandate
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all employee email accounts. This
provides a crucial additional layer of security, making it significantly
harder for attackers to gain unauthorized access even if primary
credentials are stolen.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Logins:</strong> Deploy MFA
for all user logins to company computers, laptops, and internal systems.
This strengthens endpoint security and protects against credential-based
attacks targeting internal resources.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a comprehensive Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) that
clearly defines employee responsibilities, acceptable use of company IT
resources, internet usage guidelines, and data handling procedures.
Ensure all employees are trained on and formally acknowledge this
policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Update Nginx Web Server:</strong> Immediately upgrade the
Nginx web server (currently version 1.18.0) to the latest stable version
(e.g., 1.26.x) or the latest Long Term Support (LTS) release (e.g.,
1.24.x). Establish a robust patch management process for all
internet-facing services to ensure software remains up-to-date and
protected against known vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Vulnerability Scanning and Penetration
Testing:</strong> Implement a schedule for regular external and internal
vulnerability scanning, complemented by periodic penetration testing, to
proactively identify and address security weaknesses before they can be
exploited.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ongoing Security Awareness Training:</strong> Continue
and expand security awareness training to cover topics like advanced
phishing tactics, social engineering, secure remote work practices, and
the importance of reporting suspicious activities.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The current cybersecurity posture of <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong> requires immediate attention, particularly regarding
foundational security controls like Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
across critical access points and the implementation of an Acceptable
Use Policy (AUP). Furthermore, the presence of an outdated and
vulnerable Nginx web server represents a significant technical risk. By
systematically addressing the identified risks and diligently
implementing the recommended controls, <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong> can significantly strengthen its defenses against common
cyber threats, reduce its attack surface, and build a more resilient
security environment.</p>
