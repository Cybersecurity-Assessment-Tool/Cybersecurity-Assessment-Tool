<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a cybersecurity posture assessment based on a
security questionnaire. The assessment identifies critical security gaps
related to Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer
logins. While other foundational controls such as acceptable use
policies and security awareness training are in place, the absence of
MFA in these key areas significantly elevates the organization’s risk
profile, making it highly susceptible to credential-based attacks.</p>
<p>No network scan data or pre-existing vulnerability information was
provided for this assessment, which limits the scope of technical
analysis. Therefore, the findings primarily highlight crucial policy and
control deficiencies. Immediate implementation of MFA for all access
points, particularly email and computer logins, is strongly recommended
to drastically improve the security posture.</p>

Results</h1>
<p>No network scan data was provided for this assessment
(Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON contained an empty ‘scans‘ array and
‘target‘). Therefore, no technical vulnerabilities, open ports, service
versions, or misconfigurations could be identified or reported through
an active scan. This significantly limits the ability to provide a
comprehensive technical risk assessment.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment">4. Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>The primary risks identified in this assessment stem from the
critical gaps highlighted in the security control review. No
pre-existing vulnerabilities or risks were provided as part of the input
data for this assessment (Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON contained an empty
‘vulnerabilities‘ array).</p>

<td style="text-align: left;">Without Multi-Factor Authentication for
email access, accounts are highly vulnerable to credential stuffing,
phishing, and brute-force attacks. Compromised email accounts can lead
to business email compromise (BEC), data exfiltration, and further
network penetration, posing a severe threat to the organization’s
integrity and financial stability.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;">Failure to implement MFA for computer
logins significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to

attacker direct access to internal systems, potentially leading to
privilege escalation, lateral movement, and direct access to sensitive
data or critical infrastructure.</td>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">5. Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis, the following actionable recommendations are
provided to enhance the organization’s cybersecurity posture:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Universally:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Email Access:</strong> Immediately implement and enforce
MFA for all email accounts, including administrative and user accounts.
This is a foundational control against phishing and credential
theft.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Computer Logins:</strong> Implement MFA for all computer
logins, especially for administrative accounts, privileged users, and
systems processing sensitive data. This adds a crucial layer of security
beyond passwords.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Regular and Comprehensive Network
Scans:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Initiate regular vulnerability scans and penetration tests on all
external-facing and internal assets. This will identify technical
vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, outdated software, and potential
entry points that were not assessable in this report due to lack of
data.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure scans cover a broad range of assets, including servers,
workstations, network devices, and web applications.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish and Maintain a Robust Risk
Register:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and maintain a comprehensive risk register to track,
assess, and prioritize all identified vulnerabilities and risks (both
technical and policy-based).</p></li>
<li><p>Implement a clear process for risk treatment, including
mitigation, acceptance, transfer, or avoidance, along with defined
timelines and ownership for remediation tasks.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Review and Enhance Security Policies and
Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>While policies and training are in place, ensure they are
regularly reviewed and updated to reflect current threats and best
practices, specifically emphasizing the importance and proper use of
MFA.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct periodic simulated phishing campaigns to test employee
vigilance and reinforce security awareness training.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Implementing these recommendations will significantly strengthen the
organization’s defenses against common cyber threats and build a more
resilient security posture.</p>
