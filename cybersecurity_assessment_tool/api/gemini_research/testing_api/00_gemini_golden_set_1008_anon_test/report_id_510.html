<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity assessment based
on an analysis of network scan data, organizational security
questionnaire responses, and pre-existing risk information. The
objective is to identify critical security gaps, technical
vulnerabilities, and provide actionable recommendations to enhance the
overall security posture.</p>
<p>Key findings indicate a proactive approach in some areas, such as
requiring Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and
sensitive data systems, and conducting annual security awareness
training. However, critical gaps were identified, notably the lack of
MFA for email access and the absence of security awareness training for
new employees, significantly increasing exposure to phishing and social
engineering attacks.</p>
<p>The conducted network scan revealed no open ports on the target
<code>[Target IP]</code>, suggesting a well-hardened external perimeter
or that the scanned target does not host publicly accessible services on
standard ports. A pre-existing risk concerning an "Unencrypted Web
Server" (Port 80 open) was noted, but the Nmap scan results contradict
this, showing Port 80 as closed. This suggests the risk may be mitigated
or requires further investigation to verify its applicability to the
scanned target.</p>
<p>Prioritizing the implementation of MFA for email and mandatory
security training for new hires are immediate recommendations to address
the most pressing human-centric vulnerabilities.</p>

<h2 id="nmap-scan-summary">Nmap Scan Summary</h2>
<p>A network scan was conducted to identify open ports and services on
the designated target.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target Scanned:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not available in scan
metadata.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Used:</strong> nmap</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Findings:</strong> The Nmap scan conducted against the target
<code>[Target IP]</code> indicated no open ports. All common ports,
including port 80, were reported as <code>closed</code>. This suggests a
tightly controlled network perimeter, or that the scanned target is not
hosting publicly accessible services on standard ports. No services,
products, or versions could be identified due to the lack of open
ports.</p>

<td style="text-align: left;">Without Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
on email accounts, the organization is highly susceptible to phishing
attacks and credential stuffing, leading to unauthorized access to
sensitive communications and potential further network compromise.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of Security Awareness Training for
New Employees</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">New employees are often a primary target
for social engineering attacks due to their unfamiliarity with
organizational security policies and common threat vectors. This gap
increases the risk of successful phishing, malware, or social
engineering incidents.</td>

<strong>Note:</strong> The Nmap scan indicates Port 80 is
<code>CLOSED</code> on the target <code>[Target IP]</code>. This risk
may be a false positive or mitigated for the scanned target if the scan
accurately reflects the current state. However, if this service exists
internally or on another IP not scanned, the use of unencrypted HTTP
remains a vulnerability.</td>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and enhance the organization’s
overall cybersecurity posture, the following recommendations are
provided.</p>
<h2 id="immediate-actions">Immediate Actions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Access:</strong> Mandate
Multi-Factor Authentication for all email accounts across the
organization. This is a critical control against credential theft and
unauthorized access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mandatory Security Awareness Training for New
Hires:</strong> Develop and implement a mandatory security awareness
training program for all new employees during their onboarding process.
This training should cover phishing, social engineering, password
hygiene, and data handling best practices.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="short-term-actions">Short-Term Actions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Verify "Unencrypted Web Server" Risk Status:</strong>
Investigate the status of the "Unencrypted Web Server" risk. If Port 80
is indeed closed on all external-facing assets as per the Nmap scan,
this risk can be marked as mitigated or a false positive. If the service
exists on internal networks or other external IPs, ensure it is either
secured with HTTPS/TLS or decommissioned.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="long-term-strategies">Long-Term Strategies</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Regular Security Awareness Training Refreshers:</strong>
Continue and enhance the annual security awareness training for all
employees, ensuring content is updated to reflect current threat
landscapes and organizational policies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Periodic Vulnerability Assessments:</strong> Implement a
schedule for regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing of
both external and internal network assets to proactively identify and
address potential weaknesses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Review and Update Security Policies:</strong>
Periodically review and update existing security policies, including the
acceptable use policy, to ensure they remain relevant and effective
against evolving cyber threats.</p></li>
