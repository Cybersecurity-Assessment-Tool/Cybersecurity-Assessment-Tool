<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings from a cybersecurity posture
assessment conducted for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The
assessment involved reviewing existing security controls based on a
questionnaire, analyzing network scan data, and correlating these with
known organizational risks.</p>
<p>Key findings indicate several critical security gaps:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Critical Database Exposure:</strong> An exposed MySQL
database running an End-of-Life (EOL) version (5.7.33) was identified,
posing a significant risk of data breach and system compromise. This
directly correlates with a pre-existing "Database Exposure" risk,
amplified by the EOL status.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>MFA Gaps:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is
not universally enforced, specifically for email access and sensitive
data systems, leaving critical accounts vulnerable to credential
stuffing and phishing attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inadequate Security Awareness Training:</strong> A lack
of initial security awareness training for new employees increases the
organization’s susceptibility to social engineering and phishing
attacks, potentially leading to initial access for threat
actors.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These issues collectively expose the organization to a high risk of
cyberattack, data loss, and operational disruption. Immediate and
strategic recommendations are provided to mitigate these vulnerabilities
and enhance the overall security posture.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-security-control-gaps">Analysis of Security Control
Gaps</h2>
<p>The questionnaire highlights several critical areas where security
controls are lacking or inconsistently applied:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA for Email Access:</strong> The absence of MFA for
email access is a significant vulnerability. Email accounts are often
targets for phishing and business email compromise (BEC) attacks.
Without MFA, compromised credentials can lead to unauthorized access to
sensitive communications and systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> Similar to
email, not requiring MFA for access to sensitive data systems leaves
these critical assets exposed. A single compromised password could grant
an attacker access to valuable or regulated data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Security Awareness Training for New Employees:</strong>
While annual training is conducted, the lack of initial training for new
employees means they may not be adequately prepared to identify and
respond to common cyber threats from day one, increasing the risk of
human error-induced security incidents.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>

</div>
<h2 id="technical-analysis">Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>The presence of an open MySQL port (3306) is a significant concern,
especially given the identified version.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Exposed MySQL Database (Port 3306):</strong> The MySQL
database service is exposed to the network. If not properly secured with
strong authentication, network access controls, and encryption, this can
lead to unauthorized database access, data exfiltration, or
denial-of-service.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>End-of-Life (EOL) Software:</strong> MySQL version 5.7.33
reached its End of Life (EOL) for community support in October 2023.
This means that this version no longer receives security patches, bug
fixes, or technical support from the vendor. Running EOL software
significantly increases the risk profile as any newly discovered
vulnerabilities will not be addressed, leaving the system permanently
exposed to known and unknown exploits.</p></li>

<h2 id="detailed-risk-descriptions">Detailed Risk Descriptions</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>EOL MySQL Database Exposure</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Overview:</em> The organization’s MySQL database, identified
as version 5.7.33, is directly accessible via port 3306 and has reached
its End-of-Life (EOL) status. This means it no longer receives security
patches, making it highly susceptible to known vulnerabilities. This
amplifies the pre-existing "Database Exposure" risk (Input 3, severity
7.5 CVSSv3 base score).</p></li>
<li><p><em>Impact:</em> Data breach, unauthorized data modification,
denial-of-service, complete system compromise. High potential for
regulatory fines and severe reputational damage.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Severity:</em> Critical</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Email Access</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Overview:</em> Multi-Factor Authentication is not required
for accessing email accounts. Email is a primary vector for phishing and
credential harvesting attacks, making accounts vulnerable to
single-factor authentication bypass.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Impact:</em> Compromised email accounts can lead to Business
Email Compromise (BEC), sensitive data exposure, unauthorized access to
other linked services, and impersonation of employees.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Severity:</em> High</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Overview:</em> MFA is not mandated for logging into systems
containing sensitive data. This significantly increases the risk of
unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or guessed.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Impact:</em> Unauthorized access to sensitive, proprietary,
or regulated data. Potential for data breaches, compliance violations,
and significant financial and reputational damage.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Severity:</em> High</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Inadequate Security Awareness Training for New
Employees</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Overview:</em> While annual security awareness training is
conducted, new employees do not receive initial training upon joining.
This leaves them vulnerable during a critical period when they are
learning new systems and processes.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Impact:</em> Increased susceptibility to social engineering,
phishing, and malware attacks, potentially leading to initial compromise
of the organization’s network through human error.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Severity:</em> Medium</p></li>
