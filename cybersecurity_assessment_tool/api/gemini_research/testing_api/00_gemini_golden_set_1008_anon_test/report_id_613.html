<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong> based on a review of provided
organizational data, a technical network scan, and an assessment of
existing risks. The overall security posture reveals several commendable
practices, particularly regarding Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
sensitive systems and email, alongside robust security awareness
training programs. However, a critical gap was identified concerning the
lack of MFA enforcement for computer logins, significantly increasing
the risk of unauthorized access through compromised credentials.
Additionally, the network scan revealed the presence of a potentially
outdated web server (Nginx 1.18.0), which could expose the organization
to known vulnerabilities if not properly patched or updated.
Recommendations are provided to address these identified areas for
improvement.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-questionnaire-results">Analysis of Questionnaire
Results</h2>
<p>The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to several key
security practices, including the use of MFA for email and sensitive
data systems, as well as comprehensive security awareness training and
an acceptable use policy. However, the absence of MFA enforcement for
computer logins represents a significant security vulnerability that
warrants immediate attention.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on <code>[Target IP]</code> on
2025-11-22T10:00:00Z. The scan identified the following open ports and
services:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> 2025-11-22T10:00:00Z</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Target Host:</strong> <code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Detected Services:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 443/TCP (Open):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Service Name:</strong> HTTPS</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Product:</strong> Nginx</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.18.0</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of Technical
Findings</h2>
<p>The scan identified an Nginx web server running version 1.18.0 on
port 443 (HTTPS). Nginx 1.18.0 was released in 2020 and is from an older
stable branch that is no longer actively maintained by the Nginx
project. While not necessarily immediately exploitable without further
context, running unsupported software versions carries inherent risks,
as new vulnerabilities may be discovered for which no patches will be
released. It is generally recommended to use actively supported and
patched versions to mitigate security risks.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of organizational data, technical scan results,
and current risk information, the following risks have been
identified:</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To enhance the overall cybersecurity posture of <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong>, the following recommendations are provided:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Logins (High
Priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all user logins to
computers and workstations. This adds a critical layer of security,
making it significantly harder for attackers to gain access even if they
compromise user credentials.</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluate suitable MFA solutions compatible with the
organization’s existing identity and access management (IAM)
infrastructure.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Update Web Server Software (Medium
Priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Plan and execute an upgrade of the Nginx web server from version
1.18.0 to a currently supported and stable release (e.g., the latest
stable branch like 1.24.x or the latest mainline like 1.26.x, as of this
writing).</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure proper testing is conducted in a staging environment
before deploying the update to production to prevent service
disruptions.</p></li>
<li><p>Regularly review and update all software components to benefit
from security patches and performance improvements.</p></li>
</ul></li>
