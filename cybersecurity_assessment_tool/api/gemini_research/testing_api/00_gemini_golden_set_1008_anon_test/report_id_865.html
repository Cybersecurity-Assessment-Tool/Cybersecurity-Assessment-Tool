<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on an analysis of
network scan data, a security questionnaire, and existing risk
information. The assessment aims to identify key strengths, critical
gaps, and actionable recommendations to enhance the organization’s
security posture.</p>
<p>Overall, the organization presents a <strong>Moderate Risk</strong>
posture. While strong controls like Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
are in place for critical systems, significant vulnerabilities exist
regarding web server software and foundational security policies and
training. Specifically, an outdated Nginx web server introduces
technical risk, and the absence of an acceptable use policy combined
with insufficient annual security awareness training creates substantial
human factor risks and governance gaps. Addressing these areas is
crucial for improving the overall security baseline.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following information pertains to the client organization during
this assessment. Please note that some details were not provided and are

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-security-control-gaps">Analysis
of Security Control Gaps</h2>
<p>The questionnaire highlights two critical areas requiring immediate
attention:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Absence of an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP)</strong>: This is a fundamental governance gap. Without an AUP,
employees lack clear guidelines on the responsible and secure use of
organizational IT assets, increasing the risk of misuse, data breaches,
and non-compliance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Annual Security Awareness Training</strong>:
While new employees receive training, the absence of recurring annual
training for all staff means the workforce may not be up-to-date on
evolving threats and best practices. This significantly elevates the
risk of successful social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) and other
human-factor vulnerabilities.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was conducted to identify open ports and services,
providing insight into the organization’s external attack surface.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="open-ports-and-services">Open Ports and

</div>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="technical-analysis">Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>The scan identified one open port (443) running an Nginx web
server.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Nginx Version 1.18.0</strong>: This version of Nginx is
significantly outdated. The 1.18.x branch reached its end-of-life in
April 2021. Running outdated software is a critical vulnerability as it
likely contains known security flaws that have been patched in newer
versions. Attackers can exploit these known vulnerabilities to gain
unauthorized access, disrupt service, or compromise data. Upgrading to a
currently supported and patched version is strongly
recommended.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the combined analysis of the security questionnaire,
technical scan results, and any pre-existing vulnerability data (none
provided in this instance), the following risks have been
identified:</p>

1.18.0)</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Nginx version 1.18.0 is significantly
outdated and no longer receives security updates. This poses a high risk
of exploitation through known vulnerabilities, potentially leading to
web server compromise, data breaches, or denial of service.</td>

requirements due to a lack of clear employee guidelines.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">High</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Insufficient Annual Security Awareness
Training</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">While new employees are trained, the lack
of mandatory annual security awareness training for all staff increases
susceptibility to evolving cyber threats like phishing, social
engineering, and poor security hygiene among employees.</td>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and improve the overall
cybersecurity posture, the following recommendations are provided:</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="immediate-actions-high-priority">Immediate
Actions (High Priority)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade Nginx Web Server</strong>: Immediately plan and
execute an upgrade of the Nginx web server to the latest stable and
supported version (e.g., Nginx 1.24.x or 1.26.x). Ensure thorough
testing of applications after the upgrade.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP)</strong>: Create a clear, comprehensive AUP that outlines
acceptable and unacceptable use of all organizational IT resources.
Distribute it to all employees, obtain signed acknowledgments, and
integrate it into onboarding and annual training.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Annual Security Awareness Training</strong>:
Establish a mandatory annual security awareness training program for all
employees. This training should cover current threats (e.g., phishing,
ransomware), data handling best practices, password hygiene, and the
organization’s security policies.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="general-best-practices-ongoing">General Best
Practices (Ongoing)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Regular Vulnerability Scanning</strong>: Implement a
schedule for regular internal and external vulnerability scanning to
continuously identify and remediate security weaknesses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Patch Management Program</strong>: Establish a robust
patch management program to ensure all operating systems, applications,
and network devices are kept up-to-date with the latest security
patches.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Incident Response Plan Development</strong>: If not
already in place, develop and regularly test an incident response plan
to ensure the organization can effectively detect, respond to, and
recover from cybersecurity incidents.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Policy Review</strong>: Periodically review and
update all security policies and procedures (including the AUP) to
ensure they remain relevant and effective against the evolving threat
landscape.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>While <strong>[Organization Name]</strong> demonstrates a good
foundation with MFA implemented across key access points, the identified
gaps in software currency, security governance (AUP), and ongoing
employee education present significant attack vectors. Proactively
addressing these high-priority risks will substantially strengthen the
organization’s defense against cyber threats and foster a more secure
operational environment. Continuous vigilance and adherence to security
best practices are essential for maintaining a strong cybersecurity
posture.</p>
