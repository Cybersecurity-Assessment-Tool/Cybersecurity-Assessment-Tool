<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on an analysis of
network scan results, organizational security controls, and existing
risk data. The assessment identifies critical security gaps, technical
vulnerabilities, and highlights areas requiring immediate attention to
strengthen the organization’s overall security stance. Key findings
include a lack of multi-factor authentication for email access, the
absence of a formal acceptable use policy, and the presence of an
outdated FTP service allowing anonymous access. These issues, combined
with pre-existing risks such as outdated operating systems,
significantly elevate the organization’s risk profile and expose it to
potential data breaches, unauthorized access, and operational
disruption. Proactive and strategic remediation efforts are strongly
recommended to mitigate these identified threats.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-questionnaire-findings">Analysis
of Questionnaire Findings</h2>
<p>Two critical security gaps were identified from the questionnaire
responses that require immediate attention:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Email Access:</strong> The absence of
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email significantly increases the
risk of account compromise through phishing, credential stuffing, or
brute-force attacks. Email accounts are often a primary gateway to other
organizational systems and contain vast amounts of sensitive
information.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> Without
a formal AUP, employees lack clear guidelines regarding appropriate use
of organizational assets, data handling, and internet usage. This can
lead to increased legal liabilities, data breaches due to misuse or
negligence, and a generally insecure computing environment lacking
fundamental user accountability.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed targeting . The following open ports and
services were identified:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 21/TCP (FTP)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Service:</strong> FTP
(<code>vsftpd 2.3.4</code>)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Product/Version Information:</strong> The ‘vsftpd‘
service version <code>2.3.4</code> is significantly outdated. This
version, released in 2011, is known to contain critical vulnerabilities,
most notably a backdoor vulnerability (CVE-2011-2523) that could allow
remote code execution if specific conditions are met (e.g., if the
vulnerable version was compiled with a specific backdoor
present).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Key Finding:</strong> The service explicitly allows
<strong>Anonymous FTP login</strong>. This means unauthenticated users
can connect to the FTP server, potentially viewing, uploading, or
downloading files without any credentials. This poses a severe risk of
data exposure, unauthorized data injection, or even full system
compromise, depending on the server’s configuration and accessible
directories.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of
Technical Findings</h2>
<p>The presence of an outdated FTP server (‘vsftpd 2.3.4‘) with
anonymous access enabled is a critical vulnerability. This allows
external actors to interact with the server without any authentication.
This, combined with the known age and potential critical vulnerabilities
of this specific version, represents a significant entry point for
attackers to gain unauthorized access, exfiltrate sensitive data, or
compromise the host system, potentially leading to further internal
network access.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section consolidates risks identified from the security
questionnaire, technical network scan, and pre-existing organizational
risks (Input 3). Severity is assessed on a scale reflecting potential
impact and likelihood, aligned with common industry classifications: Low
(0.1-3.9), Medium (4.0-6.9), High (7.0-8.9), and Critical (9.0-10.0),
based on CVSS v3.x base scores where applicable.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following recommendations are provided to address the identified
risks and improve the overall cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. These actions are categorized by
urgency and scope.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="immediate-actions-critical-high-risks">Immediate Actions (Critical
&amp; High Risks)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
Email:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Immediately enable and enforce MFA for all organizational email
accounts. This should be a top priority to protect against
credential-based attacks, which are a common initial compromise
vector.</p></li>
<li><p>Review and enforce strong password policies across all user
accounts.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Decommission / Secure FTP Service:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Urgent:</strong> Disable anonymous FTP access on the
system at (Port 21). Review and restrict all FTP access to only
absolutely necessary, authenticated users.</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluate the necessity of running an FTP service. If it is not
critical for business operations, it should be decommissioned entirely
to eliminate the attack surface.</p></li>
<li><p>If FTP functionality is required, upgrade <code>vsftpd</code> to
the latest stable and supported version, or replace FTP with a more
secure file transfer protocol such as SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol)
or a managed file transfer solution that supports encryption and strong
authentication.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure any required file transfers are encrypted in transit and
at rest.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Draft and formally approve a comprehensive AUP that clearly
outlines employee responsibilities for technology usage, data handling,
internet usage, and security best practices.</p></li>
<li><p>Distribute the AUP to all employees and obtain their
acknowledgement of understanding and compliance. Integrate AUP review
and refresher training into annual security awareness programs.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="longer-term-actions-medium-risks-strategic-improvements">Longer-Term
Actions (Medium Risks &amp; Strategic Improvements)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade Outdated Windows Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop a phased plan to upgrade all Windows 7 machines to a
currently supported operating system (e.g., Windows 10/11). Prioritize
machines handling sensitive data or those with direct network
exposure.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement a robust patch management system to ensure all
operating systems and applications are kept up-to-date with the latest
security patches and configurations.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Vulnerability Scanning and Penetration
Testing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement a schedule for regular internal and external
vulnerability scans to proactively identify new weaknesses and
misconfigurations.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct periodic penetration tests by independent third parties
to simulate real-world attacks and validate the effectiveness of
existing security controls.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Incident Response Plan Review and Testing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ensure an up-to-date Incident Response Plan (IRP) is in place,
regularly reviewed, and tested through tabletop exercises or
simulations.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide training to relevant personnel on their roles and
responsibilities during a security incident.</p></li>
