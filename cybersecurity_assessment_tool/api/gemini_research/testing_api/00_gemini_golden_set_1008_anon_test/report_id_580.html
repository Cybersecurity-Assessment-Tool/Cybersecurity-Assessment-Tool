<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The assessment
involved a review of organizational security controls via a
questionnaire and an external network scan of <code>[Client IP]</code>.
Key findings indicate a positive stance on security awareness and
acceptable use policies. However, a critical gap was identified
regarding the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer
login, posing a significant risk of unauthorized access. The external
network scan of <code>[Target IP]</code> did not reveal any open ports,
which is a positive indicator for external attack surface management.
This report outlines the identified risks and provides actionable
recommendations to enhance the overall security posture.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-questionnaire-findings">Analysis of Questionnaire
Findings</h2>
<p>The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to several
foundational security practices, including the use of MFA for email and
sensitive data systems, an acceptable use policy, and regular security
awareness training. This indicates a good baseline for employee
education and access control for critical resources.</p>
<p>However, a significant weakness was identified in the absence of MFA
for logging into computers (Q2). This is a critical gap as it leaves
internal systems vulnerable to credential stuffing, brute-force attacks,
or compromises via phishing if only a single factor (password) is
required for access. This represents a high risk for unauthorized
internal access.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results-external-network-scan">Technical Scan
Results: External Network Scan</h1>
<h2 id="scan-metadata">Scan Metadata</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> N/A (Scan metadata did not include a
specific date.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address(es):</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Used:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="detailed-findings">Detailed Findings</h2>
<p>The Nmap scan performed on reported that the host was ‘up‘ but did
not identify any open ports. All extra ports were reported as
‘closed‘.</p>
<h3 id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of Technical
Findings</h3>
<p>The absence of open ports on the external target is a positive
finding. This indicates a minimal external attack surface, suggesting
that the organization’s network perimeter is well-secured against common
external enumeration and direct exploitation attempts. It’s crucial to
note that this scan provides a snapshot of external exposure; internal
network posture and web application security (if applicable) would
require further assessment.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the questionnaire and the technical scan,
the following risks have been identified:</p>
<div id="tab:risks">
<table>
<caption>Identified Risks</caption>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align: left;"><strong>Risk Name</strong></th>
<th style="text-align: left;"><strong>Overview</strong></th>
<th style="text-align: left;"><strong>Severity</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of MFA for Computer Login</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The organization does not require
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for logging into computers. This
significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access to internal
systems if user credentials are compromised, as a single factor
(password) is sufficient for access.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">High</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<h2 id="correlation-and-synthesis">Correlation and Synthesis</h2>
<p>The primary risk identified stems from the organizational policy
review. While the external network scan showed no immediate technical
vulnerabilities, the internal control gap related to computer login MFA
presents a significant internal risk. Should an attacker gain access to
a user’s password (e.g., via phishing or malware), they could
potentially access internal systems without an additional authentication
factor. This risk is amplified because it affects a fundamental access
vector for employees to internal resources. No pre-existing
vulnerabilities were provided for correlation.</p>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and enhance the overall cybersecurity
posture of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, the following
recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer
Logins (High Priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mandate MFA for all user accounts logging into organizational
computers, workstations, and servers.</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluate suitable MFA solutions that integrate with existing
identity providers (e.g., Active Directory, Azure AD) or deploy
standalone MFA solutions.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct comprehensive user training and communication campaigns
to ensure smooth adoption and understanding of the new MFA
requirements.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Vulnerability Scanning and Penetration
Testing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Schedule periodic external vulnerability scans (at least
quarterly) to identify any new open ports or exposed services that may
emerge due to configuration changes or new deployments.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider engaging in internal vulnerability scanning and
penetration testing to assess the security posture from within the
network, given the minimal external attack surface and the identified
internal control gap.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Review and Update Incident Response Plan:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ensure the incident response plan includes robust procedures for
responding to compromised credentials and unauthorized access to
internal workstations, especially in the context of the identified MFA
gap.</p></li>
<li><p>Regularly test the incident response plan through tabletop
exercises or simulations.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Continuous Security Awareness Training
Reinforcement:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>While current training is in place, continuously reinforce the
importance of strong, unique passwords and the risks associated with
phishing and social engineering, particularly until MFA for computer
logins is fully implemented and users are proficient with it.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p><strong>[Organization Name]</strong> demonstrates a foundational
understanding of several security best practices, particularly regarding
security awareness and MFA for critical systems like email and sensitive
data. However, the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for computer
logins represents a critical vulnerability that should be addressed
immediately to prevent unauthorized access to internal systems. By
diligently implementing the recommended MFA solution and maintaining
vigilance with continuous security assessments, <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong> can significantly strengthen its defense against common
cyber threats and enhance its overall security posture.</p>
