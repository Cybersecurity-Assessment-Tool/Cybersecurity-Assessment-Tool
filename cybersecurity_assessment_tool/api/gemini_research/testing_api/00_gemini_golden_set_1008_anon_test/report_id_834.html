<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">1. Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides an assessment of the current cybersecurity
posture for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on a recent
network scan, an organizational security questionnaire, and a review of
pre-existing risk data. The analysis reveals several critical gaps in
security controls, particularly concerning multi-factor authentication,
security awareness training, and policy enforcement. While the recent
network scan of the specified target did not identify any open network
ports, a pre-existing risk related to an unencrypted web server was
noted. This pre-existing risk, whose premise potentially contradicts the
current scan findings, warrants further investigation for specific
context or remediation status. Addressing the identified policy and
training deficiencies is paramount to elevating the overall security
posture and reducing human-centric risks.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The questionnaire responses indicate
critical weaknesses across several fundamental security domains. While
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is utilized for email access, its
absence for computer logins and sensitive data systems poses a
significant risk of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials.
Furthermore, the lack of an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and
comprehensive security awareness training for both new and existing
employees represents substantial gaps in the organization’s human and
policy-based security controls, increasing susceptibility to social
engineering and internal threats.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">4. Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on the specified target to identify
exposed services and potential vulnerabilities.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target Scanned:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> N/A (Date not provided in scan
metadata)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Used:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> The target host was reported as
‘up‘.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports and Services:</strong> The scan identified
<strong>no open network ports</strong> for the target . Specifically,
port 80 was found to be ‘closed‘.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The Nmap scan for the designated target
did not reveal any publicly exposed services. This suggests a relatively
hardened external posture for the scanned entity, at least concerning
common entry points typically identified by Nmap.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment">5. Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes findings from the security control review,
technical scan, and pre-existing vulnerability data to provide a
consolidated view of the organization’s risk landscape. Severity is
assigned based on potential impact and likelihood of exploitation. CVSS
scoring for existing vulnerabilities (where provided) is mapped to a
textual severity rating (0.1-3.9 Low, 4.0-6.9 Medium, 7.0-8.9 High,
9.0-10.0 Critical).</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">6. Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are provided to
improve the cybersecurity posture of <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong>. These recommendations are prioritized to address
critical control and policy gaps first.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Universally:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Require MFA for all computer logins across the organization to
significantly reduce the risk of credential-based attacks.</p></li>
<li><p>Mandate MFA for accessing all systems containing sensitive data
to protect critical assets from unauthorized access.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create a comprehensive AUP outlining appropriate use of
organizational assets, data, and systems, as well as prohibited
activities.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all employees read, understand, and formally acknowledge
the AUP upon hiring and annually thereafter.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement clear disciplinary procedures for AUP violations to
reinforce compliance.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish a Robust Security Awareness Training
Program:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement mandatory security awareness training for all new
employees during their onboarding process. This should cover fundamental
security concepts, phishing recognition, password hygiene, and data
handling.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct annual, mandatory security awareness training for all
employees. This training should be regularly updated to cover current
threat landscapes (e.g., advanced phishing techniques, social
engineering tactics, ransomware, business email compromise) and
reinforce security best practices.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider regular simulated phishing exercises to test and improve
employee awareness.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Investigate and Re-evaluate Pre-existing Technical
Risks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Specifically investigate the "Unencrypted Web Server" risk to
determine its current status. This includes confirming if the
vulnerability still exists, if it applies to a different asset not
covered by the recent Nmap scan of , or if it has been
remediated.</p></li>
<li><p>If any unencrypted web services are identified and legitimately
required, ensure they are secured (e.g., by placing them behind a Web
Application Firewall or proxy) or migrated to use HTTPS with strong TLS
configurations.</p></li>
</ul></li>
