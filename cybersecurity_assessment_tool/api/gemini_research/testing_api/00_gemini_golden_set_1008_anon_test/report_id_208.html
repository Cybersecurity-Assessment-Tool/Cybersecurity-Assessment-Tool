<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">1. Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report summarizes the cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on an organizational
security questionnaire and a limited network scan.</p>
<p>While the organization demonstrates strong adherence to multi-factor
authentication (MFA) practices across email, computer logins, and
sensitive data systems, critical gaps were identified concerning
foundational security policies and continuous employee education.
Specifically, the absence of an employee acceptable use policy and a
mandatory annual security awareness training program introduces
significant risks.</p>
<p>The external network scan, conducted on <code>[Target IP]</code>,
reported no open ports, which is a positive indication of a potentially
hardened perimeter or effective firewall configuration. However, due to
the limited scope and lack of specific target data, a comprehensive
technical vulnerability assessment could not be performed. No
pre-existing vulnerabilities were reported in the provided data.</p>
<p>Overall, while technical controls appear robust for MFA and external
exposure, the human element and policy framework represent the primary
areas for immediate improvement to strengthen the organization’s
security resilience.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="organizational-information">2. Organizational

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">4. Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>An Nmap network scan was performed targeting
<code>[Target IP]</code>. The scan reported no open ports, indicating
that the target system either has a well-configured firewall blocking
common ports or that the system was unreachable/unresponsive to the scan
probes for open ports.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target Scanned</strong>:
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date</strong>: Not specified in input.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Findings</strong>: No open ports were identified.
Consequently, no specific services, products, or versions could be
enumerated from this external scan. This limits the ability to identify
technical vulnerabilities such as outdated software versions or insecure
configurations through this method.</p></li>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">6. Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and further enhance the
organization’s cybersecurity posture, the following recommendations are
provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create a comprehensive AUP that clearly outlines employee
responsibilities for using organizational IT resources, data handling,
and internet/email usage.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all employees review, understand, and formally acknowledge
the AUP upon hiring and annually thereafter.</p></li>
<li><p>Integrate AUP compliance into employee performance reviews and
disciplinary actions.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish and Enforce Mandatory Annual Security Awareness
Training</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement a robust security awareness training program for all
employees, conducted at least once per year.</p></li>
<li><p>Training content should be current, engaging, and cover topics
such as phishing, social engineering, password hygiene, data privacy,
incident reporting procedures, and AUP adherence.</p></li>
<li><p>Use simulated phishing campaigns to test employee vigilance and
provide targeted remediation.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Expand Network Scan Scope and Detail</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Conduct more comprehensive network scans, including authenticated
scans, targeting specific internal and external assets.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure future scans identify services, products, and versions to
detect outdated software and known vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p>Investigate the possibility of an internal scan to uncover
misconfigurations or vulnerabilities within the internal network that
are not exposed externally.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">7. Conclusion</h1>
<p><strong>[Organization Name]</strong> demonstrates a foundational
commitment to security through its widespread implementation of MFA.
However, critical vulnerabilities exist in its human and policy
frameworks. By proactively addressing the absence of an AUP and annual
security awareness training, the organization can significantly
strengthen its defenses against common and evolving cyber threats.
Furthermore, expanding the scope of technical assessments will provide a
more complete picture of its overall security posture.</p>
