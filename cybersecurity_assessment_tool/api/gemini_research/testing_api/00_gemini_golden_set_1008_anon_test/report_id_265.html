<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides an assessment of the organization’s current
cybersecurity posture, based on a security questionnaire and a limited
network scan. The findings indicate several critical gaps in
foundational security controls and employee awareness, posing
significant risks to the organization’s information assets. A pervasive
lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA) for critical access points,
the absence of essential security policies, and inadequate security
awareness training are identified as key areas of concern. Furthermore,
a technical scan revealed an outdated public-facing web server component
(Nginx 1.18.0) which has reached its End-of-Life (EOL) and is likely
vulnerable to known exploits. Addressing these high-severity risks
requires immediate attention and comprehensive remediation efforts to
improve the overall security stance.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Analysis of Questionnaire Findings:</strong> The
questionnaire responses reveal significant vulnerabilities, particularly
concerning multi-factor authentication and security awareness. The lack
of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data systems means that
compromised credentials could lead to widespread unauthorized access and
data breaches. Furthermore, the absence of an acceptable use policy and
regular security awareness training exposes the organization to
increased risks from insider threats, social engineering, and general
human error. These are critical deficiencies that require immediate
attention.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on November 22, 2025 at 10:00 UTC
targeting . The scan identified the following open ports and
services:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Port <strong>443/tcp</strong>: <code>https</code> service running
<code>nginx 1.18.0</code></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Analysis of Technical Findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Outdated Service:</strong> The Nginx web server detected
on port 443 (version 1.18.0) is End-of-Life (EOL) as of May 2021. This
means it no longer receives security patches for newly discovered
vulnerabilities. Running EOL software, especially a public-facing web
server, significantly increases the risk of exploitation by attackers
who can leverage known, unpatched vulnerabilities. Immediate upgrade or
mitigation is required.</p></li>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the assessment, the following recommendations are provided
to enhance the organization’s cybersecurity posture:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA for Computers:</strong> Mandate MFA for all user
logins to company computers and workstations to prevent unauthorized
access via compromised credentials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> Implement MFA
for accessing all systems containing sensitive organizational or client
data.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce Security Policies:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> Create a
comprehensive AUP outlining the appropriate use of company IT resources,
data, and internet access. Ensure all employees review and acknowledge
the policy annually.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Robust Security Awareness Training
Program:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>New Employee Training:</strong> Implement mandatory
security awareness training as part of the onboarding process for all
new hires.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Annual Training:</strong> Conduct mandatory annual
security awareness training for all employees, covering current threats,
phishing prevention, data handling best practices, and policy
updates.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Address Technical Vulnerabilities:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade Nginx:</strong> Immediately upgrade the Nginx web
server (currently version 1.18.0) to the latest stable and supported
version. This will ensure the system receives crucial security patches
and fixes, mitigating the risk of exploitation from known
vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Patching:</strong> Establish a regular patching
and update schedule for all software, operating systems, and network
devices, especially those exposed to the internet.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The current cybersecurity posture of the organization presents
several high-severity risks stemming from control deficiencies in
foundational security practices and the use of outdated software.
Proactive and swift implementation of the recommended actions is crucial
to significantly improve the security posture, reduce the attack
surface, and protect organizational assets from potential threats.</p>
