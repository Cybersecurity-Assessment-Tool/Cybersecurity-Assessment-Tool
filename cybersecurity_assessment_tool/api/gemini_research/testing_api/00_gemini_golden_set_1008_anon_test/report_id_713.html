<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides an assessment of the current cybersecurity
posture for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on a network
scan, organizational security questionnaire responses, and a review of
existing risks. The assessment identified critical vulnerabilities,
notably an exposed Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) service on , which
presents a severe attack surface. Furthermore, significant gaps in
security controls related to Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
computer logins and a complete absence of regular security awareness
training for employees were identified. These findings indicate a
heightened risk profile for unauthorized access, data breaches, and
successful social engineering attacks. Immediate action is required to
mitigate the exposed RDP service and implement foundational security
training and MFA controls.</p>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A review of the organization’s self-reported security controls
reveals several critical gaps, particularly concerning Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) and employee security awareness training. The
presence of ’No’ responses indicates areas requiring immediate attention
to strengthen the overall security posture.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A targeted network scan was conducted on the identified target to
discover exposed services. The scan results confirm an open Remote
Desktop Protocol (RDP) service, which aligns with existing risk data and
presents a critical vulnerability.</p>

<p>The exposure of port <code>3389</code> (RDP) to the internet is a
critical finding, as RDP is a frequent target for brute-force attacks
and exploits, potentially leading to unauthorized system access. Without
specific product and version information, it is difficult to assess
specific CVEs, but the service’s mere exposure is a significant
risk.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To significantly improve the cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, the following recommendations are
provided. These steps are actionable and prioritized to address the most
critical identified risks.</p>
<h2 id="immediate-actions">Immediate Actions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Mitigate RDP Exposure:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediately restrict public internet
access to port <code>3389</code> on . This can be achieved by
configuring firewall rules to allow access only from trusted internal
networks or specific, authorized, and trusted IP addresses (e.g., jump
boxes).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Exposed RDP is a high-risk attack
vector commonly exploited by attackers for initial access and lateral
movement. Rapid remediation is crucial.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="short-term-actions-within-1-3-months">Short-Term Actions (Within
1-3 Months)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Logins:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Deploy and enforce Multi-Factor
Authentication for all user logins to company computers and servers.
This should be a mandatory requirement for all accounts accessing
organizational assets.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rationale:</strong> MFA is a critical security control
that significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, even if
primary credentials are stolen or compromised.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Initiate Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop and implement a mandatory
security awareness training program for all new employees, to be
completed during their onboarding process.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rationale:</strong> New employees are often prime targets
for social engineering attacks due to their unfamiliarity with
organizational policies and common threats. Proper training from day one
builds a strong security culture.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="long-term-actions-ongoing">Long-Term Actions (Ongoing)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Establish Annual Security Awareness Training
Program:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Implement an ongoing, mandatory annual
security awareness training program for all employees. This should
include topics such as phishing, malware recognition, password hygiene,
social engineering tactics, and data handling best practices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Regular training reinforces security
best practices, keeps employees informed of new and evolving threats,
and helps build a resilient "human firewall."</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Secure Remote Access to RDP via VPN:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> For legitimate remote access to RDP
services, implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution. All RDP
traffic should only be accessible through the VPN, further enhancing
security and auditing capabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rationale:</strong> A VPN encrypts traffic and requires
strong authentication before granting network access, providing a much
more secure method for remote RDP access compared to direct public
exposure.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Vulnerability Scanning and Penetration
Testing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Implement a schedule for regular
internal and external vulnerability scanning and periodic penetration
testing to proactively identify and address security weaknesses across
the entire IT infrastructure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Continuous assessment ensures that
new vulnerabilities are identified and remediated before they can be
exploited, adapting to the evolving threat landscape.</p></li>
