<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">1. Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong> based on a review of organizational
security controls, a network vulnerability scan, and known existing
risks. The assessment reveals several critical and high-severity
findings, primarily concerning an outdated and insecure FTP server that
allows anonymous access, significant gaps in Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) implementation for email, and fundamental policy and training
deficiencies. The organization’s reliance on End-of-Life operating
systems further exacerbates its risk profile. Immediate attention to
these areas is crucial to enhance security and protect sensitive assets
from compromise.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-security-control-gaps">3.1.
Analysis of Security Control Gaps</h2>
<p>The questionnaire revealed several high-priority gaps in fundamental
security practices:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Email (Q1):</strong> Not requiring
Multi-Factor Authentication for email access significantly increases the
risk of account compromise through phishing and credential stuffing
attacks. Email accounts are often a primary vector for initial access to
corporate networks and data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Missing Acceptable Use Policy (Q4):</strong> The absence
of an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) leaves employees without clear
guidelines for acceptable behavior regarding company assets and data.
This can lead to inconsistent practices, potential misuse, increased
data breach risks, and compliance violations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Security Awareness Training for New Employees
(Q5):</strong> New employees are often prime targets for social
engineering attacks due to their unfamiliarity with organizational
security protocols. Without initial security awareness training, they
are more susceptible to phishing, malware, and other attacks, posing an
immediate risk to the organization.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">4. Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on the target system to identify open
ports and services. As the specific target was not provided, a
placeholder is used.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Target:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports and Services:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 21/TCP (FTP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Service:</strong> FTP
(<code>vsftpd 2.3.4</code>)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Status:</strong> Open</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Details:</strong> The FTP server is running
<code>vsftpd 2.3.4</code>. This version is critically outdated, having
been released in 2011 and is End-of-Life. It is known to contain severe
vulnerabilities, including a backdoor (CVE-2011-2523) that allows
arbitrary command execution.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Critical Finding:</strong> Anonymous FTP login is
explicitly allowed. This configuration enables unauthorized users to
access the FTP server without credentials, potentially leading to data
exfiltration, unauthorized file uploads (for malware hosting or
command-and-control), or further system compromise.</p></li>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">6. Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and significantly improve the overall
cybersecurity posture, the following actionable recommendations are
provided.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="critical-recommendations">6.1. Critical
Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immediately disable Anonymous FTP access:</strong> Review
the FTP server configuration to disable anonymous login. If any form of
public access is strictly required, implement stringent read-only
permissions and ensure no sensitive data is accessible. Consider
alternative, more secure methods for public file distribution.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade or replace vsftpd:</strong> Urgently upgrade the
FTP server to a current, supported version of <code>vsftpd</code> or
replace it with a more secure file transfer solution (e.g., SFTP, SCP,
or a cloud-based file sharing service). Ensure all services are patched
regularly. If the FTP server is not essential, consider decommissioning
it entirely.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="high-priority-recommendations">6.2.
High-Priority Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email:</strong> Mandate Multi-Factor
Authentication for all organizational email accounts. This is a
fundamental security control that significantly reduces the risk of
account compromise due to stolen credentials and phishing
attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a comprehensive AUP that outlines proper use of
organizational IT assets, data handling procedures, internet usage
guidelines, and expectations for employee conduct. Ensure all employees
review, understand, and formally acknowledge this policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Initiate Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong> Implement mandatory security awareness training for
all new hires as part of their onboarding process. This training should
educate them on common threats like phishing, social engineering,
malware, and safe data handling practices to mitigate immediate
risks.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="moderate-priority-recommendations">6.3.
Moderate-Priority Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade End-of-Life Operating Systems:</strong> Plan and
execute an upgrade path for all workstations and servers running Windows
7 to a currently supported operating system (e.g., Windows 10/11 or a
modern server OS). Prioritize systems handling sensitive data or those
with direct internet exposure. Implement a robust patch management
program for all systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enhance Regular Security Awareness Training:</strong>
While existing training for all employees is commendable, ensure its
content is routinely updated to cover evolving threats, new attack
techniques, and current best practices. Incorporate phishing simulations
and interactive modules.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">7. Conclusion</h1>
<p>The current cybersecurity posture of <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong> presents several significant vulnerabilities,
particularly with the critical exposure from the anonymous and outdated
FTP server. Addressing these immediate technical findings, alongside the
fundamental gaps in MFA for email, the absence of an acceptable use
policy, and the lack of new employee security training, is paramount. By
diligently implementing the recommendations outlined in this report,
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong> can significantly reduce its attack
surface, enhance its resilience against prevalent cyber threats, and
foster a stronger overall security culture.</p>
