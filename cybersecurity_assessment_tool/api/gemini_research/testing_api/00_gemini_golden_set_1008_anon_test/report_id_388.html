<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings from a cybersecurity posture
assessment conducted for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The
assessment involved a review of the organization’s security controls
based on a questionnaire, a technical network scan of the target
<code>[Target IP]</code>, and an analysis of any pre-existing risks.</p>
<p>The security questionnaire revealed several critical gaps, notably
the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive
data systems and the absence of security awareness training for new
employees. These areas represent significant organizational risks that
could be exploited.</p>
<p>The technical network scan performed on <code>[Target IP]</code> did
not identify any open ports or services. This indicates a potentially
hardened external attack surface or robust perimeter filtering, which is
a positive finding. However, it’s important to note that an external
scan provides a limited view and does not assess internal network
vulnerabilities or application-specific risks.</p>
<p>No pre-existing vulnerabilities or risks were provided for this
assessment. Therefore, the identified risks are primarily derived from
the organizational control gaps.</p>
<p>Overall, while the external network security appears robust based on
the scan, the organization faces significant risks due to insufficient
security awareness training and inadequate MFA implementation for
critical systems. Addressing these gaps is paramount to improving the
overall security posture.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="key-observations-from-questionnaire">Key
Observations from Questionnaire</h2>
<p>The questionnaire highlights two significant areas of concern:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> The
absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive
data systems is a critical security vulnerability. This significantly
increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are
compromised.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong> Failure to conduct security awareness training for
new employees means that new hires might be unaware of critical security
policies, social engineering tactics, and best practices, potentially
making them easy targets for attackers and introducing preventable risks
to the organization.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on the designated target
<code>[Target IP]</code> using Nmap to identify open ports, running
services, and potential vulnerabilities.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="scan-summary">Scan Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target Host:</strong> <code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Status:</strong> Up</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports:</strong> None detected. All scanned ports
were reported as <code>closed</code> or <code>filtered</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="detailed-findings">Detailed Findings</h2>
<p>The network scan of <code>[Target IP]</code> did not identify any
open ports or active services listening externally. This is a positive
indicator, suggesting that the target host or the network perimeter is
configured to restrict external access effectively. This could be due to
robust firewall rules, network segmentation, or simply that the host
does not offer any services to the internet.</p>
<p>While this finding reduces the immediate external attack surface, it
is important to remember that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This scan provides an external perspective only and does not
assess internal network security.</p></li>
<li><p>Web application vulnerabilities, even on closed ports, are not
detectable via this type of network scan.</p></li>
<li><p>Misconfigurations or vulnerabilities on internal systems remain
unassessed.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section compiles the identified security gaps from the
questionnaire, potential technical vulnerabilities, and any pre-existing
risks to present a comprehensive view of the organization’s current risk
posture.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="identified-gaps-from-questionnaire">5.1
Identified Gaps from Questionnaire</h2>
<p>Based on the security control review, the following critical gaps
have been identified:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Risk Name: Inadequate MFA for Sensitive Data
Systems</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Overview:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication is not
required for accessing systems containing sensitive data. This leaves
these critical systems vulnerable to unauthorized access through
compromised credentials (e.g., via phishing, brute-force attacks, or
credential stuffing).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Risk Name: Absence of New Employee Security Awareness
Training</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Overview:</strong> New employees are not provided with
security awareness training. This introduces a significant human factor
risk, as new hires may be unaware of company security policies, common
social engineering tactics, and secure operational practices, making
them susceptible to manipulation and potential vectors for internal
breaches.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Severity:</strong> Medium</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="technical-vulnerabilities">5.2 Technical
Vulnerabilities</h2>
<p>Based on the conducted external network scan, no technical
vulnerabilities such as open ports with outdated or vulnerable services
were identified. The target <code>[Target IP]</code> appears to have a
hardened external attack surface.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="pre-existing-risks">5.3 Pre-existing
Risks</h2>
<p>No pre-existing vulnerabilities or risks were provided in the input
data for this assessment.</p>
