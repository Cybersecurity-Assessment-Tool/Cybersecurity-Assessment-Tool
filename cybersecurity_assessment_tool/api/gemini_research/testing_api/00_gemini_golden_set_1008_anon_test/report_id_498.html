<h2 id="port-scan-analysis">Port Scan Analysis</h2>
<p>The Nmap scan against revealed that all commonly scanned ports,

a positive external security posture, as there are no immediately
exploitable services exposed to the internet via these ports from this
scan’s perspective. No open services were identified.</p>

closure and ensure no other unencrypted web services exist, or that any
prior unencrypted service has been properly secured or

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the assessment, the following recommendations are provided
to enhance <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>’s cybersecurity
posture.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong>
Immediately implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all systems
that contain or provide access to sensitive data. This is a critical
control to prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are
compromised. Prioritize systems based on the sensitivity of data they
protect.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a comprehensive AUP outlining employee
responsibilities regarding company assets, data handling, internet
usage, and security protocols. Ensure all employees are trained on the
AUP, understand its implications, and formally acknowledge its
terms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Verify Mitigation of Unencrypted Web Server
Risk:</strong> Conduct an internal verification to confirm that no
unencrypted web services are inadvertently exposed. If the prior
unencrypted service (e.g., on port 80) was intentionally shut down,
confirm appropriate decommissioning. If it was moved or replaced, ensure
the new service or location is properly secured and encrypted using
HTTPS/TLS.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Network Scanning and Vulnerability
Management:</strong> Establish and adhere to a routine schedule for both
external and internal network scans. This proactive measure will help
identify and address newly emerging vulnerabilities, misconfigurations,
or changes in network exposure before they can be exploited.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Continuous Security Awareness Training
Enhancement:</strong> While training is performed, ensure the content is
updated regularly to reflect current threat landscapes, organizational
policies (like the new AUP), and new attack vectors. Reinforce the
importance of adherence to security best practices.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p><strong>[Organization Name]</strong> demonstrates strengths in
foundational security practices such as general MFA implementation and
employee security awareness training. The external network scan also
indicates a strong posture with no open ports identified. However,
significant opportunities for improvement exist, particularly in
securing sensitive data systems with MFA and establishing clear employee
conduct policies. Addressing these gaps, along with continuous
monitoring and proactive risk management, will significantly bolster the
organization’s resilience against cyber threats and contribute to a more
robust overall security posture.</p>
