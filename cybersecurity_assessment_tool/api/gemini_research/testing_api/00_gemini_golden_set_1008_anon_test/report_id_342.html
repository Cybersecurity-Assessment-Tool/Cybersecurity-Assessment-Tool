<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a cybersecurity posture assessment for
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, synthesizing data from a recent
network scan, responses to a security questionnaire, and existing risk
documentation. The analysis highlights both strengths and critical areas
for improvement. While multi-factor authentication is broadly
implemented, significant gaps exist in formal policy adoption
(Acceptable Use Policy) and comprehensive, annual security awareness
training for all employees. The technical scan revealed no open ports on
the designated target, which may indicate effective perimeter security
or successful remediation of previously identified vulnerabilities. Key
recommendations focus on addressing policy and training deficiencies,
alongside verifying the current status of past technical findings.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-questionnaire-gaps">Analysis of
Questionnaire Gaps</h2>
<p>The "No" responses highlight critical security gaps that could expose
the organization to various risks:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong>
The absence of a formal AUP means employees may lack clear guidelines on
the appropriate use of IT resources. This can lead to security
vulnerabilities, non-compliance issues, and increased legal exposure due
to employee misuse or negligence.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training:</strong>
While new hires receive initial training, the lack of annual,
organization-wide security awareness training leaves all employees
susceptible to evolving cyber threats, such as sophisticated phishing
campaigns, social engineering tactics, and emerging malware. Regular
training is essential for maintaining a strong human firewall and
adapting to the dynamic threat landscape.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was conducted on the specified target to identify open
ports and services, providing an external view of the target’s network
exposure.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> 2026-01-26</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Target IP/Hostname:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Used:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> The target host was reported as
<code>up</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="detailed-port-scan-findings">Detailed Port
Scan Findings</h2>
<p>The Nmap scan results for <code>[Target IP]</code> indicated the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>No open ports were identified during this scan. Specifically,
port 80, which was referenced in a prior risk assessment, was found to
be <code>closed</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This finding suggests that the scanned target’s perimeter security
may be robust, or that previously identified vulnerabilities involving
open ports have been successfully remediated.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the comprehensive analysis, the following actionable
recommendations are provided to enhance the cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement a Formal Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create a clear, concise, and comprehensive AUP document that
defines the acceptable and unacceptable use of all organizational IT
assets, including networks, systems, software, and data.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure mandatory review and acknowledgement of the AUP by all
employees upon hiring and annually thereafter.</p></li>
<li><p>Integrate AUP awareness into new hire and ongoing security
training programs.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish and Enforce Annual Security Awareness Training
for All Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement a mandatory and recurring security awareness training
program for all employees, conducted at least once per year. This should
extend beyond initial onboarding training for new hires.</p></li>
<li><p>The training content should be updated regularly to address
current threats (e.g., phishing techniques, ransomware, business email
compromise) and reinforce best practices for data handling, password
hygiene, and incident reporting.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider utilizing engaging and interactive training modules,
including simulated phishing exercises, to enhance employee retention
and effectiveness.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Verify and Reassess Previous Technical
Findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Investigate the discrepancy between the current scan finding
(port 80 closed) and the previously identified "Unencrypted Web Server"
risk (port 80 open).</p></li>
<li><p>Confirm if the previous assessment referred to the same target IP
address or a different system. If the current target was indeed the
subject of the prior risk, document the successful remediation of port
80 being closed.</p></li>
<li><p>If the risk pertains to a different system or IP address, perform
a targeted scan on that specific system to validate its current status
and ensure that appropriate encryption (SSL/TLS) is enforced for any
public-facing web services.</p></li>
</ul></li>
