<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The assessment
involved a review of organizational security controls through a
questionnaire, a technical network scan of <code>[Target IP]</code>, and
an analysis of pre-existing risk data. Our analysis identified several
critical gaps in security controls and potential vulnerabilities that
require immediate attention to enhance the organization’s overall
security posture. Key areas of concern include the lack of multi-factor
authentication (MFA) for computer logins, the absence of an acceptable
use policy, insufficient annual security awareness training, and an open
SSH port. Addressing these issues proactively is essential for
strengthening defenses against potential cyber threats.</p>

<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the security control questionnaire
responses, the technical network scan findings, and the provided
pre-existing risk data (which was empty), the following risks have been
identified.</p>
<table>

<th style="text-align: left;"><strong>Severity</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of MFA for Computer Access</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Without Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
for computer logins, compromised user credentials (e.g., via phishing or
brute-force attacks) can lead to unauthorized access to internal
systems, potentially escalating privileges and leading to data breaches
or system compromise. This significantly increases the risk of lateral
movement within the network.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">High</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Absence of Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP)</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The lack of a formal Acceptable Use Policy
means employees may not be aware of expected behavior regarding company
IT assets, data, and internet usage. This can lead to inconsistent
practices, misuse of resources, increased legal liabilities, and
potential security incidents arising from unmanaged employee
actions.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Medium</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Insufficient Annual Security Awareness
Training</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Failing to conduct regular, at least
annual, security awareness training for all employees leaves the
organization vulnerable to human-centric attacks such as phishing,
social engineering, and malware. Employees who are not regularly updated
on current threats may lack the knowledge to identify and report
suspicious activities, making them a primary target.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Medium</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Open SSH Port on</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">An open SSH (Secure Shell) port presents
an attack surface that malicious actors could exploit. Common attack
vectors include brute-force attacks against user credentials, credential
stuffing using stolen login pairs, or exploiting unpatched
vulnerabilities in the SSH service itself if not properly configured and
secured.</td>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and enhance the overall
cybersecurity posture of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, the
following actionable recommendations are provided, categorized by
priority.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="high-priority-recommendations">High Priority
Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for All Computer Logins:</strong>
Immediately implement and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
all employee computer logins, especially for administrative accounts and
systems processing sensitive data. This significantly reduces the risk
of unauthorized access even if primary credentials are stolen.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="medium-priority-recommendations">Medium
Priority Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a comprehensive AUP that clearly outlines
employee responsibilities and permissible use of company IT assets,
data, and network resources. Ensure all employees review, understand,
and formally acknowledge the AUP, and integrate it into new employee
onboarding processes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Regular Security Awareness Training:</strong>
Establish and implement a mandatory annual security awareness training
program for all employees. Training should cover current threat
landscapes, phishing, social engineering tactics, secure data handling,
password best practices, and incident reporting procedures. Supplement
annual training with regular phishing simulations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Secure Open SSH Port:</strong> Review the configuration
of the open SSH port (22/tcp) on <code>[Target IP]</code>. Implement
robust security measures including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Access Restrictions:</strong> Limit SSH access to trusted
IP addresses or networks using firewall rules.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Authentication Method:</strong> Disable password-based
authentication and rely solely on strong, regularly rotated key-based
authentication.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>MFA for SSH:</strong> Implement MFA for SSH access if
supported by the environment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Software Updates:</strong> Ensure the SSH service is
running the latest stable version and is regularly patched to address
known vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Monitoring:</strong> Implement intrusion
detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) and robust logging to monitor for
brute-force attempts and suspicious SSH activity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Non-Standard Port:</strong> Consider moving SSH to a
non-standard port to reduce automated scanning noise (though this does
not remove the underlying vulnerability if exploited).</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>This cybersecurity posture assessment provides a critical snapshot of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>’s current security landscape.
Addressing the identified gaps in security controls and actively
mitigating the highlighted technical vulnerabilities is paramount for
strengthening defenses against the evolving cyber threat landscape.
Proactive and timely implementation of the provided recommendations will
significantly enhance the organization’s overall resilience, reduce its
exposure to common cyberattacks, and improve its long-term security
posture. Continued vigilance, regular security reviews, and ongoing
employee education are vital for maintaining a strong security
posture.</p>
