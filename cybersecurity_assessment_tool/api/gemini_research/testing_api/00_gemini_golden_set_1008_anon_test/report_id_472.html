<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">1. Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides an assessment of the current cybersecurity
posture for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on a security
questionnaire and a limited network scan. While no immediate critical
technical vulnerabilities were identified in the provided scan data,
several significant security control gaps were identified through the
questionnaire, primarily concerning Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
implementation and security awareness training. These gaps represent
high-priority risks that require immediate attention to enhance the
organization’s defensive capabilities against common cyber threats.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-security-controls">3.1 Analysis
of Security Controls</h2>
<p>The questionnaire highlights significant weaknesses in critical
areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Gaps:</strong> MFA is
not required for logging into computers (Q2) or accessing sensitive data
systems (Q3). This is a severe vulnerability, as compromised credentials
(e.g., via phishing) could grant attackers easy access to internal
systems and sensitive data without an additional layer of
authentication.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Security Awareness Training Deficiencies:</strong> The
organization does not conduct security awareness training for new
employees (Q5) nor annual training for all employees (Q6). This
significantly increases the risk of successful social engineering
attacks, malware infections, and policy violations due to a lack of
employee understanding of cybersecurity best practices and
threats.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">4. Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on the target .</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not explicitly provided in input
data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Target:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Findings:</strong> The scan reported no open ports on the
target. All extra ports were reported as closed.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-technical-scan">4.1 Analysis of
Technical Scan</h2>
<p>The absence of open ports on the target is a positive finding,
suggesting a minimal external attack surface or robust perimeter
defenses. However, it is important to note that this scan was limited
and does not provide insight into internal network configurations,
potential vulnerabilities on internal systems, or web application
security if applicable. A comprehensive assessment would require
authenticated internal scans and deeper application-layer testing.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment">5. Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the questionnaire and technical scan data,
the following risks have been identified. No pre-existing
vulnerabilities were provided in the input data.</p>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of MFA for Computers</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Without MFA, compromised user credentials

</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data

attacks, risking data breaches, compliance violations, and reputational
damage.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">No New Employee Security Training</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">New employees are often targets for social
engineering. Without initial training, they are more susceptible to
phishing, malware, and unknowingly violating security policies,
increasing the overall organizational risk.</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">High</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">No Annual Security Awareness Training</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Without regular security awareness
training, employees may not be updated on current threats and best
practices, leading to a decay in security posture over time and an
increased likelihood of successful cyberattacks.</td>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">6. Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and improve the overall cybersecurity
posture of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, the following
recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Logins:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Deploy and enforce Multi-Factor
Authentication for all user logins to corporate computers and
workstations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Significantly reduces the risk of
unauthorized access even if primary credentials are
compromised.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> <strong>Critical</strong></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Mandate Multi-Factor Authentication for
access to all systems containing sensitive or critical organizational
data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Provides an essential layer of security
for the most valuable assets, protecting against data breaches and
compliance failures.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> <strong>Critical</strong></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish New Employee Security Awareness
Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop and implement a mandatory
security awareness training program for all new hires during their
onboarding process.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Ensures that all employees understand
their role in maintaining security from day one, reducing immediate
susceptibility to common threats.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> <strong>High</strong></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Annual Security Awareness
Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Institute a mandatory annual (or more
frequent) security awareness training program for all
employees.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Keeps employees informed about evolving
threats, reinforces best practices, and maintains a strong human
firewall against cyberattacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> <strong>High</strong></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Comprehensive Security Assessments:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Perform regular, comprehensive security
assessments, including authenticated internal network scans,
vulnerability assessments of all systems, and penetration testing (both
internal and external, including web applications if
applicable).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Identifies hidden vulnerabilities and
provides a more complete picture of the attack surface, beyond what a
limited external scan can reveal.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> Medium (Ongoing)</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">7. Conclusion</h1>
<p>While the external network scan showed no immediate open ports, the
questionnaire responses reveal critical gaps in <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong>’s security controls, particularly concerning MFA
implementation and security awareness training. Addressing these
fundamental deficiencies should be the immediate focus to significantly
improve the organization’s resilience against modern cyber threats.
Proactive implementation of the recommended controls will strengthen the
overall security posture and reduce the likelihood of successful
attacks.</p>
