<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">1. Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, drawing insights from a
network scan, an organizational security questionnaire, and existing
risk data. The analysis reveals several critical and high-priority
vulnerabilities. Key findings include an outdated and insecurely
configured FTP server, significant gaps in fundamental security controls
such as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins, and an
absence of structured employee security awareness training programs.
Furthermore, the continued use of end-of-life operating systems on
workstations presents a substantial risk due to lack of vendor support
and security updates. This report outlines actionable recommendations to
mitigate these identified risks and significantly enhance the
organization’s defensive capabilities against contemporary cyber
threats.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">4. Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was conducted on the designated target to identify
active hosts, open ports, and running services. This provides insight
into the exposed attack surface.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="scan-details">4.1. Scan Details</h2>
<ul>

<li><p><strong>Scanner:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="open-ports-and-services">4.2. Open Ports and
Services</h2>
<p>The following open port and service were identified during the
scan:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 21/tcp (FTP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Service Name:</strong> ftp</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Product:</strong> vsftpd</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Version:</strong> 2.3.4</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Script Output:</strong></p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Analysis of Technical Findings:</em> The presence of an open FTP
service running ‘vsftpd‘ version 2.3.4 is highly concerning. This
version, released in 2011, is severely outdated and contains known
vulnerabilities (e.g., CVE-2011-2523, CVE-2011-0761). Furthermore, the
‘ftp-anon‘ script output explicitly states "Anonymous FTP login
allowed," which is a critical security misconfiguration, potentially
allowing unauthorized users to read, write, or delete files, depending
on the server’s configuration.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">6. Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and strengthen the cybersecurity
posture of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, the following
actionable recommendations are provided. These are prioritized based on
their assessed severity.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Address Anonymous FTP and Outdated Software (Critical
Risk):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Action:</strong> Disable anonymous FTP access
on (port 21) without delay. Ensure that only authenticated users with
strong credentials can access the FTP server, and only if absolutely
necessary.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Software Update:</strong> Upgrade ‘vsftpd‘ to the latest
stable and patched version to remediate known vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Protocol Modernization:</strong> Strongly consider
migrating from FTP to a more secure file transfer protocol, such as SFTP
(SSH File Transfer Protocol) or SCP (Secure Copy Protocol), which
encrypts data in transit and provides robust authentication
mechanisms.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Logins (High
Risk):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Planning &amp; Procurement:</strong> Research and
implement a robust Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) solution for all
computer logins across the organization. This should apply to all user
accounts, including administrative accounts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enforcement:</strong> Develop and enforce a policy
requiring MFA for accessing all workstations, servers, and critical
internal systems.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Comprehensive Security Awareness Training (High
Risk):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>New Employee Training:</strong> Develop and implement a
mandatory security awareness training program as part of the onboarding
process for all new employees.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Annual Training:</strong> Institute annual, mandatory
security awareness training for all existing employees. Training content
should cover prevalent threats (e.g., phishing, ransomware), secure
browsing habits, password hygiene, data handling policies, and incident
reporting procedures.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade End-of-Life Operating Systems (Medium
Risk):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Migration Plan:</strong> Develop and execute a phased
plan to upgrade all workstations currently running Windows 7 to a
currently supported operating system (e.g., Windows 10 or 11).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Patch Management:</strong> Ensure that all operating
systems and software applications are kept up-to-date with the latest
security patches and updates through a robust patch management
strategy.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">7. Conclusion</h1>
<p>This cybersecurity posture assessment has identified several critical
areas requiring urgent attention within <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong>. By promptly addressing the highly vulnerable FTP
service, implementing Multi-Factor Authentication for computer logins,
establishing comprehensive security awareness training, and upgrading
end-of-life operating systems, the organization can significantly
strengthen its security posture. A proactive and continuous commitment
to cybersecurity best practices will be essential to protect against the
evolving threat landscape and maintain the confidentiality, integrity,
and availability of organizational assets.</p>
