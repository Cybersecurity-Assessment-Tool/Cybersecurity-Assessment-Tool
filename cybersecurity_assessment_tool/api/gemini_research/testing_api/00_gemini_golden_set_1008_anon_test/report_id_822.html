<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on an analysis of
network scan data, an organizational security questionnaire, and a list
of pre-existing risks. The assessment reveals a foundational commitment
to security in certain areas, particularly regarding Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for email access and initial security awareness
training for new employees. However, significant vulnerabilities and
critical gaps were identified, including the lack of MFA for computer
logins and sensitive data systems, the absence of an Employee Acceptable
Use Policy (AUP), and insufficient annual security awareness
training.</p>
<p>While the recent network scan did not identify any directly
exploitable open ports on the target, it is crucial to address the
identified policy and training deficiencies, as these represent
substantial internal security risks. Addressing these organizational and
process-level gaps will significantly enhance the overall security
posture and reduce the overall attack surface, even if external-facing
services are minimal.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">3. Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on the target <code>[Target IP]</code>.
The scan aimed to identify open ports, running services, and potential
vulnerabilities from an external perspective.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="scan-details">Scan Details</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target(s):</strong> <code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="findings">Findings</h2>
<p>The scan results indicate that no open ports were identified during
this assessment of <code>[Target IP]</code>. All scanned ports,
including port 80, were found to be in a ’closed’ state. This is a
positive finding as it indicates a minimal external attack surface
directly exposed via these commonly scanned ports. It is important to
note that a lack of open ports does not equate to complete security, as
internal vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or risks associated with
other vectors can still exist.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment">4. Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes findings from the questionnaire, technical
scan, and pre-existing vulnerabilities to present a consolidated view of
the organization’s risk landscape.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="identified-risks-and-gaps">4.1 Identified
Risks and Gaps</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer
Login:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Overview:</strong> Users can access organizational
computers without a second authentication factor. This significantly
increases the risk of unauthorized access through compromised
credentials (e.g., phishing, malware, brute-force attacks).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Correlated with:</strong> Q2 ("Do you require MFA to log
into computers?")</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive
Data Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Overview:</strong> Sensitive data systems, which
typically house critical organizational or client data, lack an
additional layer of authentication. This makes them highly vulnerable to
breaches if primary credentials are stolen or otherwise
compromised.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Correlated with:</strong> Q3 ("Do you require MFA to
access sensitive data systems?")</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Overview:</strong> Without a clear AUP, employees may be
unaware of their responsibilities, limitations, and best practices
regarding the use of company IT assets, networks, and data. This can
lead to unintentional misuse, data leakage, compliance issues, or
security incidents.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Correlated with:</strong> Q4 ("Does your organization
have an employee acceptable use policy?")</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness
Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Overview:</strong> While new employees receive initial
training, the absence of mandatory annual refresher training for all
staff means that security knowledge may become outdated. Employees might
not be informed about evolving threats (e.g., new phishing tactics) or
updated security policies, increasing the human-factor risk.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Correlated with:</strong> Q6 ("Does your organization do
security awareness training for all employees at least once per
year?")</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Pre-existing Risk: Unencrypted Web Server (Discrepancy
Noted):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Overview:</strong> The organization previously identified
a risk related to an unencrypted web server, with the specific overview
stating "Port 80 is open."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Severity:</strong> Medium (CVSS 5.0)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Observation:</strong> The current network scan, detailed
in Section 3, indicates that Port 80 is presently <em>closed</em> on the
target system. This contradicts the premise of this pre-existing
vulnerability (an open Port 80), suggesting potential successful
remediation efforts or a change in network configuration since the risk
was initially identified. Further verification is recommended to confirm
the current status and ensure no other unencrypted web services are
present.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Logins:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Deploy and enforce Multi-Factor
Authentication for all user logins to organizational computers, laptops,
and virtual desktops.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Dramatically reduces the risk of
unauthorized access due to compromised credentials, especially in
scenarios like phishing or password reuse.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Mandate MFA for accessing all systems,
applications, and databases that contain or process sensitive
organizational or client data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Provides an essential, robust layer of
protection for critical information assets, safeguarding against data
breaches.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Draft, thoroughly review (with legal
counsel if necessary), disseminate, and enforce a clear AUP. This policy
should explicitly outline acceptable use of all IT resources, data
handling procedures, and security expectations for all
employees.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Establishes clear guidelines, mitigates
risks of misuse or negligence, and strengthens overall data governance
and compliance.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Mandatory Annual Security Awareness Training
Program:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Implement a comprehensive, mandatory
annual security awareness training program for all employees (not just
new hires). This training should cover current threat landscapes,
organizational policies, and best practices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Keeps all employees informed about
evolving threats, reinforces security best practices, and significantly
reduces human-factor vulnerabilities like phishing or social
engineering.</p></li>
</ul></li>

id="verification-and-remediation-medium-priority">5.2 Verification and
Remediation (Medium Priority)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Verify "Unencrypted Web Server" Status:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Conduct an internal review to
investigate the historical context of the "Unencrypted Web Server" risk.
Confirm if Port 80 was indeed open previously and if the current
’closed’ status on <code>[Target IP]</code> is a result of successful,
documented remediation. If the risk refers to other services or systems,
those should also be evaluated.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Ensures the organization’s risk
register is accurate and reflects the current state of the environment,
validating successful remediation or identifying persistent
issues.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>While the external technical network perimeter appears robust with no
open ports identified in the recent scan, the organizational security
posture of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong> is significantly
undermined by critical policy and training deficiencies. Prioritizing
the implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication across all critical
access points, establishing a clear Acceptable Use Policy, and enforcing
comprehensive annual security awareness training will address the most
pressing risks. These foundational security measures will build a
stronger, more resilient defense against both internal and external
threats, fostering a more secure operational environment. Continuous
monitoring, regular security assessments, and adherence to security best
practices are recommended to maintain an effective and adaptive security
posture.</p>
