<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment for _name. The assessment was conducted on _date_display and
involved a review of organizational security controls via a
questionnaire, a targeted network scan, and an analysis of existing risk
documentation (none provided). The objective is to provide a
comprehensive overview of the current security landscape, identify
critical vulnerabilities and risks, and offer actionable recommendations
to enhance the overall security posture.</p>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A questionnaire covering fundamental security controls was provided
to the organization. The responses indicate several critical gaps in
security practices, particularly concerning Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) and employee security awareness.</p>

<h3 id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of Technical
Findings</h3>
<p>The Nginx web server running on version _version (released April
2020) is significantly outdated. As of current knowledge, much newer
stable versions (e.g., 1.24.x, 1.26.x) are available, incorporating
numerous security patches and bug fixes. Running an outdated web server
greatly increases the risk of exploitation through publicly known
vulnerabilities (CVEs) that have been addressed in later versions,
potentially leading to data breaches, denial of service, or complete
system compromise.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the security control review and technical scan results, the
following high and medium-severity risks have been identified. No
pre-existing vulnerabilities were provided in the input data, therefore
all identified risks are new findings from this assessment.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and significantly enhance _name’s
cybersecurity posture, the following actionable recommendations are
provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for All
Critical Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Immediately enable and enforce MFA for all email accounts across
the _domain.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement MFA for all computer logins, especially for users
accessing sensitive data or systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Extend MFA coverage to any other critical internal or
external-facing applications to fortify access controls.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade and Patch Software Regularly:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Prioritize the upgrade of the Nginx web server on _ip from
version _version to the latest stable and supported version.</p></li>
<li><p>Establish a robust patch management program to ensure all
operating systems, applications, and network devices are kept up-to-date
with the latest security patches, minimizing exposure to known
vulnerabilities.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create a comprehensive AUP that clearly outlines employee
responsibilities and acceptable behaviors regarding company IT
resources, data handling, and internet usage.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all employees read, understand, and formally acknowledge
the AUP, with regular reviews and updates to reflect evolving
organizational needs and threats.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Enhance Security Awareness Training Program:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Beyond initial onboarding, implement mandatory annual security
awareness training for all employees. This training should cover topics
such as phishing, social engineering, password hygiene, safe browsing,
and data protection best practices.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct regular simulated phishing campaigns to test employee
vigilance and provide immediate, targeted remedial training where
necessary.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Regular Vulnerability Assessments and Penetration
Tests:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Schedule periodic vulnerability assessments to proactively
identify new weaknesses and misconfigurations in the
infrastructure.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider engaging third-party experts for penetration testing to
simulate real-world attacks and identify complex vulnerabilities that
automated scans might miss.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The assessment reveals several significant areas where _name’s
cybersecurity posture requires immediate attention, particularly in the
adoption of Multi-Factor Authentication, comprehensive software
patching, and robust employee training and policies. Addressing these
critical gaps through the recommended actions will substantially reduce
the organization’s attack surface and improve its resilience against
current and evolving cyber threats. Continuous monitoring and a
proactive approach to security are essential for maintaining a strong
defensive posture.</p>
