<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, incorporating a
recent network scan, organizational security control review, and
existing risk data. The assessment aims to identify critical gaps,
technical vulnerabilities, and provide actionable recommendations to
enhance the organization’s security posture.</p>
<p>The network scan indicates a positive external security posture with
no open ports detected on the scanned target, potentially resolving
previously identified external-facing risks. However, a review of
organizational security controls reveals significant policy and training
deficiencies, particularly concerning Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
for sensitive data, the absence of an acceptable use policy, and lack of
security awareness training for new employees. A pre-existing risk
related to an unencrypted web server (Port 80) was noted, which appears
to be mitigated according to the recent scan results, requiring
verification.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-security-control-gaps">Analysis
of Security Control Gaps:</h2>
<p>The questionnaire reveals critical gaps in security practices that
could significantly increase the organization’s risk exposure:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> Lack of MFA on
systems handling sensitive data is a major vulnerability, increasing the
risk of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> The absence of an
AUP means employees may not be aware of their responsibilities regarding
IT asset usage, data handling, and security expectations, leading to
potential misuse or accidental breaches.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Security Awareness Training for New Employees:</strong>
Failing to train new employees immediately upon hire leaves a critical
window during which they are most susceptible to social engineering
attacks (e.g., phishing) and may inadvertently introduce risks.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed to identify open ports and services on
the specified target.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scanner:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Target IP/Hostname:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not provided in scan
metadata.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="scan-findings">Scan Findings:</h2>
<p>The Nmap scan results indicate that the host is currently
<strong>up</strong>, but <strong>no open ports were detected</strong>.
Specifically, port 80 was found to be <code>closed</code>. This is a
positive finding, as it significantly reduces the external attack
surface. No services, products, or versions were identified due to the
lack of open ports.</p>

<p><em>Note on "Unencrypted Web Server" Risk:</em> The recent network
scan (Input 1) explicitly found port 80 to be <code>closed</code>. This
contradicts the overview provided in the existing vulnerability data,
which states "Port 80 is open." It is highly probable that this risk has
been mitigated or was incorrectly recorded. Further verification is
recommended.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="identified-critical-gaps-and-high-risks">Identified Critical Gaps
and High Risks:</h2>
<p>Based on the security control review, the following represent
high-priority risks requiring immediate attention:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> This
exposes critical organizational data to compromise through credential
theft. Severity: <strong>High</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of Acceptable Use Policy:</strong> Without clear
guidelines, employees may engage in activities that inadvertently expose
the organization to legal, reputational, or security risks. Severity:
<strong>High</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong> New hires are often targets for social engineering.
Lack of initial training makes them vulnerable and a potential entry
point for attackers. Severity: <strong>High</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To strengthen the overall cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, the following recommendations are
provided:</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="immediate-actions-high-priority">Immediate
Actions (High Priority):</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong>
Mandate Multi-Factor Authentication for all systems that store, process,
or transmit sensitive organizational data. This significantly reduces
the risk of unauthorized access even if credentials are stolen.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a comprehensive AUP that clearly outlines
employee responsibilities, permitted and prohibited activities regarding
company IT resources, data handling, and internet usage. Ensure all
employees review and acknowledge the policy annually.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Onboarding Security Awareness
Training:</strong> Integrate mandatory security awareness training into
the onboarding process for all new employees. This training should cover
phishing, malware, password hygiene, data handling best practices, and
the importance of reporting suspicious activities.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="verification-and-continuous-improvement">Verification and Continuous
Improvement:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Verify Status of "Unencrypted Web Server" Risk:</strong>
Confirm that Port 80 is indeed closed and remains closed, or if it has
been replaced by a secure (HTTPS) service. Update the risk register
accordingly.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Security Awareness Training:</strong> Continue
with annual security awareness training for all employees, ensuring
content is updated to reflect current threat landscapes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Periodic Policy Review:</strong> Regularly review and
update all security policies (including the AUP) to ensure they remain
relevant and effective against evolving threats.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Comprehensive Vulnerability Management:</strong>
Implement a continuous vulnerability scanning and patch management
program to proactively identify and remediate technical vulnerabilities
across all systems.</p></li>
