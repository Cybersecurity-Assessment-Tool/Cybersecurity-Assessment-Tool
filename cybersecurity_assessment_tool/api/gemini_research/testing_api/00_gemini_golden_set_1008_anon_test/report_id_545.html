<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong> based on an analysis of provided
network scan data, organizational security questionnaire responses, and
a list of current identified risks. The objective is to identify
vulnerabilities, assess existing controls, and provide actionable
recommendations to enhance the overall security posture. This assessment
correlates technical findings with policy and procedural gaps to offer a
holistic view of potential threats and exposures.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following organizational details were used for this assessment.
Due to anonymization requirements, placeholders are used where specific
information was not provided in the input data.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Organization Name:</strong> <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong></p></li>

<li><p><strong>External IP Address / Target:</strong>
<code>[Client IP]</code></p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>The cybersecurity posture of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>
presents several critical areas for immediate improvement, primarily
revolving around access control and external exposure. A significant
finding is the public exposure of Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) on
<code>[Target IP]</code>, a critical service often targeted by
attackers. This is further exacerbated by the reported lack of
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across email, computer logins, and
sensitive data systems, leaving the organization highly vulnerable to
credential-based attacks. While the organization demonstrates a
commitment to security awareness training and acceptable use policies,
the fundamental technical and procedural gaps concerning RDP and MFA
pose an severe risk that requires urgent attention.</p>
<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A review of the organization’s security controls was conducted based
on responses to a key security questionnaire. This section highlights
the current state of critical security policies and implementations.</p>
<h2 id="questionnaire-responses">Questionnaire Responses</h2>
<p>The following table summarizes the responses received regarding
various security controls:</p>

</table>
<h2 id="analysis-of-gaps">Analysis of Gaps</h2>
<p>The questionnaire results reveal critical gaps in the implementation
of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all assessed critical access
points: email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems. The absence
of MFA significantly increases the risk of successful unauthorized
access due to compromised credentials, which are a primary vector for
cyberattacks. While the presence of an acceptable use policy and regular
security awareness training are positive, these measures are
substantially undermined by the lack of foundational MFA controls.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was conducted to identify open ports and services on
the target infrastructure. The scan metadata indicates the target was
unspecified at the time of the scan, thus a placeholder is used.</p>
<h2 id="scan-metadata">Scan Metadata</h2>

<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Used:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="identified-open-ports-and-services">Identified Open Ports and
Services</h2>
<p>The following open ports and services were identified during the
scan:</p>
<table>

<td style="text-align: left;">ms-wbt-server (Microsoft Remote Desktop
Protocol)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2 id="technical-analysis">Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>The most significant finding from the network scan is the exposure of
Port 3389, which is associated with Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol
(RDP). RDP is a common target for adversaries attempting to gain initial
access to an organization’s network, often through brute-force attacks
or exploiting known vulnerabilities in the RDP service. Given that the
questionnaire responses indicate a lack of MFA for computer logins, this
open port represents a critical entry point that is inadequately
protected. Without MFA, a successful compromise of RDP credentials
(which can be obtained through various means like phishing or credential
stuffing) would grant an attacker direct access to internal systems.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section integrates findings from the security control review and
technical scan results with pre-existing identified risks to provide a
comprehensive risk assessment.</p>
<h2 id="existing-vulnerabilities">Existing Vulnerabilities</h2>

</table>
<h2 id="correlated-risks-and-impact">Correlated Risks and Impact</h2>
<p>The analysis confirms and amplifies the severity of the "RDP
Exposure" risk.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Direct Confirmation:</strong> The network scan explicitly
identified RDP (Port 3389) as open, directly confirming the existing
"RDP Exposure" risk.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Exacerbated Severity:</strong> The critical severity of
9.0 (CVSS) for RDP Exposure is significantly heightened by the lack of
MFA across the organization’s critical access points (email, computer
logins, sensitive data systems). Without MFA, compromised RDP
credentials allow an attacker direct, unimpeded access to internal
systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Potential Impact:</strong> A successful RDP compromise
could lead to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Initial network access and lateral movement.</p></li>
<li><p>Data exfiltration.</p></li>
<li><p>Installation of malware, including ransomware.</p></li>
<li><p>Business disruption and financial loss.</p></li>
<li><p>Reputational damage.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Systemic Vulnerability:</strong> The absence of MFA
across multiple critical systems indicates a systemic vulnerability that
extends beyond just RDP, making the organization susceptible to various
forms of credential theft and account takeover attacks.</p></li>
</ul>
