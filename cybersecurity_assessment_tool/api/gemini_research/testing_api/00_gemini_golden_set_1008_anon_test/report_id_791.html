<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This document presents the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment for . The assessment was conducted by analyzing three primary
data sources: an external network scan, responses to a security
questionnaire, and a list of existing organizational risks. The
objective is to provide a clear understanding of the current security
landscape, highlight critical vulnerabilities and control deficiencies,
and offer pragmatic recommendations for improvement.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following organizational details were used for this assessment.

anonymized or marked as missing.</p>

<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A review of the organization’s security controls was conducted based
on responses to a provided questionnaire. The results are summarized
below, indicating compliance () or non-compliance () with standard
security practices.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-control-gaps">Analysis of Control Gaps</h2>
<p>The questionnaire revealed several critical gaps in security controls
and policies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Computer Login:</strong> The absence of
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer login significantly
increases the risk of unauthorized access if credentials are
compromised.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Missing Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong>
Without a formal AUP, there is a lack of clear guidelines for employee
behavior regarding IT resource usage, potentially leading to misuse,
data breaches, or legal complications.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong> New employees are particularly susceptible to social
engineering and phishing attacks without initial security awareness
training, increasing the organization’s overall risk exposure.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed to identify open ports and
services on the target system. The scan was performed with ‘nmap‘ but
the ‘scan_date‘ was not provided in the input data.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target Host:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Status:</strong> Up</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports Identified:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 22 (SSH):</strong> State: Open</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of Technical
Findings</h2>
<p>The presence of an open SSH (Port 22) service on the external network
warrants attention. While SSH itself is a legitimate service, it is a
frequent target for brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, and other
exploitation attempts. Without further information on the specific SSH
server version, configuration, or associated security controls (e.g.,
rate limiting, MFA for SSH), it represents a potential entry point for
attackers.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section consolidates the findings from the security control
review, technical scan, and pre-existing vulnerabilities to provide a
comprehensive risk overview. Severity is categorized as Critical, High,
Medium, or Low.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis, the following actionable recommendations are
provided to address identified risks and enhance the organization’s
cybersecurity posture:</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="immediate-actions-high-priority">Immediate
Actions (High Priority)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Address "Localhost Exposed" Vulnerability:</strong>
Prioritize investigation and remediation of the pre-existing "Localhost
Exposed" vulnerability. Given its critical severity (CVSS 10.0), this
should be the top security initiative.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Login:</strong> Deploy and
enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer logins across
the organization. This significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
access from stolen or weak credentials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mandatory Security Training for New Employees:</strong>
Establish and implement a mandatory security awareness training program
for all new employees during their onboarding process. This should cover
common threats like phishing, malware, and social engineering.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="strategic-initiatives-medium-priority">Strategic Initiatives (Medium
Priority)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create and formally implement a comprehensive AUP that
clearly outlines employee responsibilities and permissible use of
organizational IT resources. Ensure all employees acknowledge and
understand this policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Harden SSH Service Configuration:</strong> Review and
harden the configuration of the exposed SSH service on . This
includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Disabling password-based authentication in favor of key-based
authentication.</p></li>
<li><p>Implementing rate-limiting for failed login attempts.</p></li>
<li><p>Changing the default SSH port (though this is a deterrent, not a
security control).</p></li>
<li><p>Ensuring the SSH server is running the latest stable version and
is regularly patched.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider implementing MFA for SSH access if not already
present.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Vulnerability Scanning:</strong> Implement a
schedule for regular internal and external vulnerability scans to
proactively identify and remediate new technical weaknesses.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The cybersecurity posture assessment for reveals a critical need for
attention to foundational security controls and policy implementation.
While some areas show good practice (MFA for email and sensitive
systems, annual training), significant gaps in MFA for computer logins,
security awareness for new hires, and essential policies pose
considerable risk. Addressing the identified critical and high-severity
risks through the provided recommendations will be pivotal in
strengthening the organization’s defense against cyber threats.</p>
