<h2 id="analysis-of-questionnaire-findings">Analysis of Questionnaire
Findings</h2>
<p>The review of security controls highlights significant deficiencies
in critical areas, posing substantial risks to the organization:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> The complete
absence of MFA requirements for email access, computer logins, and
access to sensitive data systems is a severe vulnerability. This single
point of failure significantly increases the risk of successful
credential stuffing, phishing, and brute-force attacks, leading to
widespread unauthorized access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Security Awareness Training:</strong> The lack of both
initial (new employee) and recurring (annual) security awareness
training leaves the organization’s human element highly susceptible to
social engineering, phishing campaigns, and other human-centric attacks.
Employees are often the first line of defense, and without proper
training, they become the weakest link.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Acceptable Use Policy:</strong> The presence of an
acceptable use policy is a positive control, providing a foundational
guideline for appropriate employee conduct concerning IT assets and
data.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on <code>[Target IP]</code>. The scan
date information was not provided in the input data (N/A). The following
active services were identified:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP:</strong> <code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> N/A</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports and Services:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 22/tcp (Open):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Service:</strong> Unknown (Likely SSH - Secure
Shell)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Product:</strong> Unknown</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Version:</strong> Unknown</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Risk Comment:</strong> An open SSH port, while common for
legitimate remote administration, presents a potential attack vector if
not rigorously secured. Without specific version information, it is
impossible to determine if the service is running an outdated or known
vulnerable version. The presence of an open SSH port necessitates robust
hardening measures, including strong authentication methods (e.g.,
key-based authentication with passphrases), strict access controls
(limiting source IPs), disabling root login, and implementing rate
limiting.</p></li>

<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section summarizes the identified risks, categorized by their
potential impact and likelihood.</p>
<h2 id="identified-risks">Identified Risks</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Critical Risk: Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Overview:</strong> The complete absence of MFA across
email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems creates an extremely
high risk of successful credential-based attacks. This vulnerability can
lead to widespread data breaches, system compromise, and significant
operational disruption.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Severity:</strong> Critical</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>High Risk: Inadequate Security Awareness
Training</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Overview:</strong> Without regular and comprehensive
security awareness training for all employees, the organization is
highly vulnerable to social engineering attacks, phishing, and malware
dissemination. Human error resulting from a lack of awareness is a
leading cause of security incidents.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Medium Risk: Open SSH Port (Port 22/tcp) with
Undetermined Configuration</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Overview:</strong> An exposed SSH service without
detailed configuration or version information represents a potential
entry point for attackers. While not inherently critical, improper
configuration (e.g., weak passwords, root login enabled, outdated
software) can quickly escalate this into a high or critical risk,
allowing unauthorized remote access to the target system.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Severity:</strong> Medium (Potential to escalate to
High/Critical based on actual configuration)</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="pre-existing-vulnerabilities-review">Pre-existing
Vulnerabilities Review</h2>
<p>The provided input data (<code>Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON</code>)
indicated an empty list of vulnerabilities. Therefore, no pre-existing
vulnerabilities were incorporated into this assessment.</p>
