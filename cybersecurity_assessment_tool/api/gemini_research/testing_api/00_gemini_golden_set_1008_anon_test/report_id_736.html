<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides an assessment of the current cybersecurity
posture for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on an analysis
of provided organizational data, a targeted network scan, and a review
of existing risk information. The assessment reveals a mixed security
posture: the organization demonstrates commendable adherence to
foundational security practices such as comprehensive security awareness
training and a clear acceptable use policy. However, critical gaps were
identified concerning the implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) for email access and computer logins, which represent significant
vectors for compromise. The external network scan of the specified
target did not identify any immediately exploitable open ports,
indicating a potentially well-configured perimeter for the scanned
asset. Recommendations are provided to address identified
vulnerabilities and enhance overall security resilience.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed using Nmap. The target for
this scan was <code>[Target IP]</code>.</p>
<h2 id="nmap-scan-findings">Nmap Scan Findings</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target Host Status:</strong> Up</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports Identified:</strong> No open ports were
identified on the scanned target.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Summary:</strong> The Nmap scan of
<code>[Target IP]</code> did not reveal any open ports or externally
accessible services during the assessment period. This is a positive
finding, suggesting a well-configured perimeter firewall or host-based
firewall preventing direct external access to common network services.
It is important to note that this scan provides a snapshot of the
external attack surface and does not encompass internal network
vulnerabilities, web application vulnerabilities, or sophisticated
stealth scanning techniques.</p></li>

<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the correlation of the questionnaire responses, technical
scan results, and any pre-existing vulnerability data, the following key
risks have been identified:</p>

<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of MFA for Email Access</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The absence of Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) for email access significantly increases the risk of account
takeover via phishing, brute-force, or credential stuffing attacks.
Compromised email accounts can lead to business email compromise (BEC),
data exfiltration, and further network penetration.</td>

<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of MFA for Computer Login</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Without MFA for computer logins, attacker
access to internal systems is much easier once initial credentials are
compromised (e.g., via keyloggers, password spraying, or social
engineering). This provides a direct path to sensitive internal
resources and facilitates lateral movement within the network.</td>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To significantly enhance the cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, the following actionable
recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Access:</strong> Immediately
deploy and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email
accounts across the organization. This is a critical and highly
effective control against credential compromise and phishing
attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Login:</strong> Implement and
enforce MFA for all user logins to company computers and endpoints. This
will significantly strengthen endpoint security and prevent unauthorized
access to internal systems even if primary credentials are
stolen.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Internal Network Vulnerability
Assessment:</strong> While the external scan showed no open ports, an
internal vulnerability assessment would provide crucial insight into
potential weaknesses within the corporate network, including
misconfigurations, unpatched systems, and weak internal authentication
mechanisms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Consider Advanced External Penetration Testing:</strong>
An Nmap scan is a basic assessment. For a more thorough evaluation of
the external attack surface, consider a full external penetration test
that includes web application testing and advanced
reconnaissance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regularly Review and Update Security Policies:</strong>
Ensure that all security policies, including the Acceptable Use Policy,
are regularly reviewed and updated to reflect current threat landscapes,
technological changes, and regulatory requirements.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enhance Security Awareness Training with Phishing
Simulations:</strong> While training is in place, consider incorporating
regular, realistic phishing simulations to continuously test employee
vigilance and educate them on evolving social engineering
tactics.</p></li>
