<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on a recent network
scan, organizational security questionnaire responses, and a review of
current risks. The analysis identifies several critical areas requiring
immediate attention, primarily related to outdated software, significant
gaps in Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) implementation, and incomplete
security awareness training for new hires. While some foundational
controls are present, such as an acceptable use policy and annual
security training, the organization faces considerable exposure due to
the identified vulnerabilities and control deficiencies. Addressing
these items will substantially improve the overall security posture and
significantly reduce the risk of successful cyberattacks.</p>

<h2 id="key-findings-from-questionnaire">Key Findings from
Questionnaire:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA Gaps:</strong> Multi-Factor Authentication is not
required for email access or computer logins. This represents a
significant vulnerability, increasing the risk of credential-based
attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Training Deficiencies:</strong> New employees do not
receive immediate security awareness training upon hire. This gap means
new staff may be unaware of critical security policies and common
threats, increasing the likelihood of human error leading to security
incidents.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Positive Controls:</strong> The organization has an
employee acceptable use policy, conducts annual security awareness
training for all employees, and implements MFA for sensitive data
systems. These are positive foundational elements.</p></li>

<h2 id="technical-analysis">Technical Analysis:</h2>
<p>The Nginx web server running version 1.18.0 on port 443 (HTTPS) is
significantly outdated. Nginx 1.18.0 reached End-of-Life (EOL) in April
2021 and no longer receives security updates. This poses a
<strong>High</strong> risk as the server is likely vulnerable to
numerous publicly known exploits that have been patched in newer,
supported versions. Operating EOL software can lead to system
compromise, data breaches, and service disruption.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the security questionnaire, technical scan
results, and current risk register (which was empty), the following new
risks have been identified:</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and significantly enhance the
overall cybersecurity posture of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>,
the following actionable recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade and Patch Nginx Web Server:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediately plan and execute an upgrade
of the Nginx web server from version 1.18.0 to the latest stable and
supported version (e.g., Nginx 1.24.x or 1.26.x). Ensure thorough
testing in a staging environment before production deployment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> Running EOL software exposes the
organization to known vulnerabilities that will not receive official
patches, making exploitation highly probable.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Email
Access:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Deploy and enforce mandatory MFA for all
email accounts across the organization. This should be a top
priority.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> Email is a primary vector for
phishing, business email compromise (BEC), and credential theft. MFA
significantly reduces the risk of account compromise even if passwords
are stolen.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer
Logins:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Research, procure, and implement an MFA
solution for all computer logins (desktops, laptops, servers). Integrate
with existing identity management systems where feasible.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> MFA for computer logins protects
against unauthorized access to internal systems, lateral movement, and
privilege escalation, even if local or domain credentials are
compromised.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Enhance New Employee Security Awareness
Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop and implement a mandatory
security awareness training program for all new employees that must be
completed prior to receiving access to any organizational systems or
data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justification:</strong> Ensuring new employees are aware
of security policies, common threats (e.g., phishing), and best
practices from day one reduces the likelihood of human error and
increases overall organizational resilience.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The cybersecurity posture assessment for <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong> reveals that while some critical security controls are in
place, significant vulnerabilities exist due to outdated software and
critical gaps in MFA implementation and new employee training. The
identified high-severity risks, particularly concerning the outdated
Nginx server and the lack of MFA for email and computer logins, warrant
immediate attention. Proactive implementation of the recommended actions
will substantially strengthen the organization’s defenses against
prevalent cyber threats, reduce the attack surface, and enhance overall
resilience to cyberattacks.</p>
