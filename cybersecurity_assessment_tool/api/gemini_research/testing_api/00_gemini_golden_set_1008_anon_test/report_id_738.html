<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">1. Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details a cybersecurity posture assessment for
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, synthesizing data from a recent
network scan, organizational security questionnaire responses, and a
list of existing risks. The analysis reveals a generally positive stance
on security awareness training and acceptable use policies, but
identifies a critical vulnerability: the absence of multi-factor
authentication (MFA) for computer logins. Furthermore, a noteworthy
discrepancy was found between the current network scan results (Port 80
closed) and a previously documented risk of an unencrypted web server
(Port 80 open). This report provides actionable recommendations to
address these findings and enhance the overall security posture.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-security-controls">3.1 Analysis
of Security Controls</h2>
<p>The organization has implemented strong practices in employee
security awareness and policy enforcement, which are foundational
elements of a robust security program. However, the critical absence of
multi-factor authentication for logging into computers represents a
significant vulnerability. This gap dramatically increases the risk of
unauthorized access to internal systems if user credentials are
compromised, potentially leading to broader network compromise and data
exfiltration.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">6. Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the comprehensive analysis, the following recommendations
are provided to improve the cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="immediate-action-items">6.1 Immediate Action
Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Logins (High
Priority):</strong> It is critical to enforce multi-factor
authentication for all user logins to computers, especially those
accessing internal networks or sensitive data systems. This
significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access due to stolen or
weak credentials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Verify Port 80 Status and Address Historical
Risk:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Conduct an internal review to confirm the current state of Port
80. If it was previously open and is now closed, document the
remediation steps taken and confirm that no critical services were
unintentionally impacted.</p></li>
<li><p>If a web service is intended to be hosted, ensure it is migrated
to use HTTPS exclusively on Port 443, with robust TLS configurations,
and that Port 80 remains permanently closed.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="general-recommendations">6.2 General
Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Regular Vulnerability Scanning and Penetration
Testing:</strong> Implement a schedule for regular internal and external
vulnerability scanning to proactively identify and remediate potential
weaknesses. Consider periodic penetration tests to simulate real-world
attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Incident Response Plan Development/Review:</strong>
Ensure a comprehensive incident response plan is in place, regularly
reviewed, and tested through tabletop exercises to ensure the
organization can effectively detect, respond to, and recover from
security incidents.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Continuous Security Awareness Training
Enhancement:</strong> While currently conducting training, continuously
refresh and expand security awareness programs to cover emerging
threats, targeting specific roles and responsibilities within the
organization.</p></li>
