<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on a recent network scan,
organizational security questionnaire responses, and a review of
existing vulnerabilities. While the network scan found no immediate open
service vulnerabilities on the designated target, critical gaps were
identified in security controls, notably the absence of Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for sensitive data systems and a lack of
comprehensive security awareness training. An existing vulnerability,
"Unencrypted Web Server," was noted; however, the recent scan indicated
Port 80 was closed on the specified target, suggesting a potential
mitigation or scope difference requiring further investigation.
Addressing these identified gaps is crucial for enhancing the
organization’s overall security posture and reducing its attack
surface.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the assessment, the following recommendations are provided
to enhance the cybersecurity posture of <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Sensitive
Data Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mandate MFA for all access to systems containing sensitive
organizational data. This critical control will significantly reduce the
risk of unauthorized access even if primary credentials are
compromised.</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluate and implement appropriate MFA solutions, such as
hardware tokens, authenticator apps, or biometrics.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish a Comprehensive Security Awareness Training
Program:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and implement mandatory security awareness training for
all new employees as part of their onboarding process.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct mandatory annual security awareness training for all
employees to keep them updated on current threats (e.g., phishing,
ransomware) and reinforce best practices.</p></li>
<li><p>Incorporate regular simulated phishing exercises to test employee
vigilance and training effectiveness.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Investigate "Unencrypted Web Server" Discrepancy and
Remediate if Applicable:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Thoroughly investigate why the "Unencrypted Web Server" risk
(from Input 3) shows Port 80 as open, while the recent network scan
(Input 1) found it <code>closed</code> on
<code>[Target IP]</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>If Port 80 was indeed closed on the target, document this
mitigation and update the risk register accordingly.</p></li>
<li><p>If the risk pertains to other assets not covered by the recent
scan, identify all unencrypted web services (HTTP on Port 80) across the
organization’s infrastructure.</p></li>
<li><p>For any identified unencrypted web servers, migrate them to
HTTPS, enforcing the use of valid SSL/TLS certificates and robust
encryption protocols. All public-facing web services should utilize
HTTPS exclusively.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Security Scans and Vulnerability
Management:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement a schedule for regular internal and external network
vulnerability scans to proactively identify and address potential
weaknesses, misconfigurations, and outdated software.</p></li>
<li><p>Establish a formal vulnerability management program to track,
prioritize, and remediate identified vulnerabilities in a timely
manner.</p></li>
</ul></li>
