<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-questionnaire-responses">2.1
Analysis of Questionnaire Responses</h2>
<p>The questionnaire responses highlight several critical security
weaknesses:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA Gaps:</strong> The lack of Multi-Factor
Authentication for email and general computer logins significantly
elevates the risk of account compromise. This makes the organization
highly susceptible to common attacks such as phishing, credential
stuffing, and brute-force attempts. While MFA for sensitive data systems
is a positive, the broader absence creates a substantial initial attack
surface.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>New Employee Training Deficit:</strong> The absence of
mandatory security awareness training for new employees is a significant
vulnerability. New hires are often prime targets for social engineering
attacks due to unfamiliarity with organizational policies, common threat
vectors, and secure practices. This increases the likelihood of
incidents from day one.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">3. Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>A limited network scan was performed to identify open ports and
services on the target system. Due to the anonymized and minimal nature
of the input, the full scope of a typical Nmap scan was not
available.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not provided in the input
data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Used:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> The target host was reported as
"up".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports Identified:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 22/TCP:</strong> Open. This port is commonly
associated with SSH (Secure Shell), a protocol used for secure remote
access.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Note:</em> Critical information such as service name,
product, and version was not provided in the scan data for port 22. This
omission significantly limits the ability to assess specific
vulnerabilities related to the running service.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-technical-scan-results">3.1
Analysis of Technical Scan Results</h2>
<p>The presence of an open port 22 (SSH) without accompanying service or
version information presents a potential, unquantified risk. While SSH
is a secure protocol when properly configured, an exposed SSH service
can be a target for brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or
exploits targeting unpatched vulnerabilities in the SSH daemon (e.g.,
OpenSSH). The lack of detailed service information prevents a deeper
analysis of specific software-related vulnerabilities or outdated
versions, which itself is a finding indicating either a basic scan or
incomplete data.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment">4. Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section consolidates all identified risks from the
questionnaire, the technical scan, and the pre-existing vulnerability
data. Risks are categorized by their severity and potential impact.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">5. Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actionable recommendations are provided to address the
identified security gaps and mitigate the associated risks.
Prioritization is based on the severity and potential impact of each
finding.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="immediate-remediation-high-priority">5.1
Immediate Remediation (High Priority)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Access:</strong> Immediately
deploy and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication for all email accounts
across the organization. This is a critical and highly effective control
against phishing, credential stuffing, and account takeover
attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Logins:</strong> Require
Multi-Factor Authentication for all user and administrative logins to
workstations, servers, and other critical computing resources. This
significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access stemming from
compromised credentials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Address "Localhost Exposed" Vulnerability:</strong>
Investigate and remediate the "Localhost Exposed" vulnerability (CVSS
10.0) as a matter of extreme urgency. This will likely involve
reconfiguring network access controls, firewall rules, or application
bindings to ensure sensitive services are not publicly accessible or
exposed beyond their intended scope. This vulnerability represents an
immediate and severe threat.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="mid-term-improvements-medium-priority">5.2
Mid-Term Improvements (Medium Priority)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Initiate Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong> Establish a mandatory and comprehensive security
awareness training program for all new hires. This training should be
completed before granting access to critical systems and cover topics
such as phishing, malware, strong password practices, and adherence to
organizational security policies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Harden SSH Service on <code>[Target IP]</code>:</strong>
For the identified open SSH port 22:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Restrict SSH access to known, trusted source IP addresses or
subnets using firewall rules.</p></li>
<li><p>Disable password-based authentication in favor of more secure
key-based authentication.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement rate-limiting for SSH connection attempts to mitigate
brute-force attacks.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure the SSH daemon is regularly patched and updated to the
latest stable version.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider changing the default SSH port (22) to a non-standard
port if appropriate for the environment and doesn’t hinder legitimate
operations.</p></li>
<li><p>Deploy an Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (IDS/IPS) to
monitor for malicious SSH activity.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Detailed Penetration Testing:</strong> Perform a
comprehensive penetration test focusing on network services, web
applications, and internal systems to further identify and validate
vulnerabilities, especially those related to the open SSH port and the
"Localhost Exposed" finding. This will provide deeper insight into
potential attack paths.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="long-term-strategy-ongoing">5.3 Long-Term
Strategy (Ongoing)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Regular Vulnerability Management Program:</strong>
Implement a continuous vulnerability scanning and management program
across all assets. This includes regular internal and external scans,
patch management, and a formal process for tracking and remediating
identified vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Security Policy Review and Enhancement:</strong>
Periodically review and update all security policies, including the
acceptable use policy, data handling policies, and incident response
plans, to ensure they remain relevant, effective, and align with current
threat landscapes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Continuous Employee Training and Awareness:</strong>
Continue annual security awareness training for all employees.
Additionally, consider more frequent, targeted training modules for
specific roles (e.g., privileged users) or in response to new threat
trends (e.g., specific phishing campaigns).</p></li>
