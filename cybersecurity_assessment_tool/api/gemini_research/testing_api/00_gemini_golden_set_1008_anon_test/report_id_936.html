<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report outlines the current cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong> based on the provided data inputs.
A review of the organizational security questionnaire revealed several
critical gaps, notably the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
sensitive data systems, the absence of an employee acceptable use
policy, and insufficient annual security awareness training for all
employees. These gaps represent significant risks that could lead to
unauthorized access, policy violations, and increased susceptibility to
social engineering attacks.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the provided network scan data
(Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON) and existing risk register data
(Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON) were malformed or incomplete, preventing a
comprehensive technical analysis of external-facing services or an
assessment of pre-existing vulnerabilities. Therefore, the findings in
this report are primarily derived from the organizational questionnaire.
Immediate action is recommended to address the identified policy and
control deficiencies to mitigate associated risks.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>The provided Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON was malformed or incomplete,
preventing a comprehensive technical analysis of network services, open
ports, and potential vulnerabilities. Therefore, no specific technical
scan findings can be reported at this time. The intended target IP
address for the scan was identified as <code>[Target IP]</code>, but no
scan data was successfully parsed. A successful and complete scan is
crucial for identifying external-facing vulnerabilities.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the security questionnaire, several critical
risks have been identified due to unimplemented security controls. The
unavailability of network scan results and existing risk data
(Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON was malformed) means that this section
primarily focuses on these identified policy and control gaps.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and enhance the cybersecurity posture
of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, the following recommendations
are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems</strong>:
Mandate and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all access to
systems containing sensitive organizational or client data. This
significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access even if primary
credentials are compromised.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP)</strong>: Create a comprehensive AUP that clearly defines the
rules and expectations for employee use of organizational IT resources,
including email, internet, software, and hardware. Ensure all employees
review and acknowledge the AUP annually.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Annual Security Awareness Training</strong>:
Implement a mandatory, recurring security awareness training program for
all employees, conducted at least once per year. This training should
cover topics such as phishing, social engineering, password hygiene,
data handling, and reporting suspicious activities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct a Comprehensive Network Vulnerability
Scan</strong>: Re-run the network scan with validated and correct input
data to identify any open ports, exposed services, or known
vulnerabilities on external-facing assets. Prioritize remediation of any
critical or high-severity findings.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Maintain a Current Risk Register</strong>: Establish and
maintain a comprehensive risk register that tracks identified
vulnerabilities, associated risks, their severity, and remediation
progress. Ensure all identified risks are regularly reviewed and
updated.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These recommendations, once implemented, will significantly improve
the organization’s defensive capabilities against common cyber threats
and strengthen its overall security posture.</p>
