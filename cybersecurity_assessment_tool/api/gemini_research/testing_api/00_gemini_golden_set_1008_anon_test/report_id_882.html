<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report presents a cybersecurity posture assessment for ,
analyzing organizational security controls, network scan results, and
pre-existing vulnerabilities. The assessment reveals a mixed security
posture. Strengths include the implementation of Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins, along with
consistent security awareness training. However, critical gaps exist,
notably the absence of MFA for sensitive data systems and a formal
employee acceptable use policy.</p>
<p>A network scan targeting indicated no open ports, which is a positive
finding. Nevertheless, a pre-existing vulnerability concerning an
unencrypted web server on Port 80 requires verification against this
latest scan data. Addressing the identified gaps and vulnerabilities is
crucial for enhancing the organization’s resilience against cyber
threats.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> While the recent network scan of did not identify any
open ports, the presence of “Unencrypted Web Server” in pre-existing
vulnerabilities (which states “Port 80 is open.”) highlights a potential
discrepancy or an issue that may have since been remediated. It is
strongly recommended to verify the current status of this specific
finding to ensure effective remediation.</p>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following recommendations are provided to address the identified
critical gaps and vulnerabilities, thereby enhancing the overall
security posture of . These recommendations are categorized for
immediate action and long-term strategic initiatives.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="immediate-actions">Immediate Actions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong>
Immediately deploy and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all
access points to sensitive data systems. This is a critical control
against unauthorized access and credential compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create, disseminate, and enforce a comprehensive
Acceptable Use Policy for all employees. This policy should clearly
define expectations for appropriate technology usage, data handling, and
prohibited activities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Verify Unencrypted Web Server Status:</strong> Thoroughly
investigate the current status of the previously identified “Unencrypted
Web Server” vulnerability (Port 80). If the server is indeed closed as
indicated by the latest scan, document the remediation. If it remains
active (e.g., for internal-only services not covered by the external
scan), ensure it is promptly configured with HTTPS/TLS encryption and
necessary access controls.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="long-term-strategic-initiatives">Long-Term
Strategic Initiatives</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Regular Security Audits and Penetration Tests:</strong>
Establish a schedule for regular, independent security audits and
penetration tests. This proactive measure helps in continuously
identifying and addressing new or evolving vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Continuous Policy Review and Updates:</strong>
Periodically review and update all organizational security policies,
including the AUP, data retention policies, and MFA requirements. Ensure
these policies remain current with industry best practices, regulatory
requirements, and the evolving threat landscape.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Advanced Security Awareness Training:</strong> Maintain
and evolve the security awareness training program beyond basic
onboarding. Implement advanced training modules for specific roles and
simulations (e.g., phishing exercises) to reinforce secure behaviors and
educate employees on emerging threats.</p></li>
