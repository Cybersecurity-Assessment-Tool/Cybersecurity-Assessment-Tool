<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">1. Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings from a limited cybersecurity posture
assessment. Based on the provided network scan data, no open network
ports were identified on the target, suggesting a minimal external
network attack surface at the time of the scan. Furthermore, no
pre-existing vulnerabilities were documented in the provided data.
However, a critical review of the organization’s security controls,
informed by a questionnaire, reveals several significant policy and
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) gaps that considerably elevate the
overall risk profile. Key areas requiring immediate attention include
the urgent implementation of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data
systems, as well as the establishment of foundational security policies
and dedicated training for new employees. Addressing these identified
gaps is crucial for enhancing the organization’s defensive capabilities
against common cyber threats.</p>

Analysis of Security Control Gaps</h2>
<p>The questionnaire responses clearly reveal several critical gaps in
the organization’s foundational security posture, which introduce
notable risks:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Computer Login:</strong> The absence of
Multi-Factor Authentication for computer logins significantly increases
the risk of unauthorized access to internal systems. If an attacker
compromises a user’s password, the lack of a second authentication
factor provides no additional barrier to entry.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> Failure
to enforce MFA on systems that house sensitive organizational or
customer data represents a severe vulnerability. This oversight directly
increases the likelihood of a data breach and potential non-compliance
with data protection regulations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong>
Without a formal AUP, employees may lack clear guidelines regarding the
responsible use of company assets, data, and networks. This ambiguity
can lead to unintentional misuse, security incidents, and difficulties
in enforcing cybersecurity standards.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong> New hires are frequently targeted by social
engineering attacks (e.g., phishing). The lack of initial, mandatory
security awareness training leaves them highly susceptible, thereby
introducing a significant human element risk to the entire organization
from day one.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">4. Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>The provided network scan data from an Nmap scan was analyzed to
assess the external network attack surface.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not available in input data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Tool:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="network-port-scan-findings">4.1. Network Port
Scan Findings</h2>
<p>The Nmap scan indicated no open ports on the target system, with all
‘extraports‘ explicitly reported as ‘closed‘. This finding suggests a
minimal external attack surface from the perspective of directly
exploitable network services at the time the scan was conducted. While
this is a positive indicator for perimeter security against basic
port-scanning attacks, it is crucial to understand that a lack of open
ports does not equate to comprehensive security. Other attack vectors,
such as vulnerabilities within web applications, social engineering
tactics, or internal network weaknesses, may still exist and are not
covered by this type of scan. No specific service versions or products
could be identified due to the absence of open ports.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment">5. Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the comprehensive analysis of the security questionnaire,
and correlating with the technical scan results and the absence of
pre-existing vulnerabilities, the following risks have been

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">6. Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actionable recommendations are provided to address the
identified risks and significantly improve the overall cybersecurity
posture of the organization. Prioritizing these steps will help to build
a more resilient defense against current and future cyber threats.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="immediate-actions-high-priority">6.1.
Immediate Actions (High Priority)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Login (Addressing
R-001):</strong> Deploy and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication for all
user accounts accessing organizational computers and internal systems.
This crucial step creates a strong barrier against credential theft and
significantly reduces the impact of compromised passwords.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems (Addressing
R-002):</strong> Mandate MFA for all access to systems containing
sensitive organizational or customer data. Prioritize the rollout based
on data classification, system criticality, and regulatory requirements
to protect the most valuable assets first.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="policy-training-enhancements-medium-priority">6.2. Policy &amp;
Training Enhancements (Medium Priority)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce an Acceptable Use Policy (Addressing
R-003):</strong> Create a clear, comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use
Policy (AUP) that explicitly outlines expectations for appropriate use
of company assets, networks, and data. Ensure all employees read,
understand, and formally acknowledge this policy annually, with
disciplinary actions for non-compliance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Security Awareness Training for New Employees
(Addressing R-004):</strong> Establish a mandatory security awareness
training program as a critical component of the onboarding process for
all new hires. This training should cover common cyber threats (e.g.,
phishing, malware, social engineering), company security policies, and
best practices for protecting information.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="continuous-improvement-initiatives">6.3.
Continuous Improvement Initiatives</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Regular Vulnerability Assessments:</strong> While the
current scan indicated no open ports, this is a point-in-time
assessment. Implement a program of regular vulnerability scans and,
periodically, penetration tests across the entire IT infrastructure
(network, applications, cloud environments) to identify potential
weaknesses proactively.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Review and Update Policies Regularly:</strong> Establish
a schedule for periodically reviewing and updating all security policies
and procedures (including the AUP) to ensure they remain relevant,
effective, and aligned with evolving industry best practices, new
technologies, and regulatory changes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ongoing Security Awareness Training:</strong> Continue
with annual security awareness training for all employees and consider
implementing more frequent, targeted training sessions on emerging
threats or specific organizational risks identified throughout the
year.</p></li>
