<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This report presents a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The evaluation leverages data
from a security control questionnaire, a network vulnerability scan, and
a review of documented organizational risks. The objective is to
identify existing vulnerabilities and control gaps, and to provide
actionable recommendations to enhance the overall security posture and
reduce potential attack vectors.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-questionnaire-findings">Analysis of Questionnaire
Findings</h2>
<p>The questionnaire responses highlight significant weaknesses in key
security areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA Gaps:</strong> While MFA is correctly implemented for
email access, its absence for computer logins and sensitive data systems
poses a severe risk. This leaves internal systems and critical data
highly vulnerable to credential theft attacks (e.g., phishing,
brute-force, malware-based credential extraction).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inconsistent Security Awareness Training:</strong> The
lack of mandatory annual security awareness training for all employees
means that personnel may not be regularly updated on current threats,
best practices, and organizational policies. This significantly
increases susceptibility to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing,
pretexting) and human error, which are leading causes of security
incidents.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on <code>[Target IP]</code> on November
22, 2025. The scan focused on identifying open ports and associated
services to uncover potential vulnerabilities.</p>
<h2 id="summary-of-findings">Summary of Findings</h2>
<p>The scan revealed the following open port and service:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 443/TCP (HTTPS):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Service:</strong> HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol
Secure)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Product:</strong> Nginx</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.18.0</p></li>
<li><p><strong>State:</strong> Open</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of Technical
Findings</h2>
<p>The most significant finding from the network scan is the presence of
an Nginx web server running version 1.18.0. Nginx 1.18.0 was released in
April 2020. As of the assessment date (November 2025), this version is
severely outdated and no longer receives security updates or bug fixes.
Running outdated software, especially on public-facing services like a
web server, exposes the organization to numerous known vulnerabilities
that threat actors can easily exploit. These vulnerabilities could lead
to unauthorized access, website defacement, data exfiltration, or the
establishment of a foothold for further attacks into the internal
network.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the security questionnaire and the technical
scan results, the following risks have been identified:</p>

<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data
Systems</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The absence of MFA on systems handling

service to known vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers to
gain unauthorized access, deface the website, or launch further
attacks.</td>

</div>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and significantly improve the overall
cybersecurity posture, the following actionable recommendations are
provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Logins:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Mandate and implement Multi-Factor
Authentication for all user accounts logging into organizational
computers, workstations, and internal network resources.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> High</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rationale:</strong> MFA significantly reduces the risk of
unauthorized access even if primary credentials are stolen, forming a
critical layer of defense.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Deploy and enforce Multi-Factor
Authentication for access to all systems and applications containing or
processing sensitive organizational and customer data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> Critical</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Protecting sensitive data with MFA is
paramount to prevent data breaches, comply with regulations, and
maintain trust.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Mandatory Annual Security Awareness
Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop and implement a comprehensive,
mandatory annual security awareness training program for all employees.
This training should cover current threats, phishing recognition, data
handling best practices, password hygiene, and organizational security
policies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> High</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rationale:</strong> A well-informed workforce is the
first line of defense against social engineering and human-error related
security incidents.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade/Patch Nginx Web Server:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediately upgrade the Nginx web server
from version 1.18.0 to the latest stable and supported version (e.g., a
current stable branch like 1.24.x or newer). Prioritize this upgrade as
the service is public-facing and highly vulnerable.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> High</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Upgrading ensures that known
vulnerabilities in older versions are mitigated and the server benefits
from ongoing security patches and performance improvements.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The cybersecurity posture assessment for <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong> reveals a critical need for immediate remediation. The
lack of pervasive Multi-Factor Authentication and inconsistent security
awareness training represent significant internal control deficiencies.
Coupled with an outdated, public-facing web server, these issues present
substantial avenues for compromise. Adhering to the provided
recommendations will significantly strengthen <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong>’s defenses against common cyber threats, reduce its
overall risk exposure, and move towards a more robust and resilient
security posture. Proactive implementation of these controls is
essential to protect organizational assets and maintain operational
integrity.</p>
