<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, synthesizing data from a
security questionnaire, network scan results, and pre-existing risk
records. The assessment reveals several critical and high-priority
findings that require immediate attention to enhance the organization’s
security posture.</p>
<p>Key findings include the confirmed exposure of a Remote Desktop
Protocol (RDP) service, which is a significant critical vulnerability.
Furthermore, the analysis of security controls identified two major
gaps: the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing
sensitive data systems and the absence of a formal Employee Acceptable
Use Policy (AUP). While the organization demonstrates strengths in other
areas like email/computer MFA and regular security awareness training,
these identified risks present substantial avenues for potential
compromise or operational disruption.</p>
<p>Detailed recommendations are provided to address each identified
risk, ranging from technical mitigations for RDP exposure to policy
implementation for MFA and AUP. Adherence to these recommendations will
significantly strengthen the organization’s defenses and improve its
overall security resilience.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Analysis of Questionnaire Responses:</strong> The
organization has implemented Multi-Factor Authentication for email and
computer logins and maintains consistent security awareness training
programs, which are commendable practices. However, two critical gaps
were identified:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> The
absence of MFA for sensitive data systems significantly increases the
risk of unauthorized access if credentials are compromised, as it
provides a single point of failure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong>
Without an AUP, there is a lack of clear guidelines for employees
regarding the proper and secure use of organizational IT resources,
which can lead to inadvertent security incidents, data leakage, or
non-compliance.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was conducted to identify open ports and active
services on the specified target.</p>

<p><strong>Findings from Scan:</strong> The scan identified the
following open port and associated service:</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Analysis of Technical Scan:</strong> The discovery of an open
Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) service (port 3389) is a critical finding.
RDP, when exposed directly to the internet without robust protective
measures (such as VPNs, IP whitelisting, or gateway solutions), is a
frequent target for malicious actors. It is often exploited through
brute-force attacks to gain initial access to systems, which can lead to
further network penetration and data breaches. This finding confirms a
pre-existing vulnerability identified in the organization’s risk
register.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section consolidates all identified risks, combining
pre-existing vulnerabilities with those discovered through the
questionnaire analysis and technical scans. Each risk is assigned a
severity level to aid in prioritization.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following actionable recommendations are provided to address the
identified risks and enhance the overall cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. These actions are prioritized
based on the severity of the associated risk.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Mitigate RDP Exposure (Critical Risk)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Action:</strong> If RDP access is not
absolutely essential for external use, port 3389 should be immediately
closed or blocked at the network perimeter (firewall).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Long-Term Solution (if RDP is required):</strong>
Implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution to ensure that RDP
resources are only accessible after establishing a secure VPN
connection. This eliminates direct internet exposure. As an alternative,
strictly whitelist trusted source IP addresses allowed to connect to
RDP.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all RDP accounts utilize strong, unique passwords and
consider implementing network-level authentication (NLA) and account
lockout policies to deter brute-force attempts.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems (High
Risk)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Conduct an inventory of all systems and applications that store,
process, or transmit sensitive organizational data.</p></li>
<li><p>Mandate and implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all
user access to these identified sensitive data systems. This additional
layer of security significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access,
even in cases of password compromise.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide comprehensive training and support to users on the
importance and proper use of MFA for these critical systems.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP) (Medium Risk)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Draft a comprehensive Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) that
clearly outlines the acceptable and prohibited uses of company IT
assets, networks, and data. This policy should cover areas such as
password hygiene, data handling, internet browsing, email usage, and the
use of personal devices for work.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all employees review, understand, and formally acknowledge
the AUP, ideally upon hiring and annually thereafter, or whenever the
policy is updated.</p></li>
<li><p>Integrate AUP training into both new employee onboarding
processes and ongoing annual security awareness programs to reinforce
its importance and ensure compliance.</p></li>
</ul></li>
