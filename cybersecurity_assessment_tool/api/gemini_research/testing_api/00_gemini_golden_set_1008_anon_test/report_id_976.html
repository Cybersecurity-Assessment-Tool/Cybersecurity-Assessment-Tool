<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides an assessment of the current cybersecurity
posture for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on an
organizational security questionnaire and an external network scan. The
analysis reveals significant foundational control gaps, particularly
concerning Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) implementation across
critical access points and the absence of essential security policies
and new employee training. While the external network scan identified no
open ports on the scanned target, indicating a potentially secure
perimeter, the internal control deficiencies present a high risk of
unauthorized access, data breaches, and operational disruption. Urgent
recommendations include the immediate implementation of MFA, development
of an Acceptable Use Policy, and comprehensive security awareness
training for new employees to address these critical
vulnerabilities.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-control-gaps">Analysis of Control
Gaps:</h2>
<p>The questionnaire responses reveal several significant security
deficiencies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> The
absence of MFA across email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems
represents a critical vulnerability. This significantly increases the
risk of unauthorized access should employee credentials be compromised
through phishing, malware, or other means.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> Without
a formal AUP, employees lack clear guidelines regarding the appropriate
use of organizational IT resources, data handling, and internet
browsing. This can lead to increased risks of data leakage, malware
infections, and compliance issues.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inadequate New Employee Security Training:</strong>
Failing to provide security awareness training to new employees means
that new hires are immediately a potential security risk, susceptible to
common social engineering tactics and unaware of organizational security
best practices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Partial Security Awareness Training:</strong> While
annual training for all employees is commendable, the lack of specific
training for new employees introduces an initial vulnerability
period.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">3. Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed using Nmap.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not provided</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Status:</strong> The host was reported as
"up".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports:</strong> No open ports were identified. The
scan indicated that all extra ports scanned were "closed".</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="technical-analysis">Technical Analysis:</h2>
<p>The Nmap scan results indicate a robust external perimeter for the
scanned target, as no open ports were found. This suggests that the
target host is either well-hardened against external access or does not
expose services on commonly scanned ports. However, it is crucial to
remember that this finding only reflects the external posture of the
specific target and does not negate internal vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>This section synthesizes findings from the security control review
and technical scans, correlating them with existing organizational
risks. No pre-existing vulnerabilities were provided in the input

access, computer logins, and sensitive data systems (e.g., cloud
platforms, internal databases, critical applications).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Significantly reduces the risk of
unauthorized access due to stolen or weak credentials, a leading cause
of data breaches.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) (High
Priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Create a comprehensive AUP that clearly
outlines employee responsibilities for technology usage, data handling,
internet browsing, and security practices. Ensure all employees
acknowledge and adhere to the policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Establishes clear boundaries for
employee behavior, reduces insider threats, minimizes misuse of
resources, and helps ensure compliance with relevant
regulations.</p></li>
