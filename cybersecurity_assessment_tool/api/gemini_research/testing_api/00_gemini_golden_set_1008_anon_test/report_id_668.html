<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings from a cybersecurity posture
assessment conducted for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The
assessment involved reviewing organizational security controls based on
a questionnaire, analyzing network scan data, and evaluating existing
risk documentation.</p>
<p>Key findings indicate critical gaps in Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) enforcement for email access and the absence of a formal Employee
Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). An open HTTP port 80 was also identified,
which represents a potential security concern if not properly secured
with HTTPS redirection. Furthermore, one declared risk was provided
within the existing documentation, with a noted minimal severity.</p>
<p>Based on these findings, immediate recommendations include
implementing MFA for email, developing and enforcing a comprehensive
AUP, and reviewing the necessity and secure configuration of the open
HTTP port. Addressing these areas will significantly enhance the
organization’s overall security posture.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-questionnaire-gaps">Analysis of Questionnaire
Gaps</h2>
<p>The following critical gaps were identified based on the "No"
responses to the security questionnaire:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Email Access:</strong> This represents a
significant security vulnerability. Email accounts are primary targets
for phishing and credential stuffing attacks. Without MFA, compromised
email credentials can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive
information, Business Email Compromise (BEC) scams, and further lateral
movement within the network.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> An AUP is a fundamental document for establishing clear
guidelines on the appropriate and secure use of organizational IT
resources. Its absence can lead to inconsistent employee behavior,
increased risk of data breaches, malware infections, and potential legal
liabilities due due to misuse of company assets.</p></li>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>

<h2 id="technical-analysis">Technical Analysis</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Open Port 80 (HTTP):</strong> The presence of an open
HTTP port (80) indicates that a web server or application is listening
for unencrypted traffic. While an open port itself is not necessarily a
vulnerability, relying solely on HTTP for web traffic poses several
risks:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Data in Transit Vulnerability:</strong> Information
exchanged over HTTP (e.g., login credentials, sensitive data) is not
encrypted and can be easily intercepted and read by malicious actors
using tools like Wireshark.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Integrity:</strong> HTTP traffic offers no
inherent guarantees against tampering, meaning data could be altered in
transit without detection.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Increased Attack Surface:</strong> An exposed web service
on port 80, particularly if not properly secured or configured to
redirect to HTTPS, can be a target for various web-based attacks (e.g.,
cross-site scripting, SQL injection, directory traversal).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is a cybersecurity best practice to serve all web content
exclusively over HTTPS (port 443) using valid SSL/TLS certificates,
ensuring encryption and integrity, and implementing redirects for all
HTTP traffic. No specific service, product, or version information for
the service on port 80 was available from the provided scan output for
further analysis.</p></li>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the assessment findings, the following actionable
recommendations are provided to enhance <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong>’s cybersecurity posture:</p>
<h2 id="immediate-actions-high-priority">Immediate Actions (High
Priority)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Access:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Enable and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all user
accounts accessing organizational email. This should be a mandatory
requirement for all personnel.</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluate and deploy an MFA solution compatible with the
organization’s existing email infrastructure and user experience
requirements.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create a comprehensive AUP that clearly outlines expected
employee behavior regarding the secure and appropriate use of company IT
assets, internet, email, and sensitive data.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure the AUP is formally approved, distributed to all
employees, and that signed acknowledgments are obtained. Integrate AUP
review into new employee onboarding and regular security awareness
training.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Review and Secure Open Port 80 (HTTP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Determine the business necessity of the service(s) currently
running on port 80.</p></li>
<li><p>If a web service is required, configure it to exclusively use
HTTPS (port 443) with a valid SSL/TLS certificate issued by a trusted
Certificate Authority. Implement HTTP to HTTPS redirects to ensure all
traffic is encrypted.</p></li>
<li><p>If the service on port 80 is not required for external access,
disable or restrict access to port 80 at the network firewall
level.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="general-security-best-practices-ongoing">General Security Best
Practices (Ongoing)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Regular Security Awareness Training:</strong> Continue
and expand existing security awareness training programs to cover
current and emerging threats, advanced phishing techniques, social
engineering tactics, and updates to organizational security
policies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Patch Management Program:</strong> Establish and maintain
a robust patch management program to ensure all operating systems,
applications, and network devices are regularly updated with the latest
security patches to protect against known vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Incident Response Plan Development:</strong> Develop,
document, and regularly test a comprehensive incident response plan to
ensure the organization can effectively detect, respond to, and recover
from potential security incidents in a timely and organized
manner.</p></li>
