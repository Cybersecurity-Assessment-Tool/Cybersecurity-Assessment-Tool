<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity assessment
conducted for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The assessment
involved reviewing organizational security controls via a questionnaire,
analyzing network scan results, and incorporating existing vulnerability
data.</p>
<p>Key findings indicate significant areas for improvement across
several security domains. A critical Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
service was found openly exposed, coinciding with a pre-existing
high-severity risk. Furthermore, fundamental security controls such as
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and sensitive data systems
are not universally implemented. Crucially, foundational elements like
an acceptable use policy and regular security awareness training are
currently lacking, increasing the overall risk profile of the
organization.</p>
<p>The recommendations outlined in this report provide actionable steps
to mitigate identified risks, enhance the organization’s security
posture, and establish a more robust defense against cyber threats.</p>

<p><strong>Analysis of Gaps:</strong> The review highlights significant
deficiencies in foundational security practices. The lack of MFA for
email and sensitive data systems dramatically increases the risk of
unauthorized access and data breaches from credential compromise.
Furthermore, the absence of an employee acceptable use policy and
security awareness training for both new and existing employees
indicates a high human factor risk, making the organization susceptible
to social engineering, phishing attacks, and insider threats.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was conducted to identify publicly
accessible services and potential vulnerabilities. The scan targeted
.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not provided in scan
metadata.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Target Host Status:</strong> Up</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports and Services:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 3389/TCP:</strong> Open (Service:
<code>ms-wbt-server</code> - Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol)</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Technical Analysis:</strong> The primary technical finding is
the open Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) service on port 3389. RDP, when
exposed directly to the internet without proper protective measures
(such as VPN or strong MFA), is a frequent target for attackers
attempting brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, and exploiting
known vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access. While MFA is reported
for computer logins, its absence for sensitive data systems raises
concerns if RDP provides access to such systems.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Recommendation (Easy Fix):</strong> Implement strict
firewall rules to limit RDP access to trusted source IPs only. If remote
access is required, place RDP behind a VPN (Virtual Private
Network).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Recommendation (Long-term Fix):</strong> Implement a more
secure remote access solution like a Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA)
solution or a VPN with strong MFA, ensuring RDP is never directly
exposed to the internet.</p></li>
