<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This document details the current cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, as assessed through an analysis of
provided network scan data, a self-reported organizational security
questionnaire, and a list of pre-existing risks. The objective is to
identify critical security deficiencies, evaluate existing threats, and
formulate concrete recommendations to strengthen the organization’s
defensive capabilities.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-control-gaps">Analysis of Control Gaps</h2>
<p>The questionnaire responses highlight significant deficiencies in
fundamental cybersecurity hygiene:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> The lack of
Multi-Factor Authentication for sensitive data systems is a critical
vulnerability. This significantly increases the risk of unauthorized
access should user credentials be compromised through phishing or other
attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> The absence of a
formal AUP means employees may not be aware of expected conduct
regarding IT resource usage, potentially leading to unintentional policy
violations, data leakage, or introduction of malware.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Security Awareness Training:</strong> No security
awareness training for new employees or annual training for all
employees is a severe weakness. The human element is often the weakest
link in cybersecurity, and without regular training, employees are
highly susceptible to social engineering attacks, phishing, and other
common threats.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed on the target IP address . The
scan results revealed the following open ports and identified
services:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 3389 (TCP)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Service Name:</strong> <code>ms-wbt-server</code>
(Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol - RDP)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>State:</strong> Open</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Risk Profile:</strong> The exposure of RDP directly to
the internet is a common and critical security risk. RDP is frequently
targeted by threat actors for brute-force attacks, credential stuffing,
and exploitation of known vulnerabilities to gain initial access to
networks. Without stringent controls such as VPN access, strong
authentication, and network-level filtering, this open port represents a
significant attack surface.</p></li>
</ul></li>

<p>This section synthesizes the findings from the security control
review, technical scan, and pre-existing vulnerability data to present a

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the comprehensive assessment, the following actionable
recommendations are provided to mitigate identified risks and enhance
the organization’s cybersecurity posture.</p>
<h2 id="immediate-actions-high-priority">Immediate Actions (High
Priority)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Secure RDP Exposure:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Short-Term (Emergency):</strong> Implement strict
firewall rules to restrict access to port 3389 (RDP) to only specific,
trusted source IP addresses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Long-Term (Best Practice):</strong> Place all RDP
services behind a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or a secure gateway.
Users must connect to the VPN first before RDP access is granted.
Completely disable direct RDP exposure to the internet.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong>
Mandate and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication for all systems that
process, store, or provide access to sensitive organizational data. This
should be a top priority to protect against credential theft.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Initiate Comprehensive Security Awareness
Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and deliver mandatory security awareness training for all
new employees as part of their onboarding process.</p></li>
<li><p>Schedule and enforce annual, recurring security awareness
training for all existing employees. Training should cover current
threat landscapes, including phishing, social engineering, ransomware,
and safe browsing practices.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="medium-term-actions">Medium-Term Actions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a clear, comprehensive Acceptable Use Policy
outlining the proper and prohibited use of organizational IT resources,
data, and systems. Ensure all employees read, understand, and formally
acknowledge this policy. Integrate AUP review into onboarding and annual
employee performance cycles.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Vulnerability Scanning and Penetration
Testing:</strong> Implement a routine schedule for both internal and
external vulnerability scans to proactively identify and address new
security weaknesses as the environment evolves. Consider periodic
penetration testing to simulate real-world attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Test an Incident Response Plan
(IRP):</strong> Create a formal Incident Response Plan that outlines
procedures for detecting, analyzing, containing, eradicating, recovering
from, and post-incident reviewing security incidents. Conduct tabletop
exercises and drills to ensure the plan is effective and personnel are
trained.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The cybersecurity posture of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>
currently faces significant challenges, notably the direct exposure of
RDP services, the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for sensitive
data systems, and critical gaps in employee security training and policy
enforcement. These identified vulnerabilities and control gaps
collectively present a high risk to the organization’s information
assets and operational continuity. By systematically implementing the
recommendations outlined in this report, <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong> can substantially reduce its attack surface, enhance its
resilience against cyber threats, and foster a more secure operational
environment. A proactive and continuous commitment to cybersecurity best
practices is paramount for long-term security.</p>
