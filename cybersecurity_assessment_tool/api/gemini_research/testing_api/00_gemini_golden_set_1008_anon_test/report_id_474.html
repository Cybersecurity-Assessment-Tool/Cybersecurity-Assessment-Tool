<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides an assessment of the current cybersecurity
posture for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on an
organizational security questionnaire review, a targeted network scan of
<code>[Target IP]</code>, and an analysis of pre-existing risk data.</p>
<p>The assessment identified a critical control gap related to the
absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins,
significantly increasing the risk of unauthorized access. The network
scan of <code>[Target IP]</code> revealed no open ports, specifically
indicating port 80 as closed. This finding directly contradicts an
existing risk entry describing an "Unencrypted Web Server" with port 80
open. Recommendations have been provided to address identified
weaknesses and enhance overall security.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-questionnaire-findings">Analysis of Questionnaire
Findings</h2>
<p>The organization demonstrates good practice in several areas,
including the implementation of MFA for email and sensitive data
systems, the presence of an acceptable use policy, and regular security
awareness training. However, the lack of mandatory Multi-Factor
Authentication for logging into computers represents a critical security
vulnerability. This significantly increases the risk of successful
brute-force attacks or credential stuffing leading to unauthorized
access to internal systems, as a single compromised password could grant
full access.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed using Nmap against the target
<code>[Target IP]</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not available in provided
data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Target:</strong> <code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Used:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> Up</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="open-ports-and-services">Open Ports and Services</h2>
<p>The Nmap scan indicated that no ports were found to be open on the
target <code>[Target IP]</code>. Specifically, port 80 was reported as
<code>closed</code>. No services, products, or versions were identified
on any open ports, as none were found.</p>
<h2 id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of Technical
Findings</h2>
<p>The network scan identified no immediately exploitable open ports or
services on the designated target. The finding that port 80 is
<code>closed</code> is notable, as it directly contradicts one of the
pre-existing risks identified in Input 3 (an "Unencrypted Web Server"
with port 80 open). This suggests that the "Unencrypted Web Server" risk
may either be outdated, remediated, or pertain to a different asset not
covered by this specific scan.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis, the following actionable recommendations are
provided to enhance the cybersecurity posture of <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer
Logins (High Priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Mandate and enforce MFA for all user
logins to organizational computers, workstations, and servers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Significantly reduces the risk of
unauthorized access due to stolen or compromised credentials, even if
passwords are breached.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Details:</strong> Evaluate and deploy a suitable MFA
solution compatible with existing operating systems and infrastructure
(e.g., Azure AD MFA, Duo Security, YubiKeys). Provide user training and
support during rollout.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Verify and Update Existing Risk Register (Medium
Priority):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Thoroughly review the "Unencrypted Web
Server" risk (and other pre-existing risks) against current operational
status and asset inventory.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Ensures the risk register accurately
reflects the current threat landscape and asset posture, preventing
unnecessary resource allocation for already mitigated issues and
identifying true outstanding risks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Details:</strong> If Port 80 is indeed closed on the
relevant assets, mark the risk as remediated or re-evaluate its
applicability to other potential web servers or services.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Continuous Security Monitoring and Asset Discovery
(Ongoing):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Implement or enhance continuous
monitoring solutions for network activity, host logs, and security
events. Regularly perform authenticated and unauthenticated
vulnerability scans on all internal and external assets.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Early detection of potential
intrusions, anomalous behavior, or newly exposed services, even if no
open ports were immediately present during this limited scope scan. This
helps maintain an up-to-date asset inventory and identifies
configuration drift.</p></li>
