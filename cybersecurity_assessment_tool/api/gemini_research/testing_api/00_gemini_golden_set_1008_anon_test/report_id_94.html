<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">1. Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides an assessment of the current cybersecurity
posture for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The review is based on
an organizational security questionnaire, technical network scan data,
and an existing risk register.</p>
<p>While the organization demonstrates good practices in implementing
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for critical access points and
maintaining an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), significant gaps were
identified in security awareness training. Specifically, there is no
formal security awareness training for new employees or annual refresher
training for all employees. The provided network scan data was empty,
indicating no active services were identified or the scan was
inconclusive/incomplete. No pre-existing vulnerabilities were provided
in the risk register. Addressing the identified training deficiencies is
crucial for enhancing the overall human firewall and mitigating social
engineering risks.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-questionnaire">3.1 Analysis of
Questionnaire</h2>
<p>The organization has robust MFA enforcement and an AUP, which are
foundational security practices. However, a significant critical gap
exists in security awareness training. The lack of training for new
employees means they are immediately vulnerable to social engineering
attacks upon joining. The absence of annual training for all employees
leaves the entire workforce susceptible to evolving threats like
phishing, malware, and social engineering over time. This represents a
substantial human factor risk.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">6. Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and enhance the overall cybersecurity
posture, the following recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Mandatory New Employee Security Awareness
Training:</strong> Develop and implement a comprehensive security
awareness training program for all new hires. This training should be a
mandatory component of the onboarding process, covering topics such as
phishing, malware, password hygiene, social engineering, and acceptable
use policies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Annual Security Awareness Training for All
Employees:</strong> Conduct mandatory, annual security awareness
training for all employees. This training should be engaging, up-to-date
with current threat landscapes, and include simulated phishing exercises
to reinforce learning.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regularly Review and Update Training Content:</strong>
Ensure that security awareness training materials are regularly reviewed
and updated to reflect new threats, organizational policy changes, and
best practices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Monitor and Evaluate Training Effectiveness:</strong>
Implement metrics to track participation and effectiveness of security
awareness training (e.g., click rates on simulated phishing emails
before and after training).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Regular External Network Scans:</strong> If not
already performing, schedule and conduct regular external vulnerability
scans (e.g., quarterly) against public-facing IP addresses to identify
any inadvertently exposed services or misconfigurations. Ensure
comprehensive scan data is collected and analyzed for proactive risk
management.</p></li>
