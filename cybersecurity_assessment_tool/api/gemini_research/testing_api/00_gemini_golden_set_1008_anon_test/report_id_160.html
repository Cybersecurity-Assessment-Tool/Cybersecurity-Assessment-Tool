<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings from a cybersecurity posture
assessment for . The assessment involved a review of organizational
security controls via a questionnaire, an external network scan, and an
analysis of pre-existing known risks.</p>
<p>The overall security posture is assessed as
<strong>Moderate</strong>. While external scanning identified no
immediately exploitable open ports, suggesting a relatively hardened
perimeter, a critical gap was identified in the organization’s
multi-factor authentication (MFA) strategy. Specifically, MFA is not
required for computer logins, which presents a significant risk of
unauthorized access should credentials be compromised. There were no
pre-existing vulnerabilities reported at the time of this
assessment.</p>
<p>Key findings include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Critical Gap:</strong> Lack of Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for computer logins.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Positive Finding:</strong> No open ports were identified
during the external network scan of <code>[Target IP]</code>, indicating
a minimal external attack surface for common network services.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Good practices are in place for MFA
on email and sensitive data systems, employee acceptable use policy, and
security awareness training.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Immediate recommendations focus on implementing MFA for computer
logins and regular external vulnerability assessments to maintain a
robust security posture.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-questionnaire-results">Analysis
of Questionnaire Results</h2>
<p>The questionnaire highlights a strong commitment to several key
security practices, including MFA for high-value targets (email,
sensitive data) and comprehensive security awareness training. However,
a significant area of concern is the lack of MFA for computer logins
(Q2). This gap allows for a single point of failure (compromised
credentials) to grant access to internal systems, making it a
high-priority risk.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed using Nmap. The scan targeted
<code>[Target IP]</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Used:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Target IP/Hostname:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not provided in input data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Status:</strong> Up</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="detailed-findings">Detailed Findings</h2>
<p>The Nmap scan results indicated that no open ports were identified on
the target host <code>[Target IP]</code>. All scanned extraports were
reported as "closed".</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports Found:</strong> None</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Services Identified:</strong> None</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Products/Versions Identified:</strong> None</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This finding suggests a minimal external attack surface for commonly
exploited network services. While a positive indicator, it’s important
to note that this assessment is limited to the scope of the external
scan and does not cover internal vulnerabilities or application-layer
weaknesses.</p>

of Multi-Factor Authentication for Computer Logins (High Severity)</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Description:</strong> The organization does not enforce
MFA for user logins to computers, as indicated by the "No" response to
Q2.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact:</strong> High. Without MFA, a single factor
(username/password) is sufficient for authentication. If an attacker
gains access to valid credentials (e.g., through phishing, keylogging,
or brute-force attacks), they can gain unauthorized access to internal
systems, potentially escalating privileges, accessing sensitive data,
deploying malware, or disrupting operations.</p></li>

</ul>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are provided to
enhance the cybersecurity posture of . Recommendations are prioritized
based on the severity of the associated risks.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication for Computer Logins
(R1 - High Priority)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Description:</strong> Deploy and enforce multi-factor
authentication for all computer login processes across the organization.
This should apply to both domain-joined and standalone systems, for both
local and remote access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Significantly enhances account security
by requiring an additional verification factor beyond just a password,
making it much harder for attackers to gain unauthorized access even if
they obtain user credentials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action Steps:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Research and select an MFA solution compatible with existing
infrastructure (e.g., Active Directory, cloud identity
providers).</p></li>
<li><p>Develop a phased deployment plan, starting with administrative
accounts and high-privilege users.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide comprehensive user training and support for the new MFA
system.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement strict policies to ensure MFA cannot be
bypassed.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Regular External Vulnerability Scans (R2 - Medium
Priority)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Description:</strong> While the current scan showed no
open ports, security postures can change rapidly. Regular, scheduled
external vulnerability scans are crucial to identify any newly exposed
services, misconfigurations, or known vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Proactively identifies potential
weaknesses in the external perimeter before they can be exploited by
malicious actors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action Steps:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Schedule quarterly or bi-annual external vulnerability scans
using a reputable scanning tool or service.</p></li>
<li><p>Review scan results promptly and remediate any identified
vulnerabilities within defined service level agreements (SLAs).</p></li>
<li><p>Consider engaging third-party penetration testers for annual
comprehensive external assessments.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Consider an Internal Security Audit (R3 - Medium
Priority)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Description:</strong> The current assessment focused on
external exposure. An internal security audit, including an internal
vulnerability scan and configuration review, would provide a more
complete picture of the organization’s security posture from within the
network.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Identifies vulnerabilities that are not
externally visible but could be exploited by an attacker who has already
gained initial access or by malicious insiders.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action Steps:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Plan an internal vulnerability scan across all network segments
and device types.</p></li>
<li><p>Review server and workstation configurations against security
benchmarks (e.g., CIS Benchmarks).</p></li>
<li><p>Assess internal network segmentation and access
controls.</p></li>
