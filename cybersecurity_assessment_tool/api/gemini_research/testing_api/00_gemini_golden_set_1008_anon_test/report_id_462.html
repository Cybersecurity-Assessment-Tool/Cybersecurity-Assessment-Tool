<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">1. Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings from a cybersecurity posture
assessment conducted for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The
assessment involved reviewing organizational security policies and
practices through a questionnaire, analyzing current network scan data
for the target <code>[Target IP]</code>, and correlating with
pre-existing risk information.</p>
<p>Key findings indicate significant gaps in foundational security
controls, particularly concerning multi-factor authentication (MFA) for
computer logins, the absence of an acceptable use policy (AUP), and a
lack of consistent annual security awareness training for employees.
While the network scan revealed no immediate critical open ports or
services on the scanned target, the limited information obtained due to
closed ports indicates a secure initial posture in that specific area. A
previously identified risk regarding an unencrypted web server (Port 80)
appears to be mitigated based on current scan data.</p>
<p>Overall, the organization faces a moderate to high risk posture
primarily due to policy and human factor vulnerabilities that could be
exploited through social engineering or internal negligence. Addressing
these foundational issues is paramount to improving the overall security
stance.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">4. Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed using Nmap against the specified
target.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Target:</strong> <code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> Not provided in input data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Used:</strong> nmap</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="host-status-and-open-ports">4.1. Host Status
and Open Ports</h2>
<p>The scanned host <code>[Target IP]</code> was identified as
<strong>up</strong>. A detailed port scan yielded the following
results:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 80 (HTTP):</strong> State <strong>closed</strong>.
No service or version information was obtained for this port, consistent
with its closed state.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note:</em> No other open ports, services, products, or versions
were identified during this scan. The closed state of Port 80 indicates
that the immediate risk of an unencrypted web server, as mentioned in
pre-existing risks, is currently mitigated or not present on this
specific target.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment">5. Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes findings from the security control review,
technical scans, and pre-existing risk data. Risks are categorized by
severity.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="high-severity-risks">5.1. High Severity
Risks</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer
Login</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Overview:</em> The organization does not require MFA for
users logging into computers. This significantly increases the risk of
unauthorized access if credentials are stolen or compromised through
phishing or other means.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Severity:</em> High</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Annual Security Awareness Training</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Overview:</em> While new employees receive security awareness
training, existing employees do not receive annual refresher training.
This leads to a degradation of security knowledge over time, making
employees more susceptible to evolving social engineering tactics and
phishing campaigns.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Severity:</em> High</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="medium-severity-risks">5.2. Medium Severity
Risks</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Overview:</em> The lack of an AUP leaves employees without
clear guidelines regarding appropriate use of company IT resources, data
handling, and internet browsing. This can lead to increased risks from
malware, data leakage, and compliance issues.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Severity:</em> Medium</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Unencrypted Web Server (Historical Risk / Potentially
Mitigated)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Overview:</em> A pre-existing vulnerability noted an
unencrypted web server on Port 80. However, the current network scan
shows Port 80 as <strong>closed</strong>. This suggests the
vulnerability is either remediated, or the asset is no longer active, or
the risk refers to a different system not scanned. While the immediate
technical risk on the scanned target appears mitigated, it’s crucial to
confirm if this risk applies to other assets or if the remediation is
complete and verified.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Severity (Historical):</em> Medium (CVSS 5.0)</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">6. Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and enhance the organization’s
cybersecurity posture, the following recommendations are provided:</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="immediate-actions-high-priority">6.1.
Immediate Actions (High Priority)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Logins:</strong> Immediately
deploy and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication for all user accounts
accessing company computers and systems. This is a critical control
against credential theft.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish and Enforce Annual Security Awareness
Training:</strong> Develop and implement a mandatory annual security
awareness training program for all employees. This training should cover
current threats, phishing detection, data handling best practices, and
organizational policies.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="short-term-actions-medium-priority">6.2.
Short-Term Actions (Medium Priority)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a comprehensive AUP that outlines employee
responsibilities, acceptable use of company IT resources, data handling
guidelines, and consequences for non-compliance. Ensure all employees
acknowledge and understand the policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Verify Remediation of Historical Risks:</strong> Confirm
the status of the "Unencrypted Web Server" risk. If Port 80 was indeed
previously open, ensure a secure alternative (e.g., HTTPS with valid
SSL/TLS certificates) is used for any web services, and verify that all
affected systems are properly secured or decommissioned.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="long-term-strategy-continuous-improvement">6.3. Long-Term Strategy
(Continuous Improvement)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Regular Policy Review:</strong> Periodically review and
update all security policies (including AUP, MFA policies, training
policies) to ensure they remain current with evolving threats and
organizational needs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Proactive Threat Hunting and Monitoring:</strong>
Implement advanced threat detection and monitoring solutions to identify
and respond to suspicious activities promptly.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Vulnerability Assessments and Penetration
Testing:</strong> Conduct periodic vulnerability scans and penetration
tests against all organizational assets to identify and remediate new
security weaknesses before they can be exploited.</p></li>
