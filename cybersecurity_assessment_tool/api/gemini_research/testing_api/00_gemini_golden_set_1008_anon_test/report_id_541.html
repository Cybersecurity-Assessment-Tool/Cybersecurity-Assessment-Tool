<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment conducted for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The
assessment was performed using three primary data sources: a network
scan (Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON), organizational security questionnaire
responses (Input_2_Org_Data_JSON), and a review of existing known risks
(Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON). The objective is to provide a clear,
concise overview of the organization’s current security stance, identify
key vulnerabilities and risks, and propose practical recommendations for
improvement.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following information was gathered from the provided data. Where
specific details were not provided (e.g., Organization Name, Email
Domain, External IP), placeholders have been used to maintain the report
structure.</p>

<h1 id="security-control-review-questionnaire-analysis">Security Control
Review (Questionnaire Analysis)</h1>
<p>A review of the organizational security questionnaire responses
reveals several key areas of strength and notable weaknesses regarding
fundamental security controls. Each question and its corresponding
answer are presented below, with a visual indicator for "Yes" () and
"No" () answers.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-questionnaire-findings">Analysis
of Questionnaire Findings</h2>
<p>The questionnaire highlights significant vulnerabilities in identity
and access management, specifically the lack of Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for email and computer logins. This omission
dramatically increases the risk of credential-based attacks leading to
unauthorized access. Furthermore, the absence of security awareness
training for new employees is a critical gap, making the organization
susceptible to social engineering attacks targeting its newest members.
Positively, MFA is used for sensitive data systems, an acceptable use
policy is in place, and annual security awareness training is conducted
for all employees.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed, providing insights into publicly
exposed services. The target IP was not specified in the input; thus, a
placeholder is used.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> November 22, 2025, 10:00 UTC</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="detailed-findings">Detailed Findings</h2>
<p>The scan revealed one open port and service:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port:</strong> 443 (TCP)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Service:</strong> HTTPS</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Product:</strong> Nginx</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.18.0</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of
Technical Findings</h2>
<p>The identification of Nginx version 1.18.0 is a significant concern.
Nginx 1.18.0 was released in April 2020 and is no longer actively
supported or receiving security updates. Current stable versions are
1.24.x (released September 2022) or the mainline 1.26.x (released April
2024) at the time of this assessment. Running outdated web server
software leaves the organization vulnerable to known exploits and
security vulnerabilities that have been patched in newer versions. This
exposes the service, and potentially the underlying infrastructure, to
compromise.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section consolidates the findings from the questionnaire
analysis and technical scans, presenting a comprehensive view of the
identified risks. No pre-existing vulnerabilities were provided in
Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON, indicating that either no such
vulnerabilities are known or recorded, or the data was not available for
inclusion.</p>

</div>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the assessment, the following recommendations are provided
to mitigate the identified risks and enhance the overall cybersecurity
posture of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for All Email
Accounts:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Mandate and enforce MFA for all organizational
email accounts.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Significantly reduces the risk of email account
compromise, even if passwords are stolen, by requiring a second
verification factor. This is a critical control against common attacks
like phishing and credential stuffing.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for All
Computer Logins:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Deploy and require MFA for logging into all
organizational computers and workstations (e.g., via operating system
integration or third-party solutions).</p></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Enhances endpoint security by adding an extra
layer of protection against unauthorized access to corporate devices and
resources, preventing lateral movement in case of credential
theft.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Note:</em> Consider implementing Conditional Access Policies
to adapt MFA requirements based on context (e.g., location, device
health).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Update Nginx Web Server to a Supported
Version:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Plan and execute an upgrade of the Nginx web
server from version 1.18.0 to the latest stable and supported version
(e.g., Nginx 1.24.x or 1.26.x mainline).</p></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Ensures that the web server benefits from the
latest security patches, bug fixes, and performance improvements,
significantly reducing the attack surface from known
vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Note:</em> Prioritize thorough testing in a non-production
environment before deploying to production to ensure compatibility and
stability.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Mandatory Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Develop and implement a mandatory, comprehensive
security awareness training program for all new hires, to be completed
as part of their onboarding process.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Equips new employees with essential
cybersecurity knowledge and best practices from day one, making them
less susceptible to social engineering attacks (phishing, pretexting)
and improving overall organizational security culture.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Note:</em> Regularly update training content to reflect
current threat landscapes and conduct follow-up refreshers.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The cybersecurity posture assessment for <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong> reveals several critical areas requiring immediate
attention, particularly regarding foundational security controls such as
Multi-Factor Authentication and maintaining up-to-date software.
Addressing the high-severity risks related to MFA for email and computer
access, alongside implementing crucial training for new employees, will
significantly enhance the organization’s defense against prevalent cyber
threats. Proactive remediation of these issues, coupled with regular
security reviews, is essential for building a resilient and secure
operational environment.</p>
