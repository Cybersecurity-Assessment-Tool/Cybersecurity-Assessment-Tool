<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on an analysis of provided
organizational data, network scan results, and existing vulnerability
records. The assessment reveals a generally positive stance regarding
multi-factor authentication and security awareness training. However, a
critical gap was identified concerning the absence of an Employee
Acceptable Use Policy, which is fundamental for defining expected
employee conduct and reducing insider risk. Furthermore, while the
network scan did not identify any open ports, an existing record noted a
potential "Unencrypted Web Server" vulnerability. The lack of an open
port 80 during the scan suggests a potential mitigation or that the
original finding might be outdated or refer to an internal service not
externally exposed. Overall, the organization demonstrates foundational
security practices but requires immediate attention to policy
development to strengthen its human element defenses.</p>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This document serves as a comprehensive cybersecurity posture
assessment report, synthesizing data from a security questionnaire, a
targeted network scan, and an inventory of known vulnerabilities. The
objective is to provide an objective overview of the current security
landscape, identify critical gaps and risks, and offer actionable
recommendations to enhance the overall security posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-questionnaire-findings">Analysis
of Questionnaire Findings</h2>
<p>The organization demonstrates a strong commitment to multi-factor
authentication (MFA) across critical access points and maintains a
regular schedule for security awareness training. This is highly
commendable and forms a robust foundation for identity and access
management and human firewall aspects.</p>
<p>However, a significant finding is the <strong>absence of an Employee
Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)</strong>. An AUP is crucial for setting
clear expectations for employee conduct regarding organizational IT
resources, data handling, and internet usage. Without one, employees may
unknowingly engage in practices that pose security risks, and the
organization lacks a formal basis for disciplinary action in case of
misuse. This represents a critical policy gap.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed to identify exposed services and
potential vulnerabilities. The scan was conducted by Nmap.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> [Scan Date] <em>(Date not provided in
input data)</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Used:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="detailed-scan-findings">Detailed Scan
Findings</h2>
<p>The network scan identified one host as ‘up‘ but did not reveal any
open ports for the target . Specifically, port 80 was found to be
‘closed‘. This indicates that, at the time of the scan, no external web
service was running or accessible on this particular port. No services,
products, or versions were identified on open ports.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>

</div>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="risk-correlation-and-analysis">Risk
Correlation and Analysis</h2>
<p>The primary risk identified from the organizational data is the lack
of an Employee Acceptable Use Policy. This is a foundational policy
document that, if missing, can lead to a cascade of other risks related
to data handling, intellectual property, and system misuse.</p>
<p>Regarding the technical scan, no open ports were found, which is a
positive security posture from an external attack surface perspective.
However, the existing records mention an "Unencrypted Web Server" with
Port 80 being open. Given the recent scan found Port 80 to be closed,
this suggests either:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The risk has been mitigated or is no longer present on the
targeted external interface.</p></li>
<li><p>The existing record refers to an internal server or a different
external IP address not covered by this specific scan.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Despite the current scan results, it is prudent to review the basis
of this existing vulnerability record to ensure no unencrypted web
services are exposed, either internally or externally, on any part of
the organization’s network.</p>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are provided to
enhance the cybersecurity posture of <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Immediately draft, approve, and implement a comprehensive
AUP.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure the AUP clearly outlines expectations for system usage,
data handling, internet browsing, email etiquette, and consequences for
non-compliance.</p></li>
<li><p>Distribute the AUP to all employees and require acknowledgment of
receipt and understanding.</p></li>
<li><p>Integrate AUP review into annual security awareness
training.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Review Existing Vulnerability Records and Validate
Mitigations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Investigate the "Unencrypted Web Server" vulnerability
record.</p></li>
<li><p>Confirm whether the associated service has been adequately
secured (e.g., migrated to HTTPS, shut down, or is indeed not externally
accessible).</p></li>
<li><p>If the service still exists internally, ensure it is properly
segmented and only accessible to authorized personnel. Prioritize
encryption (HTTPS) for all web services, internal or external, where
sensitive data is handled.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Network Scanning and Vulnerability
Management:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement a schedule for regular internal and external network
vulnerability scans.</p></li>
<li><p>Establish a formal vulnerability management program to identify,
assess, prioritize, and remediate security vulnerabilities
promptly.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Continuous Improvement:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Continuously monitor the security landscape for new threats and
adjust security controls accordingly.</p></li>
<li><p>Periodically review and update security policies and procedures
to reflect changes in technology, business operations, and threat
intelligence.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p><strong>[Organization Name]</strong> exhibits a commendable baseline
with strong MFA implementation and security awareness training.
Addressing the identified policy gap (AUP) and thoroughly validating
existing vulnerability records, such as the "Unencrypted Web Server,"
will significantly bolster the organization’s defenses and mature its
overall cybersecurity posture. Proactive policy development combined
with vigilant technical oversight is key to maintaining a resilient
security environment.</p>
