<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report summarizes the findings of a cybersecurity assessment
conducted for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The assessment,
performed on (representing the client’s external presence), combined a
review of organizational security controls, an external network scan,
and an evaluation of current risks. Key findings indicate generally good
adherence to Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) practices and annual
security training, but significant gaps were identified concerning
security awareness training for new employees and the use of outdated
web server software. These areas present immediate risks that require
attention to bolster the organization’s overall security posture.</p>

<h2 id="key-observations-from-questionnaire">Key Observations from
Questionnaire</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>The organization demonstrates strong adherence to Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) across critical systems, which is a significant
security strength.</p></li>
<li><p>An Acceptable Use Policy is in place, indicating foundational
governance around employee conduct.</p></li>
<li><p>A critical gap exists in the provision of security awareness
training for <strong>new employees</strong>. While annual training for
all employees is conducted, the absence of initial training leaves new
hires vulnerable to social engineering and other threats during their
crucial onboarding period.</p></li>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An Nmap scan was conducted on the target system on . The following
open ports and services were identified:</p>

<li><p><strong>Port 443 (TCP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>State:</strong> Open</p></li>

Technical Scan</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>The Nginx web server running on port 443 is identified as version
1.18.0. This is an older stable release (released in April 2020), which
may contain known vulnerabilities that have been addressed in more
recent versions. Maintaining outdated software increases the attack
surface and exposes the system to potential exploitation.</p></li>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following recommendations are provided to mitigate the identified
risks and enhance the overall security posture of <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="immediate-actions">Immediate Actions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement New Employee Security Awareness
Training:</strong> Develop and implement a mandatory security awareness
training program for all new hires, to be completed as part of their
onboarding process. This training should cover essential topics such as
phishing, social engineering, password hygiene, acceptable use policies,
and incident reporting procedures.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Update Nginx Web Server:</strong> Plan and execute an
upgrade of the Nginx web server on to the latest stable version.
Prioritize this upgrade to benefit from critical security patches and
performance improvements. Ensure proper testing is conducted in a
staging environment before deploying to production.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="long-term-strategic-recommendations">Long-Term Strategic
Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Regular Software Patching and Updates:</strong> Establish
a robust patch management program for all software, operating systems,
and network devices. This includes regular scanning for vulnerabilities
and promptly applying security updates as they become
available.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Periodic Security Assessments:</strong> Conduct regular
(e.g., annual) cybersecurity assessments, including penetration testing
and vulnerability scanning, to proactively identify and address emerging
risks and vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enhance Incident Response Plan:</strong> Ensure the
organization’s incident response plan is up-to-date and includes
specific procedures for handling social engineering incidents and
compromises stemming from outdated software vulnerabilities. Regularly
test the plan through tabletop exercises and simulations.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>While <strong>[Organization Name]</strong> exhibits strong controls
in several critical areas, the identified gaps in new employee security
awareness training and the use of outdated web server software represent
tangible risks that could lead to security incidents. Addressing these
issues through the recommended actions will significantly strengthen the
organization’s defenses against common attack vectors and contribute to
a more resilient and secure operational environment.</p>
