<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on an analysis of network
scan data, organizational security questionnaire responses, and a review
of existing risk data. While the organization demonstrates a
foundational commitment to security through acceptable use policies and
regular security awareness training, critical gaps have been identified.
Specifically, a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) service is openly exposed,
correlating with a known critical vulnerability. Furthermore, the
absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins
presents a high-risk security control deficiency. These findings
collectively indicate a need for immediate remediation efforts focused
on network perimeter hardening and robust identity and access management
controls to significantly enhance the overall security posture.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> While the organization has implemented
several important security controls, a significant gap exists regarding
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins. The lack of MFA
for local or domain computer access substantially increases the risk of
unauthorized access through credential theft or brute-force attacks,
especially when combined with exposed services. This deficiency is a
high-priority risk.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed to identify open ports and services on
the target system.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>
<code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Used:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="open-ports-and-services">Open Ports and
Services</h2>
<p>The following open ports and services were identified during the
scan:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 3389/TCP (Service:
<code>ms-wbt-server</code>):</strong> This port is commonly associated
with the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), which allows graphical remote
access to a server. Its open status indicates that the target system is
accepting RDP connections. No specific product or version information
was identified by the scanner for this service.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The exposure of RDP (port 3389) directly
to the internet is a critical finding. RDP is a frequent target for
attackers attempting to gain initial access, often via brute-force
attacks, credential stuffing, or exploitation of known vulnerabilities
in the RDP service. Without robust compensating controls, such as MFA,
strong, complex passwords, and strict IP-based access restrictions, this
exposure represents a significant entry point for adversaries. This
technical finding directly confirms a pre-existing high-severity
risk.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section correlates findings from the security control review,
technical scans, and existing vulnerability data into a consolidated
risk assessment, prioritizing the identified issues based on their

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are provided to
enhance the cybersecurity posture of <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong>. Addressing these findings will significantly reduce the
attack surface and improve the organization’s resilience against cyber
threats.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="immediate-action-items">Immediate Action
Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Address RDP Exposure (Port 3389):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Short-Term Fix:</strong> Immediately restrict direct
external access to RDP (Port 3389) from the internet. This could involve
configuring firewall rules to block inbound connections to this
port.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Long-Term Fix:</strong> If external RDP access is
required, implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution. Users
should be required to establish a VPN connection before being able to
access RDP services internally.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all RDP accounts utilize strong, unique passwords and are
regularly audited.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider implementing Network Level Authentication (NLA) for RDP
if not already in place, which requires authentication before a full RDP
session is established.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Logins:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Deploy and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication for all user
logins to internal computers and systems (e.g., domain-joined machines,
critical servers). This is a critical control to prevent unauthorized
access even if primary credentials are compromised.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="long-term-strategic-recommendations">Long-Term Strategic
Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Regular Vulnerability Scanning and Penetration
Testing:</strong> Conduct periodic vulnerability scans and penetration
tests against both internal and external assets to proactively identify
and remediate weaknesses in the network, applications, and
configurations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Security Awareness Training Reinforcement:</strong>
Continue and expand comprehensive security awareness training for all
employees. Emphasize the importance of strong passwords, the risks
associated with RDP exposure, credential theft, and the benefits of
MFA.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Incident Response Planning and Testing:</strong> Ensure a
robust and well-documented incident response plan is in place and
regularly tested through tabletop exercises to ensure the organization
can effectively detect, respond to, and recover from security
breaches.</p></li>
