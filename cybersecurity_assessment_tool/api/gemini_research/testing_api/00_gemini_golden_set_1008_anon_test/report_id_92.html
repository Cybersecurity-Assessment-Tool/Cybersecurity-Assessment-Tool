<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive assessment of the cybersecurity
posture for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on an analysis
of network scan data, responses to a security control questionnaire, and
an existing risk register.</p>
<p>The assessment reveals several critical gaps, particularly concerning
security policies and employee training. Key findings include the
absence of an Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and a complete lack
of security awareness training for both new and existing employees. From
a technical perspective, an open port 80 was identified on the target
system, warranting further investigation to identify the service and
ensure its secure configuration. An unusual entry in the existing risk
register was also noted, highlighting the need for rigorous risk
validation.</p>
<p>While the organization demonstrates strength in enforcing
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across key access points, the
identified policy, training, and technical vulnerabilities collectively
present a significant attack surface and elevate the overall risk
profile. Immediate action on the provided recommendations is advised to
mitigate these risks and enhance the organization’s defensive
capabilities.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following organizational details were used for this assessment.

<h1 id="security-control-review-questionnaire">Security Control Review
(Questionnaire)</h1>
<p>A security control questionnaire was administered to gauge the
organization’s adherence to foundational cybersecurity practices. The
responses highlight strengths in MFA implementation but reveal critical
deficiencies in policy and training.</p>
<p>The following table summarizes the responses:</p>

<h2 id="identified-critical-gaps-from-questionnaire">Identified Critical
Gaps from Questionnaire</h2>
<p>The "No" responses from the security control questionnaire indicate
critical gaps that significantly increase the organization’s risk
exposure.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong>
Without a formal AUP, employees may be unaware of the expected behavior
and responsible use of company IT assets. This lack of clear guidance
can lead to unintentional misuse, data breaches, or compliance
violations, posing a <strong>High Risk</strong> to data integrity and
organizational security.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong> New hires are frequently targeted by social
engineering attacks due to their unfamiliarity with organizational
security protocols. The lack of initial security awareness training
leaves new employees highly susceptible to phishing, malware, and other
attacks, representing a <strong>Critical Gap</strong> that increases the
likelihood of a successful breach.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Infrequent Annual Security Awareness Training:</strong>
Security threats are constantly evolving. Without regular, at least
annual, security awareness training for all employees, the workforce’s
knowledge of current threats, best practices, and organizational
policies will degrade over time. This significantly elevates the
human-factor risk, making the organization more vulnerable to emerging
threats and insider risks, posing a <strong>Critical Gap</strong> and a
<strong>High Risk</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="technical-vulnerabilities">Technical Vulnerabilities</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Open Port 80:</strong> The discovery of an open port 80
indicates an active service, typically a web server, is accessible from
the network. While the scan data did not provide details on the specific
service or its version, any internet-facing service is a potential
attack vector. If this service is unpatched, misconfigured, or running
outdated software, it could be exploited to gain unauthorized access,
deploy malware, or deface websites. This represents a <strong>Medium
Risk</strong> due to the potential for exploitation, which is elevated
to <strong>High Risk</strong> without further information on the
service’s security posture.</p></li>

<h2 id="existing-vulnerabilities-input_3">Existing Vulnerabilities

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the findings, the following recommendations are provided to
enhance the cybersecurity posture of <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Policy &amp; Governance Enhancements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Immediately draft and implement a clear, comprehensive
Acceptable Use Policy for all employees. This policy should outline
responsibilities, permissible uses of IT resources, and consequences for
non-compliance. Ensure all employees formally acknowledge and understand
the AUP.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Security Awareness Training Program:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Mandatory Onboarding Security Training:</strong>
Establish a mandatory security awareness training program for all new
employees, to be completed before they are granted full access to
company systems. This training should cover phishing, malware, password
best practices, and the new AUP.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Annual Refresher Training for All Employees:</strong>
Implement a program of mandatory annual security awareness training for
all employees. This training should be regularly updated to cover
emerging threats, current social engineering techniques, and changes in
organizational policies.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Technical Security Controls:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Identify and Secure Services on Port 80:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Immediately identify the exact service (e.g., Apache HTTP Server,
Nginx) running on port 80 and its version.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure the service is strictly necessary and, if so, that it is
fully patched to the latest stable version.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement secure configuration best practices, disabling all
non-essential features and modules.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider restricting access to port 80 to only necessary internal
or trusted external IP addresses, if feasible.</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluate the implementation of a Web Application Firewall (WAF)
to protect web services from common web-based attacks.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Risk Management Process Improvement:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Review and Validate Risk Register Entries:</strong>
Conduct a thorough audit of the organization’s existing risk register.
All entries should be reviewed for accuracy, relevance, and
actionability. Any anomalous or meta-instructional entries, like the one
identified, should be clarified, removed, or properly categorized within
a dedicated "testing" or "internal notes" section, distinct from active
security risks. Ensure the risk management process includes regular
review and validation cycles.</p></li>
