<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">1. Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings from a cybersecurity posture
assessment conducted for . The assessment involved a review of security
controls via a questionnaire, a technical network scan of , and an
analysis of existing identified risks.</p>
<p>Key findings indicate several critical vulnerabilities and
significant control gaps:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Critical Technical Vulnerability:</strong> An FTP service
(<code>vsftpd 2.3.4</code>) was found running on , which is notoriously
vulnerable to a backdoor (CVE-2011-2523). Furthermore, anonymous FTP
access is enabled, posing an immediate data breach risk.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Critical Policy Gaps:</strong> Lack of Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for email access significantly increases the risk
of account compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>High Control Gaps:</strong> Absence of regular security
awareness training for employees creates a high risk of successful
phishing attacks and other social engineering tactics.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Existing Medium Risk:</strong> The organization is
currently using outdated operating systems (Windows 7) on workstations,
which are no longer supported by vendors and are susceptible to known
exploits.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These findings collectively indicate a need for immediate
intervention to bolster the organization’s security defenses and reduce
its overall attack surface. Detailed recommendations are provided to
address each identified vulnerability and gap.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Analysis of Gaps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA for Email (Critical Gap):</strong> The lack of MFA
for email access is a severe vulnerability. Email is a primary vector
for phishing, business email compromise (BEC), and ransomware attacks.
Without MFA, compromised credentials can lead to widespread
organizational breaches.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Security Awareness Training (High Gap):</strong> The
absence of security awareness training for both new and existing
employees significantly increases the risk of human error-related
incidents. Employees are often the first line of defense, and without
proper training, they can inadvertently fall victim to social
engineering attacks, leading to malware infections, data loss, or
credential theft.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">4. Technical Scan
Results</h1>

port and running services.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> N/A (date not provided in input
data)</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Detailed Findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 21/tcp (FTP) - Open</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Service:</strong> FTP</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Product:</strong> <code>vsftpd</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Version:</strong> <code>2.3.4</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Vulnerability Details:</strong> <code>vsftpd</code>
version 2.3.4 is known to contain a backdoor (CVE-2011-2523). This
backdoor allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands as root by
sending a smiley face ‘:)‘ in the username field followed by an
arbitrary string as the password.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Configuration Issue:</strong> The Nmap scan also detected
that anonymous FTP login is allowed, indicating a serious
misconfiguration that could lead to unauthorized access to files or even
file uploads by external parties.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Technical Analysis:</strong> The presence of an outdated and
vulnerable FTP service (<code>vsftpd 2.3.4</code>) with an active
backdoor, coupled with anonymous access, represents an extremely
critical security risk. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to
gain root-level access to the system, compromise data, or use the system
as a pivot point for further attacks within the network. Anonymous
access further exacerbates the risk by allowing direct unauthorized file
access without requiring the exploit of the backdoor.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">6. Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following recommendations are provided to address the identified
risks and improve ’s cybersecurity posture.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="immediate-actions-critical-risks">6.1.
Immediate Actions (Critical Risks)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Mitigate vsftpd 2.3.4 Vulnerability:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Shut Down/Remove FTP Service Immediately:</strong> The
<code>vsftpd 2.3.4</code> service should be shut down or uninstalled as
a matter of urgency. Given the backdoor and anonymous access, it poses
an immediate and severe compromise risk.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Investigate Compromise:</strong> Assume the system
hosting the FTP service may have been compromised and conduct a thorough
forensic investigation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Replace/Upgrade FTP Securely:</strong> If FTP
functionality is required, replace it with a secure alternative (e.g.,
SFTP, FTPS) using an up-to-date and patched server version. Ensure
strong authentication and disable anonymous access.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Mandate MFA for All Email Accounts:</strong> Implement
and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication for all organizational email
accounts. This should be a top priority to protect against credential
theft and phishing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>User Education:</strong> Provide clear instructions and
support to employees during the MFA rollout.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="high-priority-actions">6.2. High Priority
Actions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Establish Comprehensive Security Awareness
Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>New Employee Onboarding:</strong> Develop and implement
mandatory security awareness training as part of the onboarding process
for all new employees.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Annual Training Program:</strong> Institute an annual or
bi-annual security awareness training program for all employees,
covering topics such as phishing, ransomware, social engineering,
password hygiene, and data handling.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Phishing Simulations:</strong> Conduct regular simulated
phishing campaigns to test employee vigilance and reinforce
training.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="medium-priority-actions">6.3. Medium Priority
Actions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Address Outdated Operating Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade Workstations:</strong> Develop and execute a plan
to upgrade all Windows 7 workstations to a currently supported operating
system (e.g., Windows 10 or 11).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Migration Strategy:</strong> Plan for data migration,
application compatibility testing, and user training during the upgrade
process.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Isolate Legacy Systems (if necessary):</strong> If
immediate upgrades are not feasible for some systems, isolate them from
the main network and implement compensating controls (e.g., strict
firewall rules, dedicated security solutions) to minimize risk.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="general-best-practices">6.4. General Best
Practices</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Regular Patch Management:</strong> Ensure all operating
systems, applications, and network devices are regularly patched and
updated to protect against known vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Network Segmentation:</strong> Implement network
segmentation to limit the lateral movement of attackers in case of a
breach.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Vulnerability Scanning &amp; Penetration
Testing:</strong> Conduct periodic vulnerability scans and penetration
tests to proactively identify and address security weaknesses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Incident Response Plan:</strong> Develop and regularly
test a comprehensive incident response plan to effectively manage and
recover from security incidents.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data Backup and Recovery:</strong> Implement a robust
data backup and recovery strategy, including offsite and immutable
backups, to ensure business continuity in the event of data loss or
ransomware attacks.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>By addressing these recommendations, can significantly enhance its
cybersecurity posture, reduce its attack surface, and better protect its
assets from evolving threats.</p>
