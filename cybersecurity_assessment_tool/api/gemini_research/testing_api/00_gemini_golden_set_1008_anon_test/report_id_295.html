<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on an analysis of network
scan data, organizational security questionnaire responses, and reported
pre-existing risks. The assessment identified several critical areas for
improvement. Key findings include a lack of Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) for sensitive data systems, the absence of an Employee Acceptable
Use Policy (AUP), and the presence of an open SSH service requiring
robust security configurations. While some controls are in place (e.g.,
MFA for email and computer login, regular security awareness training),
the identified gaps present notable risks to the organization’s
information security. Implementing the recommended actions will
significantly enhance overall resilience against common cyber
threats.</p>

<h2 id="key-gaps-from-questionnaire">Key Gaps from Questionnaire</h2>
<p>Based on the responses, the following critical gaps were
identified:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> The absence of
Multi-Factor Authentication for systems handling sensitive data
significantly elevates the risk of unauthorized access. Should primary
credentials (username/password) be compromised, attackers could gain
full access without an additional layer of verification.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):</strong> Without a
formal AUP, there is a lack of clear guidelines for employees regarding
the acceptable use of organizational IT resources, data handling, and
expected security behaviors. This can lead to increased risks from
unintentional misuse, insider threats, and potential legal
liabilities.</p></li>

<h2 id="technical-findings">Technical Findings</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Open SSH Port (22/tcp):</strong> An SSH (Secure Shell)
service was detected as open. SSH is a legitimate and widely used
protocol for secure remote administration. However, it is a frequent
target for automated brute-force attacks and exploits if not securely
configured. The scan did not provide specific product or version
information, which limits the ability to identify known vulnerabilities.
Nevertheless, general best practices for SSH security must be strictly
followed.</p></li>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and enhance the overall cybersecurity
posture, the following recommendations are provided. These are
actionable steps designed to mitigate vulnerabilities and strengthen
security controls.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Mandate and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication
for all access attempts to systems or applications that store, process,
or transmit sensitive organizational or client data. This includes
databases, critical business applications, and cloud services.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized
access due to compromised credentials, as an attacker would need a
second factor beyond just the password.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Draft, approve, and formally disseminate a
comprehensive AUP. The policy should clearly outline acceptable use of
company IT resources, internet access, email, mobile devices, data
handling procedures, and security expectations. This policy should be
integrated into new employee onboarding and reinforced through annual
security awareness training.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Establishes clear guidelines for employees,
reduces the likelihood of misuse of IT assets, mitigates insider
threats, and provides a legal framework for addressing policy
violations.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Secure Exposed SSH Service:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Implement robust security measures for the
identified SSH service:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Authentication:</strong> Disable password-based
authentication and exclusively use strong, key-based authentication
(e.g., RSA or ED25519 keys) with passphrases.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Access Control:</strong> Restrict SSH access to specific
trusted IP addresses or internal networks using firewall rules. Avoid
exposing SSH directly to the public internet unless absolutely
necessary, and if so, use a VPN or jump box.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Updates &amp; Patches:</strong> Ensure the SSH daemon
(e.g., OpenSSH) and the underlying operating system are kept fully
patched and up-to-date to protect against known
vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Configuration Hardening:</strong> Disable root login over
SSH, use strong ciphers and MACs, and disable X11 forwarding if not
required.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Monitoring:</strong> Implement robust logging and
monitoring for SSH access attempts, failed logins, and suspicious
activity, integrating this with a Security Information and Event
Management (SIEM) system.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Port Change (Optional Obfuscation):</strong> While not a
security measure itself, changing the default SSH port (22) to a
non-standard port can reduce the volume of automated scanning and
opportunistic attacks.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Reduces the attack surface, mitigates the risk
of brute-force attacks, and prevents unauthorized remote access,
protecting the integrity and confidentiality of the system.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>This cybersecurity posture assessment has provided valuable insights
into the current state of security for <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong>. While the organization demonstrates a commitment to some
foundational security practices, such as security awareness training and
MFA for basic access, critical gaps remain. Addressing the lack of MFA
for sensitive data systems, establishing an Employee Acceptable Use
Policy, and rigorously securing the exposed SSH service are paramount
next steps. By prioritizing these recommendations, <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong> can significantly mature its security posture, reduce its
attack surface, and build a stronger defense against evolving cyber
threats. Continuous monitoring and periodic reassessments are also
advised to maintain a robust security stance.</p>
