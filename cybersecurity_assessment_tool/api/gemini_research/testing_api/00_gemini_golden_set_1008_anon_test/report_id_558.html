<p><span><strong>Cybersecurity Posture Assessment Report</strong></span>
<span>For: <strong>[Organization Name]</strong></span> <span>Date:
2026-01-26</span> <span>Prepared by: Cybersecurity Analyst</span></p>
</div>
<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on an analysis of provided
organizational data, a recent network scan, and existing risk
information. The assessment aims to identify strengths, weaknesses, and
provide actionable recommendations to enhance the overall security
stance.</p>
<p>The organization demonstrates a commendable commitment to
foundational security controls, as evidenced by positive responses to
key security questionnaire items. This indicates a strong policy and
awareness framework in several critical areas.</p>
<p>The technical network scan, while limited in scope based on the
provided data, indicated that the specified target
<code>[Target IP]</code> had Port 80 (HTTP) in a <strong>closed</strong>
state. No other open ports or services were detected. This suggests a
potentially secure external footprint from the perspective of this
specific scan.</p>
<p>A notable discrepancy was identified between the current network scan
and pre-existing risk data. While the current scan reports Port 80 as
closed, a documented pre-existing risk indicates an "Unencrypted Web
Server" with Port 80 being open. This discrepancy requires immediate
investigation and validation to ensure an accurate understanding of the
current network state.</p>
<p>Overall, while the foundational controls appear robust, further
technical validation and reconciliation of conflicting information are
crucial next steps.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-security-controls">Analysis of
Security Controls</h2>
<p>All provided questionnaire responses indicate that
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong> has implemented critical security
controls, particularly around Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA),
acceptable use policies, and security awareness training. This forms a
strong foundation for protecting against common attack vectors and
fostering a security-conscious culture.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was conducted on the specified target to identify open
ports and services. The scan leveraged Nmap to probe the target’s
network interfaces.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> <code>[Scan Date]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Used:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="detailed-findings">Detailed Findings</h2>
<p>The scan performed against yielded limited findings:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 80 (HTTP):</strong> Identified as
<strong>closed</strong>. No service, product, or version information was
obtainable for this port due to its closed state.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Other Ports:</strong> No other open ports were detected
during this scan.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The absence of open ports indicates a potentially hardened external
surface for the scanned target. However, it is important to note that
this scan provides a snapshot of the observed target and its
public-facing posture, and may not encompass all internal systems or a
full range of potential vulnerabilities.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes findings from the security control review,
technical scan, and pre-existing risk data to provide a comprehensive
risk assessment.</p>
<h2 id="identified-gaps-from-questionnaire">Identified Gaps from
Questionnaire</h2>
<p>Based on the provided responses, no significant security control gaps
were identified from the questionnaire. The organization demonstrates
good adherence to foundational security practices concerning MFA,
acceptable use, and security awareness training.</p>
<h2 id="technical-vulnerabilities">Technical Vulnerabilities</h2>
<p>The current network scan identified Port 80 as
<strong>closed</strong> on the target <code>[Target IP]</code>. This is
a positive finding as it reduces the attack surface associated with
unencrypted web traffic. No other immediate technical vulnerabilities
were identified from this specific scan given its limited scope (only
one port was detailed).</p>
<h2 id="pre-existing-risks">Pre-existing Risks</h2>
<p>The following risk was provided as an existing vulnerability known to
the organization:</p>

</div>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="discrepancy-note">Discrepancy Note</h3>
<p>It is critical to highlight a direct contradiction between the
pre-existing risk information and the current technical scan results.
The "Unencrypted Web Server" risk is predicated on Port 80 being open,
while the recent network scan explicitly found Port 80 to be
<strong>closed</strong>. This discrepancy must be investigated
immediately to ascertain the correct current state of the network and to
ensure risk registers accurately reflect reality. Possible explanations
include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The pre-existing risk is outdated.</p></li>
<li><p>The target of the pre-existing risk is different from the target
scanned.</p></li>
<li><p>Network configurations have changed, leading to the closure of
Port 80.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Until resolved, the actual risk associated with an unencrypted web
server cannot be definitively assessed.</p>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are provided to
further strengthen the cybersecurity posture of <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="immediate-actions">Immediate Actions</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Resolve Port 80 Discrepancy:</strong> Immediately
investigate the contradiction between the current scan (Port 80 closed)
and the pre-existing risk (Port 80 open).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Validate the target scope of both the pre-existing risk and the
current scan.</p></li>
<li><p>Confirm the current status of Port 80 on all relevant
public-facing assets.</p></li>
<li><p>If Port 80 is indeed closed, update the risk register to reflect
its remediation or irrelevance. If it is open, reassess the risk and
prioritize mitigation efforts (e.g., implementing HTTPS, closing the
port if not needed).</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="strategic-recommendations">Strategic Recommendations</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Expand Technical Scans:</strong> While the current scan
was limited, consider conducting comprehensive vulnerability assessments
and penetration tests across the entire external and internal network
infrastructure. This should include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Full port scans on all known public IP ranges.</p></li>
<li><p>Authenticated vulnerability scanning of internal
systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Web application security testing for all public-facing
applications.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Continuous Security Awareness Training (SAT):</strong>
Maintain and evolve the existing security awareness training program.
Regular, engaging training tailored to current threats helps reinforce a
strong security culture.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Policy Review:</strong> Periodically review and
update the employee acceptable use policy and other security policies to
ensure they remain relevant to the evolving threat landscape and
organizational operations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>MFA Everywhere:</strong> While MFA is implemented for key
areas, review all systems and applications, especially those accessing
sensitive data or internal resources, to ensure MFA is universally
enforced wherever possible.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Maintain Detailed Asset Inventory:</strong> Ensure a
comprehensive and up-to-date inventory of all network assets, including
IP addresses, services, software versions, and their criticality. This
aids in effective vulnerability management and incident
response.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p><strong>[Organization Name]</strong> demonstrates a proactive stance
on cybersecurity through its robust implementation of foundational
security controls as identified in the questionnaire. However, the
discrepancy regarding Port 80 highlights the critical need for
continuous validation of security posture against both technical scans
and documented risks. By addressing the identified discrepancy and
implementing the strategic recommendations, the organization can further
strengthen its defenses against emerging threats and ensure a resilient
cybersecurity posture.</p>
