<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive assessment of the current
cybersecurity posture of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, derived
from a network scan, a security control questionnaire, and an analysis
of pre-existing vulnerabilities. The findings reveal critical risks,
including direct exposure of Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) services, a
notable absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for sensitive data
systems, and a significant gap in security awareness training for new
employees. These issues collectively represent a heightened risk
profile, necessitating immediate and strategic remediation efforts to
bolster the organization’s defense mechanisms.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-questionnaire-gaps">Analysis of
Questionnaire Gaps</h2>
<p>The "No" responses to critical security questions indicate the
following significant gaps:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> Failing
to enforce MFA for sensitive data systems drastically increases the risk
of unauthorized access. If an attacker compromises user credentials,
they could gain unimpeded access to critical organizational data without
a second factor of authentication.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong> The absence of initial security awareness training
for new hires means these individuals may lack fundamental knowledge of
cybersecurity threats and best practices. This oversight makes them more
susceptible to social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing) and other
common exploits, thereby increasing the risk of human error leading to
security incidents.</p></li>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of
Technical Findings</h2>
<p>The detection of an open Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) port (3389)
presents a critical security vulnerability. RDP is a widely targeted
service by threat actors for various malicious activities, including
brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, and exploitation of known RDP
vulnerabilities. The direct exposure of RDP to external networks is
considered a high-severity risk, regardless of whether specific
vulnerabilities were identified, as it provides an accessible entry
point for potential attackers. This finding directly correlates with an
identified pre-existing critical risk.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and fortify the cybersecurity posture
of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, the following actionable
recommendations are provided, prioritized by severity.</p>
<h2 id="immediate-actions-critical-risks">Immediate Actions (Critical
Risks)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Mitigate RDP Exposure:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Short-Term Fix:</strong> Immediately implement firewall
rules to restrict access to RDP (Port 3389) from external networks.
Allow connections only from trusted internal networks or specific,
whitelisted IP addresses if absolutely necessary.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Long-Term Fix:</strong> For any legitimate remote access
requirements, integrate a Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution. All
users requiring RDP access should first establish a VPN connection,
ensuring RDP services are never directly exposed to the public
internet.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication for
all access to systems that store, process, or transmit sensitive
organizational data. This will significantly reduce the risk of
unauthorized access, even if primary credentials are
compromised.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mid-term-actions-highmedium-risks">Mid-Term Actions (High/Medium
Risks)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Establish New Employee Security Awareness Training
Program:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop and integrate a comprehensive,
mandatory cybersecurity awareness training module into the onboarding
process for all new employees. This training should cover essential
topics such as identifying phishing attempts, best practices for
password management, understanding social engineering tactics, and
appropriate data handling procedures.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The cybersecurity posture of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>
exhibits critical vulnerabilities, particularly concerning RDP exposure,
the absence of MFA for sensitive data, and a gap in new employee
security training. Prompt and decisive action on the outlined
recommendations is crucial to significantly reduce the organization’s
attack surface and enhance its resilience against prevalent cyber
threats. Continuous monitoring, regular security assessments, and
ongoing employee education are vital for maintaining a robust and
adaptive security posture.</p>
