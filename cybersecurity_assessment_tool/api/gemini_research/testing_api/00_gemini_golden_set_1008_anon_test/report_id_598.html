<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings from a cybersecurity posture
assessment conducted for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The
assessment involved reviewing organizational security controls via a
questionnaire, analyzing network scan data, and evaluating existing risk
registers.</p>
<p>The current assessment reveals two primary areas of concern based on
the questionnaire: the lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
accessing sensitive data systems and the absence of annual security
awareness training for all employees. The provided network scan data
indicates no active services or open ports were identified on the target
‘‘, and no pre-existing vulnerabilities were listed in the supplied risk
register.</p>
<p>Overall, while technical exposure appears minimal based on the
provided scan (which may not be comprehensive), critical gaps exist in
fundamental security controls related to access management and
human-factor risk. Addressing these gaps is paramount to enhancing the
organization’s defensive capabilities against common cyber threats.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following information pertains to the client organization as

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-questionnaire-gaps">Analysis of
Questionnaire Gaps:</h2>
<p>Based on the questionnaire responses, two significant security gaps
were identified:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong>
Multi-factor authentication is not enforced for access to sensitive data
systems, significantly increasing the risk of unauthorized access should
primary credentials be compromised.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Insufficient Annual Security Awareness Training:</strong>
While new employees receive training, ongoing annual training for all
employees is not conducted. This leaves the organization vulnerable to
evolving social engineering tactics and reduces overall security posture
as employee knowledge may become outdated.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on the target ‘‘. The provided scan data
indicates that no active services or open ports were identified.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="summary-of-network-scan">Summary of Network
Scan:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target Scanned:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> No specific date was provided in the
metadata for the scan.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Findings:</strong> The scan metadata reported no active
services or open ports. This could indicate a well-secured perimeter, or
that the scan was limited in scope or returned no findings for the
specified target. Without further information or a more comprehensive
scan, it’s difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the external
attack surface.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section synthesizes the findings from the security control
review, technical scans, and any existing vulnerability information to
provide a comprehensive risk assessment.</p>

<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of MFA for Sensitive Data
Systems</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">High</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Unauthorized access to sensitive data
systems is possible with only a single factor (e.g., password),
significantly increasing the risk of data breaches or system compromise
if credentials are stolen or guessed.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;">Insufficient Annual Security Awareness
Training</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Medium</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Without regular, updated security
awareness training, employees are more susceptible to social engineering
attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) and may inadvertently introduce
malware or leak sensitive information, increasing the likelihood of
security incidents.</td>

</div>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the identified gaps and risks, the following recommendations
are provided to enhance the organization’s cybersecurity posture:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mandate Multi-Factor Authentication for all access to systems
containing sensitive data. This adds a critical layer of security,
making it significantly harder for unauthorized users to gain access
even if they obtain user credentials.</p></li>
<li><p>Review existing sensitive data systems and prioritize MFA rollout
based on data criticality and system exposure.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Comprehensive Annual Security Awareness
Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and implement a mandatory annual security awareness
training program for all employees, not just new hires.</p></li>
<li><p>The training should cover current threats such as phishing,
ransomware, social engineering tactics, secure browsing habits, and data
handling best practices.</p></li>
<li><p>Include regular simulated phishing exercises to test employee
awareness and reinforce training.</p></li>
</ul></li>
