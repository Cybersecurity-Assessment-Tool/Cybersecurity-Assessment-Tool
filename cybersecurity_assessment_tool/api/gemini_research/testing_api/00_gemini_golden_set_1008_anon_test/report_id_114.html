<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on a review of
organizational security controls, an external network scan, and an
assessment of existing risks.<br />
<br />
The organization demonstrates some foundational security practices, such
as requiring Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email access and
conducting annual security awareness training for all employees.
However, significant gaps were identified in critical areas: the absence
of MFA for computer login and sensitive data access, a lack of an
employee acceptable use policy, and no security awareness training for
new employees.<br />
<br />
Technically, the external network scan performed for this assessment
reported no open ports on the target <code>[Target IP]</code>,
indicating a minimal external attack surface at the time of the scan.
This finding notably contradicts a pre-existing risk identifying an
"Unencrypted Web Server" on Port 80, suggesting either a recent
remediation or an outdated risk assessment, which warrants immediate
re-validation.<br />
<br />
Overall, while the external technical exposure appears low, the
identified internal control gaps represent a high organizational risk,
potentially exposing sensitive data and systems to unauthorized access
and misuse. Recommendations focus on strengthening internal security
policies, training, and the comprehensive implementation of MFA.</p>

<h2 id="questionnaire-analysis">Questionnaire Analysis</h2>
<p>The review of security controls reveals several critical areas for
improvement:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MFA Gaps:</strong> While MFA is used for email, its
absence for computer login and sensitive data systems significantly
increases the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised
credentials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Policy Deficiencies:</strong> The lack of an employee
acceptable use policy means there are no clear guidelines for employees
on appropriate technology usage, potentially leading to misuse or
non-compliance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Training Omission:</strong> The absence of security
awareness training for new employees leaves them vulnerable to social
engineering attacks and unaware of critical security protocols from the
outset of their employment.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>

<h2 id="scan-findings">Scan Findings</h2>
<p>The Nmap scan reported that <strong>no open ports were
identified</strong> on the target <code>[Target IP]</code>. All scanned
ports were found to be in a <code>closed</code> state. This indicates a
highly restricted external network perimeter, significantly reducing the
external attack surface detectable through standard port scanning. No
services, products, or versions could be enumerated from this scan.</p>

<h2 id="correlation-and-overall-posture">Correlation and Overall
Posture</h2>
<p>The current cybersecurity posture for <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong> presents a mixed picture. While the external network
perimeter appears robust due to no open ports, the significant gaps in
internal security controls (MFA, AUP, new employee training) create
substantial internal risks. The discrepancy regarding the "Unencrypted
Web Server" highlights the importance of keeping vulnerability
assessments current and verifying findings, especially when new
technical scans provide conflicting data. The lack of these foundational
internal controls can lead to insider threats, successful phishing
attacks, and unauthorized access to critical systems and data, even if
external defenses are strong.</p>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based on the comprehensive assessment, the following actionable
recommendations are provided to enhance the cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Widely:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> Implement MFA for all computer logins
across the organization.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Priority:</strong> Implement MFA for access to all
sensitive data systems and applications.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create a clear, comprehensive AUP outlining the appropriate use
of company assets, networks, and data.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all employees read, understand, and formally acknowledge
the AUP.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Enhance Security Awareness Training
Programs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement mandatory security awareness training for all new
employees during their onboarding process. This should cover common
threats (phishing, malware), password hygiene, data handling, and the
AUP.</p></li>
<li><p>Continue and expand annual security awareness training for all
employees, ensuring content is updated to reflect current threat
landscapes.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Re-validate "Unencrypted Web Server"
Vulnerability:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Immediately investigate the "Unencrypted Web Server"
vulnerability (CVSS 5.0). Given that the recent Nmap scan shows Port 80
as closed, verify if this vulnerability has been remediated or if it
applies to an internal service not externally visible, or a different
asset.</p></li>
<li><p>If the service is indeed closed, update the organization’s
vulnerability management system to reflect its remediation.</p></li>
<li><p>If an unencrypted web service exists elsewhere, prioritize its
encryption (SSL/TLS implementation) or closure.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular Security Reviews:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Establish a schedule for regular internal and external security
assessments, penetration testing, and policy reviews to ensure ongoing
effectiveness of security controls.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Implementing these recommendations will significantly bolster the
organization’s defenses against both external and internal threats,
moving towards a more mature and resilient cybersecurity posture.</p>
