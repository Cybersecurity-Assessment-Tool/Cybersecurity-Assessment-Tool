<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This cybersecurity posture assessment reveals significant
vulnerabilities within the current operational environment. Critical
gaps include the complete absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
for email, computer login, and sensitive data systems, leaving key
access points highly susceptible to credential-based attacks.
Furthermore, the organization is operating an End-of-Life (EOL) web
server, Nginx 1.18.0, which presents a severe technical vulnerability
due to unpatched security flaws. These technical and procedural
deficiencies are compounded by a lack of comprehensive security
awareness training for both new and existing employees, increasing the
overall risk of successful phishing, social engineering, and
exploitation of known software vulnerabilities. Immediate and decisive
action is required to implement MFA across all critical systems, upgrade
outdated software, and establish robust, ongoing security awareness
programs to mitigate these high-priority risks.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The questionnaire results indicate
critical gaps in fundamental security practices. The lack of
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across email, computer login, and
sensitive data systems is a severe deficiency, leaving these critical
assets highly vulnerable to unauthorized access via compromised
credentials. Furthermore, the absence of regular security awareness
training, especially for new employees, significantly elevates the risk
of successful phishing, social engineering, and insider threats. The
presence of an acceptable use policy is positive, but its effectiveness
is diminished without accompanying training and technical controls.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">3. Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on on <code>2025-11-22T10:00:00Z</code>
to identify open ports and services.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Host Status:</strong> Up</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Ports and Services:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 443 (HTTPS):</strong></p>

<li><p><strong>Service:</strong> HTTPS</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Product:</strong> Nginx</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.18.0</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The scan identified an Nginx web server
running on port 443 (HTTPS) with version <code>1.18.0</code>. Nginx
version 1.18.0 was released in April 2020 and has since reached its
End-of-Life (EOL). This means it no longer receives security updates or
bug fixes. Operating EOL software poses a critical risk as it is highly
susceptible to known vulnerabilities that will not be patched by the
vendor. This exposes the web server to various attacks, including remote
code execution, denial of service, and information disclosure,
potentially leading to a compromise of the entire system or hosted
applications.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment">4. Risk Assessment</h1>
