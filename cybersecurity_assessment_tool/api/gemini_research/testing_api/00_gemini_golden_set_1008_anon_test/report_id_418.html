<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides an assessment of <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong>’s cybersecurity posture based on provided questionnaire
responses, an empty network scan, and an absence of pre-existing risk
data. Key strengths include the implementation of Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and sensitive data systems,
along with an annual security awareness training program for all
employees and an acceptable use policy. However, critical gaps were
identified: the lack of MFA for email access and the absence of
dedicated security awareness training for new employees. The network
scan did not identify any active services, which may indicate good
perimeter control or an incomplete scan. Recommendations prioritize
implementing MFA for email and establishing comprehensive onboarding
security training to address these significant vulnerabilities.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">6. Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and improve the overall cybersecurity
posture, the following actionable recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Access:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Mandate Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for
all user accounts accessing organizational email services. This should
include both cloud-based and on-premises email systems.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Significantly reduces the risk of successful
phishing attacks, credential stuffing, and unauthorized access, even if
user passwords are compromised.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Priority:</em> Critical</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Onboarding Security Awareness
Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> Develop and implement a mandatory, initial
cybersecurity awareness training program for all new employees, to be
completed as part of their onboarding process. This should cover common
threats like phishing, social engineering, and safe internet
practices.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Equips new hires with essential security
knowledge from day one, reducing their susceptibility to common attack
vectors and strengthening the organization’s human firewall.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Priority:</em> High</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Comprehensive Network Scans (If
Applicable):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Action:</em> If the target <code>[Target IP]</code> (or other
relevant external assets) is an active component of the organization’s
infrastructure, conduct thorough, authenticated network scans and
vulnerability assessments.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Benefit:</em> Provides a complete understanding of the
external attack surface, allowing for the identification and remediation
of unpatched vulnerabilities, misconfigured services, or unintentionally
exposed systems.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Priority:</em> Medium (if <code>[Target IP]</code> is in
scope for the organization)</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion">7. Conclusion</h1>
<p><strong>[Organization Name]</strong> demonstrates a foundational
commitment to security through existing MFA for sensitive systems and
annual security training. However, the identified gaps in MFA for email
access and initial security awareness training for new employees
represent significant vulnerabilities that could be exploited by
adversaries. Addressing these control weaknesses and gaining a clearer
understanding of the external network exposure through comprehensive
scanning are crucial next steps. Proactive implementation of the
recommended actions will substantially enhance the organization’s
resilience against common and evolving cyber threats, fostering a more
secure operational environment.</p>
