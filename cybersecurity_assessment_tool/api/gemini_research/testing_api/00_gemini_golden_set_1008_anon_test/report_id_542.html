<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings from a cybersecurity assessment
conducted for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The assessment
involved a review of organizational security controls via a
questionnaire, a targeted network scan of , and an incorporation of
pre-existing risk data.</p>
<p>Key findings indicate several critical vulnerabilities and
significant control gaps. Most notably, an outdated and misconfigured
FTP service was discovered on allowing anonymous access and containing
known critical vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the organization lacks
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for sensitive data systems and
exhibits substantial deficiencies in security awareness training for
employees. The existing risk data also highlights the use of outdated
operating systems (Windows 7) on workstations, further contributing to
the overall risk posture.</p>
<p>Immediate action is required to address these critical issues and
strengthen the organization’s overall security posture against known
threats and common attack vectors.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-control-gaps">Analysis of Control Gaps</h2>
<p>The questionnaire responses reveal the following significant control
gaps, which directly contribute to the organization’s risk profile:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Critical Gap: No MFA for Sensitive Data Systems.</strong>
The absence of Multi-Factor Authentication for systems handling
sensitive data significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access
due to credential compromise (e.g., phishing, brute-force
attacks).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>High Gap: Lack of Security Awareness Training for New
Employees.</strong> New employees are particularly susceptible to social
engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting) if they are not
adequately trained on security best practices and organizational
policies from the outset.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>High Gap: No Annual Security Awareness Training for All
Employees.</strong> Without regular, annual security awareness training,
employees may forget critical security protocols or remain unaware of
evolving threats. This makes the organization vulnerable to human-factor
exploits and compliance failures.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was performed on the target host on <strong>[Date of
Scan]</strong>. The scan identified the following open ports and
services:</p>
<h2 id="target">Target: </h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Port 21/tcp (FTP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Service:</strong> FTP</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Product:</strong> vsftpd</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Version:</strong> 2.3.4</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Script Output:</strong> ‘Anonymous FTP login
allowed‘</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="technical-vulnerabilities-identified">Technical Vulnerabilities
Identified</h2>
<p>The network scan revealed critical security vulnerabilities
associated with the FTP service hosted on :</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Critical: Anonymous FTP Access Enabled.</strong> The FTP
service on port 21 allows anonymous login without credentials. This
typically grants read/write access to certain directories, which can
lead to unauthorized data exposure, malicious file uploads, or use as a
staging ground for further attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Critical: Outdated vsftpd Version 2.3.4.</strong> vsftpd
version 2.3.4 is an extremely outdated software version, originally
released in 2011. It is known to contain critical vulnerabilities,
including a backdoor (CVE-2011-2523) that allows remote code execution.
This version has reached its end-of-life and should never be used in
production environments due to the severe security risks it
poses.</p></li>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified vulnerabilities and control gaps, the
following recommendations are provided. These actions are prioritized by
severity to guide remediation efforts.</p>
<h2 id="critical-recommendations">Critical Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Disable Anonymous FTP Access:</strong> Immediately
reconfigure the vsftpd service to disable anonymous login. Only
authenticated users with strong, unique credentials should be able to
access the FTP server, and access should be limited to necessary
directories.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade/Replace vsftpd Service:</strong> Upgrade vsftpd
to the latest stable and supported version. Alternatively, if FTP is
still required, consider replacing it with a more secure file transfer
solution such as SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) or SCP (Secure Copy
Protocol). If FTP functionality is not critical, the service should be
disabled and uninstalled entirely.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong>
Mandate Multi-Factor Authentication for all systems that process, store,
or transmit sensitive data. This crucial layer of defense significantly
reduces the risk of unauthorized access even if primary credentials are
compromised.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="high-recommendations">High Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Establish Comprehensive Security Awareness Training
Program:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>New Employee Training:</strong> Develop and implement
mandatory security awareness training as a core component of the
onboarding process for all new hires.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Annual Employee Training:</strong> Conduct mandatory
annual security awareness training for all employees. Topics should
cover current threats such as phishing, malware, ransomware, strong
password hygiene, proper data handling, and incident reporting
procedures.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade Outdated Operating Systems:</strong> Prioritize
and execute a comprehensive upgrade plan for all workstations currently
running Windows 7 to a supported operating system (e.g., Windows 10 or
Windows 11). Implement a robust patch management strategy to ensure all
systems are kept up-to-date with the latest security patches.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The cybersecurity assessment reveals a posture with significant
vulnerabilities and control weaknesses that demand urgent attention.
Addressing the critical issues related to the outdated and misconfigured
FTP service, the lack of MFA for sensitive data systems, alongside
improving security awareness training, and upgrading outdated operating
systems, will substantially enhance the organization’s defensive
capabilities and significantly reduce its overall risk exposure. A
proactive and continuous approach to cybersecurity, including regular
assessments and timely remediation, is essential for maintaining a
resilient and secure operational environment.</p>
