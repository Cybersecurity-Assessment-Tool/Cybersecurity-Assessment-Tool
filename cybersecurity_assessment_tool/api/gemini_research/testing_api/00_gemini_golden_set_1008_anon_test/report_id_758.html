<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings from a cybersecurity posture
assessment for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The assessment
involved reviewing existing security controls via a questionnaire,
analyzing network scan data, and correlating these with pre-existing
identified risks.</p>
<p>Key findings highlight several critical vulnerabilities and gaps in
the current security posture. Notably, the organization does not enforce
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive data systems,
representing a significant credential-based attack vector. Furthermore,
a network scan revealed an outdated FTP service allowing anonymous
access, posing a severe risk of unauthorized data exposure and potential
system compromise. Existing infrastructure running end-of-life operating
systems further exacerbates the overall risk profile.</p>
<p>Urgent recommendations include implementing MFA for all sensitive
data access, decommissioning or securing the FTP service, and upgrading
outdated operating systems to supported versions. Addressing these
issues will substantially enhance the organization’s defensive
capabilities against prevalent cyber threats.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-questionnaire-findings">Analysis
of Questionnaire Findings</h2>
<p>The most significant finding from the questionnaire is the lack of
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive data systems.
This represents a critical vulnerability, as compromised credentials
(e.g., via phishing) could grant an attacker direct access to sensitive
information without an additional layer of security. While MFA is
implemented for email and computer logins, its absence for critical data
systems leaves a gaping hole in the authentication strategy.</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="analysis-of-technical-findings">Analysis of
Technical Findings</h2>
<p>The discovery of an active FTP service (vsftpd version 2.3.4) on port
21, coupled with the allowance of anonymous logins, represents a
critical security vulnerability.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Outdated Software:</strong> vsftpd 2.3.4 is an extremely
old version, released in 2011. This version is known to have security
vulnerabilities (e.g., CVE-2011-2523, though the provided data does not
confirm this specific backdoor, the general age of the software implies
numerous unpatched flaws). Running such outdated software significantly
increases the risk of exploitation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Anonymous FTP Access:</strong> Allowing anonymous FTP
logins means anyone can connect to the service without credentials.
Depending on the configuration, this could expose sensitive files, allow
unauthorized file uploads (potentially malware), or provide
reconnaissance information to attackers. This is a severe configuration
error that should be rectified immediately.</p></li>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>The following recommendations are provided to address the identified
risks and enhance the overall cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. These actions should be
prioritized based on their severity and potential impact.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Mandate and enforce Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for all user access to systems and applications
that handle or store sensitive organizational data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Significantly reduces the risk of
unauthorized access and data breaches stemming from compromised
credentials.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Address FTP Service Vulnerabilities:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action 1:</strong> Immediately disable anonymous FTP
access and any unnecessary user accounts on the FTP server.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action 2:</strong> Evaluate the necessity of running an
FTP service. If file transfer capabilities are still required, migrate
to a more secure protocol such as SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol),
FTPS (FTP Secure), or utilize secure cloud-based file sharing
solutions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action 3:</strong> If legacy FTP is absolutely
unavoidable for specific business processes, ensure it is tightly
access-controlled (e.g., restricted by IP, strong authentication),
isolated to an internal network segment, and regularly monitored for
suspicious activity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Eliminates a critical unauthorized
access vector, prevents data exposure, and protects against system
compromise.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade End-of-Life Operating Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Develop and execute a plan to upgrade
all workstations and servers currently running Windows 7 (or any other
end-of-life operating system) to a currently supported version (e.g.,
Windows 10 or 11).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Ensures systems receive critical
security patches and updates, protecting against known vulnerabilities
and improving overall system stability and performance.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>This assessment reveals that while <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong> has some foundational security controls in place (e.g.,
AUP, security awareness training), critical vulnerabilities exist that
could lead to significant security incidents. The lack of MFA for
sensitive data, the presence of an outdated and insecure FTP service,
and the continued use of end-of-life operating systems are high-priority
issues that require immediate attention. By diligently implementing the
recommendations outlined in this report, the organization can
significantly mature its cybersecurity posture and better defend against
evolving threats.</p>
