<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings from a cybersecurity posture
assessment conducted for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The
assessment involved reviewing organizational security controls via a
questionnaire, performing a targeted network scan, and reviewing any
pre-existing vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>The network scan of identified no open ports, which is a positive
indicator of a potentially hardened external perimeter or effective
network segmentation. However, the internal control review revealed
several critical gaps. Specifically, the organization currently lacks
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins, does not have an
employee acceptable use policy (AUP), and fails to implement regular
security awareness training for both new and existing employees.</p>
<p>These identified control deficiencies represent significant risks to
the organization’s overall security posture, potentially increasing
susceptibility to unauthorized access, internal threats, and successful
phishing/social engineering attacks. Recommendations provided within
this report aim to address these critical areas and enhance the
organization’s cybersecurity defenses.</p>

<h2 id="port-scan-findings">Port Scan Findings</h2>
<p>The Nmap scan performed on identified no open ports. This suggests
that the target host is either well-protected by a firewall,
intentionally configured to not expose services on standard ports, or
was non-responsive to the scan probes. While this is a positive finding
indicating no immediately obvious external attack surface, it is
important to verify the scope and completeness of the scan, as well as
the target’s expected network posture.</p>

<p>Based on the security control review and technical scan, the

<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Lack of MFA for Computer Logins</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Without MFA, user credentials (passwords)
alone are sufficient to gain access to computers. This significantly
increases the risk of successful brute-force attacks, credential
stuffing, or phishing leading to unauthorized access.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Absence of Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP)</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">A lack of a clear AUP means employees may
be unaware of permissible and impermissible use of company IT resources,
potentially leading to misuse, data breaches, or compliance
violations.</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">High</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">No New Employee Security Awareness
Training</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">New employees without proper security
awareness training are more susceptible to social engineering, phishing,
and malware, posing an immediate threat to organizational security from
day one.</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">High</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">No Annual Security Awareness Training</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Without regular, recurring security
awareness training, employees’ knowledge of current threats and best
practices can degrade, increasing the likelihood of human error leading
to security incidents.</td>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and enhance the overall
cybersecurity posture of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, the
following recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Computer
Logins</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Roll out MFA for all user accounts accessing company computers
and systems. This significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access
even if passwords are compromised.</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluate solutions such as smart cards, biometric authentication,
or authenticator apps for implementation.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Employee Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create a comprehensive AUP that clearly defines the rules for
using company IT assets, networks, and data.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all employees read, understand, and formally acknowledge
the AUP upon hiring and periodically thereafter.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Introduce Mandatory Security Awareness Training for New
Employees</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Establish a mandatory security awareness training program for all
new hires as part of their onboarding process.</p></li>
<li><p>Training should cover topics such as phishing, social
engineering, password best practices, data handling, and reporting
suspicious activities.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Annual Security Awareness Training for All
Employees</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement a recurring, mandatory annual security awareness
training program for all employees.</p></li>
<li><p>Content should be updated regularly to reflect current threat
landscapes and provide practical examples relevant to the
organization.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Regularly Review and Update Security
Policies</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Establish a schedule for regular review and updates of all
security policies and procedures (including the new AUP) to ensure they
remain relevant and effective.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Consider Deeper Technical Assessments</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>While no open ports were found, consider internal vulnerability
scans and penetration testing to assess the security of internal
networks and applications.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct targeted scans against specific expected services if
there was an intended target that should have shown open ports.</p></li>
</ul></li>
