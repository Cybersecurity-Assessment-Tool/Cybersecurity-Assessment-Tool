<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This document outlines the findings of a cybersecurity assessment
conducted for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The assessment
incorporated three primary data sources: a security control
questionnaire, a network vulnerability scan, and a review of existing
organizational risks. The objective is to identify critical security
gaps, technical vulnerabilities, and provide actionable recommendations
to enhance the client’s cybersecurity defenses.</p>

<h1 id="security-control-review-questionnaire-analysis">Security Control
Review (Questionnaire Analysis)</h1>
<p>A review of the provided security questionnaire responses highlights
several critical areas requiring immediate attention. The lack of
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer login, coupled
with insufficient annual security awareness training, represents
significant vulnerabilities that increase the organization’s overall
risk profile.</p>

<h2 id="key-findings-from-questionnaire">Key Findings from
Questionnaire</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Critical Gap: Lack of MFA for Email Access:</strong> Not
requiring MFA for email access significantly increases the risk of
account compromise through phishing, credential stuffing, or brute-force
attacks. Email is a primary vector for initial compromise and often
holds keys to other systems (e.g., password resets).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Critical Gap: Lack of MFA for Computer Login:</strong>
Similar to email, not requiring MFA for computer login leaves endpoints
vulnerable to unauthorized access. This can lead to lateral movement
within the network, data exfiltration, and the deployment of
malware.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>High Risk: Inadequate Annual Security Awareness
Training:</strong> While new employees receive initial training, the
absence of annual refresher training means employees may forget best
practices, miss updates on new threats, or become complacent over time.
This erodes the human firewall, making the organization more susceptible
to social engineering attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Positive Controls:</strong> The organization does have an
acceptable use policy and provides security awareness training for new
employees, which are good foundational steps. MFA for sensitive data
systems is also a positive control, though consistency across all
critical access points is crucial for comprehensive protection.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>A limited network scan was conducted on the designated target .</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target:</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scanner Used:</strong> Nmap</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="nmap-scan-summary">Nmap Scan Summary</h2>
<p>The Nmap scan reported that the target is <strong>Up</strong>, but no
open ports were identified. All scanned ports were reported as
<strong>closed</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="detailed-port-scan-findings">Detailed Port Scan Findings</h3>
<p>No open ports or services were discovered on the target during this
assessment. This suggests that the external attack surface for the
scanned target is minimal or well-hardened against basic reconnaissance.
However, it is crucial to understand that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This was a limited scan and may not cover all possible ports or
hidden services.</p></li>
<li><p>A lack of open ports does not equate to a lack of
vulnerabilities, especially internal ones.</p></li>
<li><p>The target may have other services exposed via different IP
addresses or domains not included in this scan.</p></li>
<li><p>This scan did not include vulnerability enumeration, only port
state.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>This section correlates findings from the questionnaire and technical
scan to present an overall risk profile. Given the provided inputs, the
primary risks stem from organizational control deficiencies identified
in the security questionnaire, as no pre-existing vulnerabilities were
provided, and the network scan did not reveal any immediate technical
exposures.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To significantly improve the cybersecurity posture of
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, the following recommendations are
provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Universally:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Deploy and enforce MFA for all email accounts, ideally leveraging
modern methods like FIDO2 security keys, authenticator apps (e.g.,
TOTP/HOTP), or certificate-based authentication.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement MFA for all corporate computer logins, especially for
administrative accounts, remote access solutions (VPN, RDP), and single
sign-on (SSO) systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Review and ensure MFA is consistently applied to all sensitive
data systems and critical business applications, maintaining a unified
authentication strategy.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish Mandatory Annual Security Awareness
Training:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and implement a comprehensive, mandatory annual security
awareness training program for all employees, regardless of tenure or
role.</p></li>
<li><p>Training content should be engaging and include current threat
landscapes, phishing simulations, ransomware awareness, secure data
handling best practices, and clear incident reporting
procedures.</p></li>
<li><p>Track completion rates, assess effectiveness through quizzes or
simulated attacks, and conduct follow-up training for non-compliant
individuals.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Advanced Vulnerability Assessments and
Penetration Testing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>While the basic Nmap scan showed no open ports, this is not an
exhaustive assessment. Engage in regular, in-depth vulnerability
assessments and penetration tests (both external and internal) to
identify more subtle configuration weaknesses, application
vulnerabilities, and potential misconfigurations that basic scans might
miss.</p></li>
<li><p>If the organization hosts any public-facing applications (web,
mobile, API), conduct specialized web application security
testing.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Review and Update Security Policies
Regularly:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Periodically review and update the acceptable use policy,
information security policy, and other relevant security policies to
reflect current threats, regulatory requirements, and organizational
changes.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure policies are communicated effectively, understood by all
employees, and regularly reinforced.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The current cybersecurity posture of <strong>[Organization
Name]</strong> indicates significant vulnerabilities primarily due to
the lack of foundational security controls like Multi-Factor
Authentication for email and computer access, and inconsistent security
awareness training. While external network reconnaissance yielded no
immediately apparent technical weaknesses, this should not breed
complacency, as the scan was limited in scope. Addressing the identified
gaps through the recommended actions is crucial for mitigating risks,
enhancing resilience against evolving cyber threats, and fostering a
stronger security culture within the organization.</p>
