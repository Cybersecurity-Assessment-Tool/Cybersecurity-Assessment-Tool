<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report presents a cybersecurity posture assessment for
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on an external network scan
and a review of foundational security controls. The assessment
identifies significant deficiencies in critical security areas,
including the absence of multi-factor authentication for computer
logins, a lack of essential security policies (e.g., Acceptable Use
Policy), and fundamental gaps in employee security awareness training.
Furthermore, an outdated Nginx web server has been identified, posing a
risk of exposure to known vulnerabilities. These findings indicate a
high overall risk posture, necessitating immediate and comprehensive
remediation efforts to safeguard organizational assets and data.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-information">Organizational Information</h1>
<p>The following organizational details were used for the assessment.
Where specific data was not provided, placeholders have been used to
maintain the report’s structure.</p>

<code>[Client IP]</code></p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="security-control-review">Security Control Review</h1>
<p>A review of the organization’s adherence to basic security practices,
informed by the provided questionnaire responses, revealed several
critical gaps. The table below summarizes these findings:</p>

</table>
</div>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The questionnaire responses highlight
severe deficiencies in fundamental security controls. The absence of
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for computer logins presents a high
risk for unauthorized system access through compromised credentials.
Furthermore, the complete lack of an employee acceptable use policy and
any form of security awareness training (for new hires or annually)
indicates a significant organizational vulnerability to social
engineering, phishing attacks, and insider threats. These gaps
collectively suggest a low level of security maturity and an elevated
risk profile.</p>
<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>An external network scan was performed on <code>[Target IP]</code> on
. The scan identified the following active services and open ports:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Target:</strong> <code>[Target IP]</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> 2025-11-22</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Port: 443/TCP (HTTPS)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Service:</strong> HTTPS</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Product:</strong> Nginx</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.18.0</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The scan revealed that port 443, commonly
used for secure web traffic (HTTPS), is open and running Nginx version
1.18.0. Nginx 1.18.0 was released in April 2020. As of late 2024 / early
2025, this version is significantly outdated. Modern stable Nginx
releases are typically in the 1.24.x or 1.26.x series. Running outdated
software increases the risk of exploitation through publicly known
vulnerabilities that have been patched in newer versions. While specific
critical CVEs for Nginx 1.18.0 would require deeper vulnerability
scanning, the general practice of maintaining current software versions
is a foundational security control.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the security questionnaire and technical
scan results, the following risks have been identified:</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and significantly improve the
organization’s cybersecurity posture, the following actionable
recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for All Login Points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mandate Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all computer
logins, in addition to email and sensitive data systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluate and implement MFA for any other critical internal or
external applications accessible to employees.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create a comprehensive AUP that clearly defines the rules and
expectations for employee use of company IT assets, networks, and
data.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure all employees read, understand, and formally acknowledge
the AUP upon hiring and periodically thereafter.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish a Robust Security Awareness Training
Program:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement mandatory security awareness training for all new
employees as part of their onboarding process. This should cover common
threats (e.g., phishing), password hygiene, and the AUP.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct mandatory annual security awareness training for all
employees. This training should be engaging, up-to-date with current
threat landscapes, and include simulated phishing exercises.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Upgrade and Maintain Software Versions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Immediately plan and execute an upgrade of the Nginx web server
to the latest stable release (e.g., Nginx 1.26.x or newer).</p></li>
<li><p>Establish a regular patch management program to ensure all
operating systems, applications, and network devices are kept up-to-date
with security patches and the latest stable versions.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Regular Vulnerability Scanning:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Conduct periodic vulnerability scans on all external and
internal-facing assets to identify new weaknesses before they can be
exploited.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider engaging in regular penetration testing to simulate
real-world attacks and validate security controls.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop Incident Response Plan:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create and regularly update an Incident Response Plan (IRP) to
ensure the organization can effectively detect, respond to, and recover
from cybersecurity incidents.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct tabletop exercises to test the IRP and ensure key
personnel are familiar with their roles and responsibilities.</p></li>
