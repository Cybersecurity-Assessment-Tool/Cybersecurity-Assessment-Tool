<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides an assessment of the current cybersecurity
posture for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, based on an
organizational security questionnaire review, technical scan results,
and an evaluation of provided existing risks. While the organization
demonstrates strengths in implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
for email and computer logins, and maintaining an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP) alongside annual security awareness training, critical gaps have
been identified.</p>
<p>Key findings include a lack of MFA for sensitive data systems and the
absence of a dedicated security awareness training program for new
employees. No network scan data or pre-existing vulnerability
information was supplied for this assessment, limiting the technical
depth of this report to the provided questionnaire responses. Addressing
the identified gaps in MFA for sensitive data and new employee security
awareness training is crucial to enhancing the overall security posture
and mitigating potential risks associated with unauthorized access and
human-factor vulnerabilities.</p>

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To address the identified risks and enhance the overall cybersecurity
posture, the following recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for All Sensitive Data
Systems</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Prioritize the implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) for all systems that handle, store, or process sensitive
organizational data.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct an inventory of all sensitive data systems and integrate
MFA solutions as a mandatory login requirement.</p></li>
<li><p>Review and update access control policies to enforce MFA across
these critical assets.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish New Employee Security Awareness
Training</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop and implement a mandatory security awareness training
program specifically for all new employees as part of their onboarding
process.</p></li>
<li><p>The training should cover essential topics such as phishing
identification, password best practices, acceptable use policy (AUP)
review, reporting suspicious activities, and data handling
procedures.</p></li>
<li><p>Regular refresher training should be incorporated as part of the
annual security awareness program for all employees.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>These recommendations, if implemented diligently, will significantly
strengthen the organization’s defenses against common attack vectors and
improve its overall security resilience.</p>
