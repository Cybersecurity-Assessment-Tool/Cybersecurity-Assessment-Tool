<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report details the findings of a cybersecurity posture
assessment for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>. The assessment was
primarily based on an organizational security questionnaire, as well as
provided (though empty) network scan data and pre-existing risk
information. While some essential controls, such as Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for email access and annual security awareness
training, are reportedly in place, significant gaps were identified.
Specifically, the absence of MFA for computer logins and sensitive data
systems, the lack of an Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), and the
failure to conduct security awareness training for new employees
represent considerable and critical risks to the organization. Immediate
action is recommended to address these fundamental security
deficiencies.</p>

<h1 id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan Results</h1>
<p>The provided network scan data (‘Input_1_Network_Scan_JSON‘) was
empty, indicating that no active hosts were identified during the scan,
or the scan itself did not yield any technical findings. Therefore, no
technical vulnerabilities related to open ports, services, or software
versions could be assessed through this method.</p>
<h1 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Based on the analysis of the security control questionnaire, several
high-priority risks have been identified. These risks represent critical
vulnerabilities in the organization’s security posture that could be
exploited by malicious actors. No pre-existing vulnerabilities were
provided in ‘Input_3_Current_Risks_JSON‘, so the following table
reflects risks derived from the questionnaire analysis.</p>

<td style="text-align: left;">Without Multi-Factor Authentication for

<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To mitigate the identified risks and significantly enhance the
overall cybersecurity posture of <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>,
the following actionable recommendations are provided:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Computer Logins:</strong> Immediately
implement Multi-Factor Authentication for all computer logins across the
organization. This adds a crucial second layer of security,
significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access even if primary
credentials are stolen or guessed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Sensitive Data Systems:</strong> Deploy
MFA for all systems that process or store sensitive organizational data.
This is critical for protecting high-value assets and ensuring
compliance with relevant data protection regulations and industry
standards.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Implement an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a comprehensive AUP that clearly outlines
employee responsibilities and acceptable conduct when using company
resources. Ensure all employees read, understand, and formally
acknowledge this policy annually.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement Security Awareness Training for New
Employees:</strong> Establish a mandatory and comprehensive security
awareness training program for all new hires as part of their onboarding
process. This initial training should cover common threats (e.g.,
phishing, social engineering), organizational security policies, and
best practices to foster a security-conscious culture from day
one.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Regular and Comprehensive Security
Assessments:</strong> While this assessment highlighted critical policy
and procedural gaps, it is imperative to conduct regular technical
security assessments, including network vulnerability scans and
penetration tests, to proactively identify and remediate network and
application vulnerabilities as they emerge.</p></li>
