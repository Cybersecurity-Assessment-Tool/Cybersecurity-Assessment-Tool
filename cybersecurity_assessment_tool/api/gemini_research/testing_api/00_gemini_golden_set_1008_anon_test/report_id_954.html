<h1 class="unnumbered" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This report provides a comprehensive cybersecurity posture assessment
for <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>, integrating findings from a
security control questionnaire, a targeted network scan, and an existing
risk register.</p>
<p>Strengths identified include the implementation of Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA) for computer logins and access to sensitive data
systems, along with initial security awareness training for new
employees. However, critical gaps persist, notably the absence of MFA
for email access, the lack of a formal employee acceptable use policy,
and the infrequent provision of annual security awareness training for
all staff.</p>
<p>Technically, a scan of the target <code>[Target IP]</code> revealed
no open ports, indicating a commendable minimal attack surface for this
specific asset. While a pre-existing risk highlighted a potential
"Unencrypted Web Server" related to Port 80, the current scan confirms
this port is closed on the assessed target. This report details these
findings and proposes actionable recommendations to bolster
<strong>[Organization Name]</strong>’s security posture.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="technical-scan-results">Technical Scan
Results</h1>
<p>A network scan was executed to identify the exposure of services and
open ports on a designated target.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan Date:</strong> N/A (Scan metadata did not include a
specific date.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Target IP Address:</strong>

</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="findings-summary">Findings Summary</h2>
<p>The Nmap scan of <code>[Target IP]</code> identified no open ports.
Specifically, Port 80 was found to be <code>closed</code>. This outcome
suggests a robust security posture for this particular asset,
demonstrating a minimal network attack surface. No services, products,
or versions were identified given the closed port state.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="discrepancy-note">Discrepancy Note</h2>
<p>It is important to address a discrepancy between the current scan
results and an existing risk in the provided data. The risk register
lists "Unencrypted Web Server" with an overview stating "Port 80 is
open." However, the Nmap scan performed on <code>[Target IP]</code>
clearly shows Port 80 as <code>closed</code>. This finding mitigates the
specific instance of "Unencrypted Web Server" risk for
<code>[Target IP]</code> at the time of this assessment. It is plausible
that this risk applies to other organizational assets not included in
this scan, or it represents a historical vulnerability that has since
been remediated on the scanned target.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>The following risks have been identified through the comprehensive
analysis of security controls, technical scan data, and the existing
vulnerability register:</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
<p>To strengthen <strong>[Organization Name]</strong>’s cybersecurity
posture and address the identified risks, the following actionable
recommendations are provided:</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="multi-factor-authentication-mfa">Multi-Factor
Authentication (MFA)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Implement MFA for Email Access:</strong> Prioritize the
immediate deployment and mandatory enforcement of Multi-Factor
Authentication for all employee email accounts. This is a fundamental
control against common and effective credential-based attacks.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="policies-procedures">Policies &amp;
Procedures</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Develop and Enforce an Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP):</strong> Create a comprehensive AUP that clearly defines the
appropriate use of all organizational IT resources, including networks,
systems, software, and data. Ensure all employees are required to read,
understand, and formally acknowledge this policy, with regular reviews
and updates.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="security-awareness-training-sat">Security
Awareness Training (SAT)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Annual Security Awareness Training for All
Employees:</strong> Supplement existing training for new hires with
mandatory, organization-wide annual security awareness training. This
training should cover the latest threat landscapes, social engineering
techniques, data handling best practices, and organizational security
policies to foster a culture of cybersecurity vigilance.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="technical-controls">Technical Controls</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Maintain Minimal Attack Surface:</strong> Continue to
ensure that all external-facing systems expose only strictly necessary
services. Regularly audit external network perimeters to verify that no
unnecessary ports are open and that services are properly configured and
secured.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Verify Web Service Security Across All Assets:</strong>
Given the historical "Unencrypted Web Server" risk, conduct a thorough
audit of all web-facing assets within the organization (beyond just the
scanned <code>[Target IP]</code>). Ensure that all applicable web
services enforce secure communication protocols (HTTPS/SSL/TLS) and that
no sensitive data is transmitted over unencrypted channels. Remediate
any findings by enforcing encryption, implementing redirects, or
decommissioning unnecessary services.</p></li>
