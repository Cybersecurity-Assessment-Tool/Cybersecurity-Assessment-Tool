<p>Cybersecurity Readiness Report for Apex Innovations
Date: October 14, 2025</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Overview
This report provides an assessment of the cybersecurity readiness of Apex Innovations, based on a combination of a self-reported security questionnaire and external technical scans, including DNS record analysis and network port scanning. The evaluation indicates a mature and robust security posture, with strong controls implemented across email security, user authentication, and network perimeter defense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Organizational Information</p>
</li>
<li>Organization Name: Apex Innovations</li>
<li>Email Domain: apexinnovations.com</li>
<li>Website Domain: www.apexinnovations.com</li>
<li>External IP / Web Host: 72.21.196.160</li>
<li>DNS Hosting: Self-hosted (ns1.apexinnovations.com, ns2.apexinnovations.com)</li>
<li>
<p>Email Service Provider: Microsoft 365 (as per SPF record)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Security Questionnaire Review
Security Control | Status
--- | ---
MFA for Email | Yes
MFA for Computer Login | Yes
MFA for Sensitive Systems | Yes
Acceptable Use Policy | Yes
New Employee Security Awareness Training | Yes
Annual All-Employee Security Training | Yes</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Summary: Apex Innovations reports complete adherence to fundamental cybersecurity policies. The mandatory implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all critical access points, combined with a comprehensive security awareness training program, signifies a strong, policy-driven commitment to mitigating risk.</p>
<ol>
<li>DNS &amp; Email Security</li>
<li>SPF Record: The organization has a correctly configured SPF record: "v=spf1 include:spf.protection.outlook.com -all". The use of "-all" (Hard Fail) is a best practice that helps prevent email spoofing by strictly defining authorized sending sources.</li>
<li>DMARC Record: A strong DMARC policy is in place: "v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:dmarc_reports@apexinnovations.com; fo=1". The "p=reject" policy instructs receiving email servers to reject messages that fail authentication, providing excellent protection against phishing and domain impersonation attacks.</li>
<li>DNS and MX Records: The organization manages its own DNS and mail exchange (MX) servers. This configuration, paired with the use of a secure third-party provider (Microsoft 365) for email delivery, demonstrates a well-architected and secure email infrastructure.</li>
</ol>
<p>Conclusion: The email security configuration for apexinnovations.com is excellent and aligns with modern best practices, providing strong defenses against common email-based threats.</p>
<ol>
<li>Port Scanning Results</li>
<li>Website / External IP (72.21.196.160):</li>
<li>Port 80 (HTTP): Open</li>
<li>Port 443 (HTTPS): Open</li>
<li>
<p>Summary: The external network scan of the organization's primary IP address shows that only standard web service ports are open. This indicates a properly configured firewall that limits the external attack surface, adhering to the principle of least privilege.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Risk Assessment &amp; Readiness Summary
Category | Status | Notes
--- | --- | ---
Authentication Security | Strong | MFA is consistently required across the organization.
Email Security | Strong | SPF and DMARC are implemented with a strict "reject" policy.
Network Exposure | Secure | Minimal services are exposed; only standard web ports are open.
Policy &amp; Training | Comprehensive | Foundational policies and regular training programs are in place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recommendations
While Apex Innovations exhibits a strong security posture, the following recommendations are made for continuous improvement:</p>
</li>
<li>Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF): Since the organization hosts its own website, a WAF would provide critical protection against application-layer attacks like SQL injection and cross-site scripting.</li>
<li>Verify DKIM Implementation: To complete the email authentication triad (SPF, DKIM, DMARC), ensure that DKIM is correctly configured for all authorized sending services.</li>
<li>Conduct Regular Vulnerability Scanning: For all self-hosted infrastructure (web server, DNS), perform regular vulnerability assessments to identify and remediate potential security weaknesses before they can be exploited.</li>
<li>
<p>Develop and Test an Incident Response Plan: Formalize a comprehensive incident response plan and conduct regular tabletop exercises to ensure the organization can respond effectively to a security breach.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conclusion
Apex Innovations demonstrates a high level of cybersecurity readiness. The organization has successfully implemented critical controls for authentication, email security, and network defense. By focusing on the continuous improvement of its self-hosted services and formalizing response procedures, Apex Innovations can further enhance its already robust security posture.</p>
