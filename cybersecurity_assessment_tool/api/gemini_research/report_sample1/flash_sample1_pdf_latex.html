<pre><code>Cybersecurity Readiness Report for Apex Innovations
Date: October 14, 2025

1. Overview
This report provides an evaluation of Apex Innovations' cybersecurity posture, derived from a security questionnaire, DNS records analysis (including DMARC), and external port scans of their public-facing infrastructure. The organization demonstrates a robust foundational security stance across critical areas such as user authentication, email protection, and employee awareness, with a well-managed external network presence.

2. Organizational Information
\begin{itemize}
    \item Organization Name: Apex Innovations
    \item Email Domain: apexinnovations.com
    \item Website Domain: www.apexinnovations.com
    \item External IP (Website/Firewall): 72.21.196.160
\end{itemize}

3. Security Questionnaire Review
Apex Innovations reports a comprehensive adoption of key cybersecurity policies and practices:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Security Control} &amp; \textbf{Status} \\
\hline
MFA for Email Access &amp; \(\checkmark\) Yes \\
\hline
MFA for Computer Login &amp; \(\checkmark\) Yes \\
\hline
MFA for Sensitive Data Systems &amp; \(\checkmark\) Yes \\
\hline
Employee Acceptable Use Policy &amp; \(\checkmark\) Yes \\
\hline
New Employee Security Awareness Training &amp; \(\checkmark\) Yes \\
\hline
Annual All-Employee Security Training &amp; \(\checkmark\) Yes \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Summary: The organization has implemented crucial controls for user authentication (Multi-Factor Authentication), acceptable use, and ongoing security awareness training. This indicates a strong commitment to managing human risk factors and enforcing security policies.

4. DNS &amp; Email Security
DNS Records
\begin{itemize}
    \item The primary A record for apexinnovations.com resolves to 72.21.196.160, matching the external IP identified in port scans.
    \item Name Servers (NS) are ns1.apexinnovations.com and ns2.apexinnovations.com, suggesting self-managed DNS or a provider managing DNS on their behalf with custom nameservers.
\end{itemize}

MX Records (Email)
\begin{itemize}
    \item MX records (mx1.apexinnovations.com, mx2.apexinnovations.com) indicate email services are handled by Apex Innovations' infrastructure or a dedicated provider.
    \item SPF record is correctly configured: \texttt{v=spf1 include:spf.protection.outlook.com -all}. This record explicitly authorizes Microsoft 365 (Outlook.com) as a legitimate sender for Apex Innovations' email and uses a strict \texttt{-all} policy to reject unauthorized senders, significantly reducing email spoofing risks.
\end{itemize}

DMARC Record
\begin{itemize}
    \item A valid DMARC record is present with a strong enforcement policy: \texttt{v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:dmarc\_reports@apexinnovations.com; fo=1}. The \texttt{p=reject} policy instructs receiving mail servers to reject messages that fail DMARC authentication, offering robust protection against phishing and brand impersonation. The \texttt{rua} tag ensures DMARC reports are sent to the organization for monitoring.
\end{itemize}
Conclusion: Apex Innovations demonstrates an excellent email security posture, with correctly configured SPF and DMARC records (using a reject policy), leveraging a reputable email service provider (Microsoft 365).

5. Port Scanning Results
Website / External IP (72.21.196.160)
\begin{itemize}
    \item Port 80 (HTTP): Open
    \item Port 443 (HTTPS): Open
\end{itemize}
These ports are typically open for a publicly accessible website, indicating that Apex Innovations is hosting web services on this IP address. The consistent results from both &quot;port_scan_external_ip&quot; and &quot;port_scan_web&quot; confirm that the external IP is directly associated with the website. While these ports are necessary for web presence, the security of the web server and application behind them is crucial.

6. Risk Assessment &amp; Readiness Summary
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Category} &amp; \textbf{Status} &amp; \textbf{Notes} \\
\hline
Authentication Security &amp; \(\checkmark\) Strong &amp; MFA is required for email, computer login, and sensitive data systems. \\
\hline
Email Security &amp; \(\checkmark\) Strong &amp; Comprehensive SPF and DMARC with a &quot;reject&quot; policy implemented, leveraging Microsoft 365. \\
\hline
Network Exposure &amp; \(\triangle\) Moderate &amp; Ports 80 and 443 are open for web services. This is expected but requires vigilant security practices for the underlying web server and application. No other unnecessary ports appear to be open. \\
\hline
Web Hosting &amp; \(\triangle\) Acceptable &amp; Web services are exposed via HTTP/HTTPS. The security posture depends on the hardening and patching of the web server and web application. \\
\hline
Policy &amp; \(\checkmark\) Comprehensive &amp; Acceptable Use Policy is in place. \\
\hline
Training &amp; \(\checkmark\) Comprehensive &amp; Regular security awareness training for all employees. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

7. Recommendations
While Apex Innovations exhibits a strong cybersecurity foundation, continuous improvement is vital. We recommend the following:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Web Application Security:} Given that ports 80 and 443 are open, implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect against common web exploits. Conduct regular web application vulnerability scanning and penetration testing. Ensure web servers are hardened, patched regularly, and configured securely.
    \item \textbf{Verify DKIM:} Although SPF and DMARC are robustly configured, ensure DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) is also active for all sending email domains to provide another layer of email authentication.
    \item \textbf{Incident Response Plan:} Develop, document, and regularly test a comprehensive cybersecurity incident response plan and disaster recovery procedures to ensure business continuity in the event of a breach.
    \item \textbf{Regular Vulnerability Assessments:} Conduct routine internal and external vulnerability assessments and penetration tests across the entire network infrastructure, not just the web presence, to identify and remediate potential weaknesses.
    \item \textbf{Asset Inventory and Management:} Maintain a current, detailed inventory of all hardware and software assets, and implement a robust patch management program to ensure all systems are up-to-date.
\end{enumerate}

8. Conclusion
Apex Innovations demonstrates a commendable level of cybersecurity readiness, particularly in critical areas such as multi-factor authentication, email security, and employee training. The organization's proactive stance on DMARC enforcement (\texttt{p=reject}) and comprehensive policy framework are significant strengths. While network exposure for web services is a necessary aspect of doing business, continuous vigilance and proactive measures for web application security will further enhance their overall cybersecurity posture. Maintaining these strong practices and addressing the recommendations will ensure the organization remains resilient against evolving cyber threats.
