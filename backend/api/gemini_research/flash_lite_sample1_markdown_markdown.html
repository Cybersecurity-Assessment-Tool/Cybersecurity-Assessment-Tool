<p><strong>Cybersecurity Readiness Report for Apex Innovations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> October 14, 2025</p>
<p><strong>1. Overview</strong></p>
<p>This report assesses the cybersecurity readiness of Apex Innovations based on provided DNS DIG records, port scan results for the website and firewall, and responses to a security questionnaire. The findings indicate a generally sound cybersecurity posture with strong foundational controls, particularly in user authentication and email security.</p>
<p><strong>2. Organizational Information</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Organization Name:</strong> Apex Innovations</li>
<li><strong>Email Domain:</strong> apexinnovations.com</li>
<li><strong>Website Domain:</strong> www.apexinnovations.com</li>
<li><strong>External IP (Firewall):</strong> 72.21.196.160</li>
<li><strong>Website Hosting IP:</strong> 72.21.196.160</li>
<li><strong>DNS Hosting:</strong> Managed by Apex Innovations' own nameservers (ns1.apexinnovations.com, ns2.apexinnovations.com)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Apex Innovations reports a robust implementation of key security policies and practices. The mandatory use of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical access points significantly strengthens their defense against unauthorized access. The presence of an Acceptable Use Policy and comprehensive security awareness training for all employees further demonstrates a proactive approach to managing human-related security risks.</p>
<p><strong>4. DNS &amp; Email Security</strong></p>
<p><strong>DNS Records:</strong>
*   The DNS records for <code>apexinnovations.com</code> indicate that the organization manages its own nameservers, <code>ns1.apexinnovations.com</code> and <code>ns2.apexinnovations.com</code>.
*   The A record for <code>apexinnovations.com</code> resolves to the external IP address <code>72.21.196.160</code>, which is also identified as the firewall's external IP. This suggests the website might be hosted on or behind this directly accessible IP.
*   MX records point to <code>mx1.apexinnovations.com</code> and <code>mx2.apexinnovations.com</code>, indicating that Apex Innovations handles its own email infrastructure or uses a service that is configured under these hostnames.
*   The SPF record is configured as <code>v=spf1 include:spf.protection.outlook.com -all</code>. This correctly leverages Microsoft 365 (Outlook.com protection) for email authentication, a strong practice for preventing email spoofing.</p>
<p><strong>DMARC Record:</strong>
*   The DMARC record for <code>_dmarc.apexinnovations.com</code> is configured with a <code>p=reject</code> policy and a report-to address: <code>v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:dmarc_reports@apexinnovations.com; fo=1</code>.
*   This is an excellent configuration. The <code>reject</code> policy instructs receiving mail servers to reject any emails claiming to be from <code>apexinnovations.com</code> that do not pass SPF or DKIM checks, providing strong protection against phishing and email spoofing. The <code>fo=1</code> tag indicates that failure reporting should occur if any authentication check (SPF or DKIM) fails.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Apex Innovations has implemented strong email security measures with a correctly configured SPF record pointing to Microsoft 365 and a strict DMARC <code>reject</code> policy. This indicates a high level of readiness to combat email-based threats.</p>
<p><strong>5. Port Scanning Results</strong></p>
<p><strong>Website Hosting (IP: 72.21.196.160)</strong>
*   <strong>Port 80 (HTTP):</strong> Open
*   <strong>Port 443 (HTTPS):</strong> Open
These are standard ports for a publicly accessible website. The presence of both indicates that the website is likely served over HTTP and HTTPS.</p>
<p><strong>Firewall / External IP (IP: 72.21.196.160)</strong>
*   <strong>Port 80 is open</strong>
*   <strong>Port 443 is open</strong>
The port scan of the external IP (which is the same as the website hosting IP) shows that ports 80 and 443 are open. This implies that the firewall is configured to allow traffic to these ports, likely for the web server. It is important to note that no other ports were reported as open.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The external network perimeter appears to be minimally exposed, with only essential ports for web services (HTTP/HTTPS) accessible. This suggests a well-configured firewall that limits the attack surface.</p>

<p><strong>7. Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>While Apex Innovations demonstrates a commendable cybersecurity posture, the following recommendations could further enhance its readiness:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Verify DKIM Implementation:</strong> The DMARC policy recommends checking both SPF and DKIM. Ensure that DKIM is also properly configured and enabled for <code>apexinnovations.com</code> to align with the <code>fo=1</code> setting in the DMARC record and maximize email authentication strength.</li>
<li><strong>Web Server Hardening:</strong> Since ports 80 and 443 are open on the external IP, ensure that the web server software is regularly patched, configured securely (e.g., disabling unnecessary modules, implementing TLS 1.2/1.3), and that any sensitive information is not directly exposed. Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) for additional protection.</li>
<li><strong>Vulnerability Scanning:</strong> Implement regular internal and external vulnerability scanning to proactively identify and remediate potential weaknesses in network infrastructure and web applications.</li>
<li><strong>Incident Response Plan:</strong> Develop and regularly test a comprehensive cybersecurity incident response plan to ensure a swift and effective reaction to any security breaches.</li>
<li><strong>Asset Management:</strong> Maintain a detailed and up-to-date inventory of all hardware and software assets, including web server configurations, to facilitate better security management and incident response.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>8. Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Apex Innovations exhibits a strong cybersecurity readiness, particularly in its implementation of multi-factor authentication, robust email security controls (SPF and DMARC), and comprehensive employee training programs. The limited exposure of its external network perimeter is also a positive indicator. By addressing the minor recommendations, particularly concerning web server hardening and proactive vulnerability management, Apex Innovations can further solidify its security posture and maintain a resilient defense against evolving cyber threats.</p>
