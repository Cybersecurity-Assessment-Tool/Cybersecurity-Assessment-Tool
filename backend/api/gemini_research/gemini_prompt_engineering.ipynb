    "**Cybersecurity Readiness Report for Valier School District**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Date:** July 18, 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "This report evaluates the cybersecurity posture of Valier School District based on technical scans (DNS, DMARC, and port scanning) and a self-reported security questionnaire. The findings reflect a strong commitment to foundational cybersecurity practices across user access, email protection, network exposure, and staff awareness.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Organizational Information**\n",
    "- **Organization Name:** Valier School District\n",
    "- **Email Domain:** valier.k12.mt.us\n",
    "- **Website Domain:** www.valier.k12.mt.us\n",
    "- **External IP (Firewall):** 216.220.16.170\n",
    "- **Website Hosting IPs:** 216.239.32.21, 216.239.34.21, 216.239.36.21, 216.239.38.21\n",
    "- **DNS Hosting:** Managed by University of Montana (umt.edu nameservers)\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Security Questionnaire Review**\n",
    "| Security Control | Status |\n",
    "| :--------------: | :----: |\n",
    "| MFA for Email | Yes |\n",
    "| MFA for Computer Login | Yes |\n",
    "| MFA for Sensitive Systems | Yes |\n",
    "| Acceptable Use Policy | Yes |\n",
    "| New Employee Security Awareness Training | Yes |\n",
    "| Annual All-Employee Security Training | Yes |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary:** The district reports complete implementation of basic cyber hygiene practices, especially user authentication (Multi-Factor Authentication) and routine training. This indicates a proactive and policy-driven approach to risk mitigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. DNS & Email Security**\n",
    "\n",
    "**DNS Records**\n",
    "- DNS is managed by the University of Montana (cudess1.umt.edu, cudess2.umt.edu), suggesting centralized and professionally administered DNS.\n",
    "- A records point to IPs within Google's network (likely Google Sites hosting for web content).\n",
    "**MX Records (Email)**\n",
    "- The district uses Google Workspace (Gmail) for email, as shown by multiple aspmx.l.google.com MX records.\n",
    "- SPF record is correctly configured: v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com include:mg.infinitecampus.org -all\n",
    "    - This helps mitigate spoofing by defining authorized mail senders.\n",
    "**DMARC Record**\n",
    "- A valid DMARC record exists with a **reject** policy: v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:dmarc@valier.k12.mt.us\n",
    "    - This instructs receiving servers to reject unauthenticated mail, providing strong protection against phishing.\n",
    "**Conclusion:** DNS and email protections (SPF, DMARC, and hosting security) are configured correctly and follow best practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Port Scanning Results**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Website Hosting (Google IP: 216.239.32.21)**\n",
    "- **Port 80 (HTTP):** Open\n",
    "- **Port 443 (HTTPS):** Open\n",
    "These are expected for a publicly accessible website and are typical for Google-hosted services.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Firewall / External IP (216.220.16.170)**\n",
    "- **All scanned ports are closed**\n",
    "This is a strong sign of network perimeter hardening and good firewall configuration. No externally exposed services were found on the organization's primary IP.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Risk Assessment & Readiness Summary**\n",
    "| Category | Status | Notes |\n",
    "| :------: | :----: | :---: |\n",
    "| Authentication Security | Strong | MFA is required across key systems |\n",
    "| Email Security | Strong | SPF and DMARC with \"reject\" policy in place |\n",
    "| Network Exposure | Secure | No exposed services on the external firewall IP |\n",
    "| Web Hosting | Secure | Google-hosted; limited attack surface |\n",
    "| Policy & Training | Comprehensive | Acceptable use policies and regular training in place |\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Recommendations**\n",
    "Although the cybersecurity readiness is solid, continuous improvement is essential. We recommend the following:\n",
    "1. **Verify DKIM**: While SPF and DMARC are configured, ensure **DKIM** is also active for all sending domains.\n",
    "2. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Consider regular internal and external vulnerability assessments of network devices and servers.\n",
    "3. **Incident Response Plan**: Document and regularly test a cybersecurity incident reponse and disaster recovery plan.\n",
    "4. **Asset Inventory**: Maintain a regularly updated inventory of hardware/software assets and monitor for unauthorized changes.\n",
    "5. **Third-party Risk**: Evaluate vendors (e.g., Infinite Campus) for their security psture, especially since they're included in SPF.\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "Valier School District demonstrates a strong cybersecurity foundation, particularly in authentication, email protection, staff training, and perimeter security. Continued vigilance and regular audits will help maintain and improve this strong security posture.\n",
    "\n",

Overview**\\n\\nThis report evaluates the cybersecurity posture of Valier School District based on technical scans (DNS, DMARC, and port scanning) and a self-reported security questionnaire. The findings reflect a strong commitment to foundational cybersecurity practices across user access, email protection, network exposure, and staff awareness.\\n\\n**2. Organizational Information**\\n- **Organization Name:** Valier School District\\n- **Email Domain:** valier.k12.mt.us\\n- **Website Domain:** www.valier.k12.mt.us\\n- **External IP (Firewall):** 216.220.16.170\\n- **Website Hosting IPs:** 216.239.32.21, 216.239.34.21, 216.239.36.21, 216.239.38.21\\n- **DNS Hosting:** Managed by University of Montana (umt.edu nameservers)\\n\\n**3. Security Questionnaire Review**\\n| Security Control | Status |\\n| :--------------: | :----: |\\n| MFA for Email | Yes |\\n| MFA for Computer Login | Yes |\\n| MFA for Sensitive Systems | Yes |\\n| Acceptable Use Policy | Yes |\\n| New Employee Security Awareness Training | Yes |\\n| Annual All-Employee Security Training | Yes |\\n\\n**Summary:** The district reports complete implementation of basic cyber hygiene practices, especially user authentication (Multi-Factor Authentication) and routine training. This indicates a proactive and policy-driven approach to risk mitigation.\\n\\n**4. DNS & Email Security**\\n\\n**DNS Records**\\n- DNS is managed by the University of Montana (cudess1.umt.edu, cudess2.umt.edu), suggesting centralized and professionally administered DNS.\\n- A records point to IPs within Google's network (likely Google Sites hosting for web content).\\n**MX Records (Email)**\\n- The district uses Google Workspace (Gmail) for email, as shown by multiple aspmx.l.google.com MX records.\\n- SPF record is correctly configured: v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com include:mg.infinitecampus.org -all\\n\\t- This helps mitigate spoofing by defining authorized mail senders./n**DMARC Record**/n- A valid DMARC record exists with a **reject** policy: v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:dmarc@valier.k12.mt.us\\n\\t- This instructs receiving servers to reject unauthenticated mail, providing strong protection against phishing./n**Conclusion:** DNS and email protections (SPF, DMARC, and hosting security) are configured correctly and follow best practices.\\n\\n**5. Port Scanning Results**\\n\\n**Website Hosting (Google IP: 216.239.32.21)**\\n- **Port 80 (HTTP):** Open\\n- **Port 443 (HTTPS):** Open\\nThese are expected for a publicly accessible website and are typical for Google-hosted services.\\n\\n**Firewall / External IP (216.220.16.170)**\\n- **All scanned ports are closed**\\nThis is a strong sign of network perimeter hardening and good firewall configuration. No externally exposed services were found on the organization's primary IP.\\n\\n**6. Risk Assessment & Readiness Summary**\\n| Category | Status | Notes |\\n| :------: | :----: | :---: |\\n| Authentication Security | Strong | MFA is required across key systems |\\n| Email Security | Strong | SPF and DMARC with \\\"reject\\\" policy in place |\\n| Network Exposure | Secure | No exposed services on the external firewall IP |\\n| Web Hosting | Secure | Google-hosted; limited attack surface |\\n| Policy & Training | Comprehensive | Acceptable use policies and regular training in place |\\n\\n**7. Recommendations**\\nAlthough the cybersecurity readiness is solid, continuous improvement is essential. We recommend the following:\\n1. **Verify DKIM**: While SPF and DMARC are configured, ensure **DKIM** is also active for all sending domains.\\n2. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Consider regular internal and external vulnerability assessments of network devices and servers.\\n3. **Incident Response Plan**: Document and regularly test a cybersecurity incident reponse and disaster recovery plan.\\n4. **Asset Inventory**: Maintain a regularly updated inventory of hardware/software assets and monitor for unauthorized changes.\\n5. **Third-party Risk**: Evaluate vendors (e.g., Infinite Campus) for their security psture, especially since they're included in SPF.\\n\\n**8. Conclusion**\\n\\nValier School District demonstrates a strong cybersecurity foundation, particularly in authentication, email protection, staff training, and perimeter security. Continued vigilance and regular audits will help maintain and improve this strong security posture.\\n\\n**Prepared by:**\\n\\nCybersecurity Assessment Team\\n\\n**Date:** July 18, 2025\"\n",

      "\n",
      "1.  **Immediate Network Remediation:**\n",
      "    *   **Close Exposed Ports:** Immediately close ports 21 (FTP), 22 (SSH), 110 (POP3), and especially 3389 (RDP) on your external firewall.\n",
      "    *   **Implement VPN:** If remote access is required for these services, it must be secured behind a Virtual Private Network (VPN) that requires MFA.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**\n",
      "    *   Immediately enable MFA for all user accounts, prioritizing email, remote access (VPN), and administrative accounts.\n",
      "    *   Develop a plan to roll out MFA for all computer logins.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Strengthen Email Security:**\n",
      "    *   **Implement DMARC:** Create and publish a DMARC record, starting with a monitoring policy (`p=none`) and progressing quickly to a quarantine or reject policy (`p=reject`).\n",
      "    *   **Strengthen SPF:** Change the SPF record from `~all` (softfail) to `-all` (hardfail) to instruct receiving servers to reject mail from unauthorized sources.\n",
      "    *   **Implement DKIM:** Ensure DKIM is configured for your email provider to digitally sign outgoing messages.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Develop Foundational Policies and Training:**\n",
      "    *   **Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):** Create and implement an AUP for all employees.\n",
      "    *   **Security Awareness Training:** Immediately enroll all employees in a security awareness training program, with mandatory annual refreshers.\n",
      "\n",
      "**8. Conclusion**\n",
      "\n",
      "G.A.S. Inc. currently exhibits a very low level of cybersecurity readiness. The combination of an exposed network perimeter, weak authentication controls, inadequate email security, and a lack of security policies places the organization at an extremely high risk of a significant cyberattack. The recommendations outlined in this report should be treated as urgent priorities to mitigate these immediate threats.\n"

The findings indicate a significantly low level of cybersecurity readiness across multiple critical areas, presenting substantial risks to the organization's data, systems, and operations. Urgent action is required to address these vulnerabilities.\n",

      "| Security Control | Status |\n",
      "| :-------------------------------: | :----: |\n",
      "| MFA for Email | No |\n",

      "| New Employee Security Awareness Training | No |\n",
      "| Annual All-Employee Security Training | No |\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary:** The organization's self-assessment reveals a severe lack of fundamental cybersecurity controls. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is largely absent, being only applied to sensitive data systems, leaving email and computer logins vulnerable. Furthermore, there is no employee acceptable use policy and no security awareness training for new or existing employees. This indicates a significant gap in security culture and foundational policy enforcement.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. DNS & Email Security**\n",
      "\n",
      "**DNS Records**\n",
      "-   DNS is managed internally by G.A.S. Inc. (dns1.gasinc.net, dns2.gasinc.net). While possible, this requires robust internal management and redundancy to ensure reliability and security.\n",
      "-   The A record for gasinc.net points to 104.28.1.189, indicating that the website is hosted on the same external IP as the primary network perimeter.\n",
      "\n",
      "**MX Records (Email)**\n",
      "-   G.A.S. Inc. utilizes Mailhostbox.com for email services, as shown by the MX records: `mx.mailhostbox.com` and `mx2.mailhostbox.com`.\n",
      "-   **SPF Record:** The SPF record is configured as `v=spf1 include:spf.mailhostbox.com ~all`.\n",
      "    -   The `~all` (softfail) policy indicates that unauthenticated emails from the domain should be treated with suspicion but not necessarily rejected. While better than no SPF, it is not as strong as a `-all` (fail) policy in preventing spoofing.\n",
      "\n",
      "**DMARC Record**\n",
      "-   A DMARC record for `_dmarc.gasinc.net` does not exist (NXDOMAIN).\n",
      "    -   **Critical Finding:** The absence of a DMARC record means there is no policy to guide receiving mail servers on how to handle emails that fail SPF or DKIM authentication. This leaves the `gasinc.net` domain highly vulnerable to email spoofing, phishing, and Business Email Compromise (BEC) attacks, as malicious actors can easily send emails purporting to be from G.A.S. Inc. without detection.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion:** G.A.S. Inc.'s email security posture is critically weak due to the complete lack of a DMARC policy and a permissive SPF policy. This exposes the organization to significant email-based threats.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Port Scanning Results**\n",
      "\n",
      "The port scans against the external IP 104.28.1.189 (which hosts both the website and serves as the external firewall) reveal an alarmingly wide-open network perimeter.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Open Ports on External IP (104.28.1.189)**\n",
      "-   **Port 21 (FTP):** Open - File Transfer Protocol is often insecure, transmitting credentials in plaintext, and can be exploited for unauthorized access or file manipulation.\n",
      "-   **Port 22 (SSH):** Open - Secure Shell access should ideally be restricted to trusted IPs or via VPN. Direct exposure to the internet is a common target for brute-force attacks.\n",
      "-   **Port 25 (SMTP):** Open - While email is hosted by Mailhostbox, an open SMTP port on the external IP could indicate an internal mail server, relay, or an unnecessary exposure that can be abused for spam or other attacks.\n",
      "-   **Port 80 (HTTP):** Open - Standard for web traffic.\n",
      "-   **Port 110 (POP3):** Open - Post Office Protocol version 3 is an insecure, unencrypted email retrieval protocol. Its external exposure is a severe vulnerability for credential theft. Modern email clients should use secure POP3S (Port 995) or IMAPS (Port 993).\n",
      "-   **Port 443 (HTTPS):** Open - Standard for secure web traffic.\n",
      "-   **Port 3389 (RDP):** Open - Remote Desktop Protocol is a *critical* security risk when exposed directly to the internet. RDP is a frequent target for brute-force attacks and exploitation, which can lead to full system compromise.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion:** The exposure of multiple high-risk services (FTP, SSH, POP3, RDP, potentially SMTP) directly to the internet on the organization's primary external IP creates an extremely broad and vulnerable attack surface. This configuration dramatically increases the likelihood of unauthorized access, data breaches, and system compromise.\n",

      "\n",
      "1.  **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Broadly:**\n",
      "    *   **Urgent:** Mandate MFA for all email accounts.\n",
      "    *   **Urgent:** Mandate MFA for all computer logins, especially for users with administrative privileges.\n",
      "2.  **Enhance Email Security:**\n",
      "    *   **Critical:** Implement a DMARC record for `gasinc.net`. Start with a `p=quarantine` policy and move towards `p=reject` after monitoring DMARC reports to ensure legitimate emails are not affected.\n",
      "    *   **Stronger SPF:** Consider changing the SPF policy from `~all` to `-all` once DMARC is stable and all legitimate email senders are accounted for.\n",
      "    *   **Verify DKIM:** Ensure DKIM is properly configured for Mailhostbox.com and any other services sending email on behalf of `gasinc.net`.\n",
      "3.  **Reduce Network Exposure (Firewall Hardening):**\n",
      "    *   **Critical:** Immediately close or restrict access to **Port 3389 (RDP)**. Remote access should only be allowed through a securely configured Virtual Private Network (VPN) with MFA.\n",
      "    *   **Critical:** Close **Port 110 (POP3)**. Use secure email retrieval protocols like IMAPS (Port 993) or POP3S (Port 995) if local client access is required, or encourage webmail via HTTPS.\n",
      "    *   **Urgent:** Close **Port 21 (FTP)**. Migrate to secure file transfer protocols like SFTP or FTPS, or utilize secure cloud-based file sharing solutions.\n",
      "    *   **Review Port 22 (SSH):** If SSH access is necessary, restrict it to known source IP addresses, disable password authentication in favor of key-based authentication, change the default port, and ensure strong logging and monitoring. Ideally, SSH access should also be behind a VPN.\n",
      "    *   **Review Port 25 (SMTP):** As email is handled by Mailhostbox, determine if Port 25 on the external IP is truly necessary. If not, close it. If it is for an internal server, ensure it is configured securely and only relays authorized mail.\n",
      "4.  **Establish and Enforce Security Policies:**\n",
      "    *   Develop and implement an **Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)** outlining expectations for secure technology usage.\n",
      "5.  **Implement Security Awareness Training:**\n",
      "    *   Develop and deliver **mandatory security awareness training** for all new employees upon hire.\n",
      "    *   Conduct **annual mandatory security awareness training** for all employees, covering topics like phishing, malware, password hygiene, and data handling.\n",
      "6.  **Regular Vulnerability Management:**\n",
      "    *   Conduct regular internal and external vulnerability assessments and penetration testing to identify and remediate weaknesses proactively.\n",
      "7.  **Develop an Incident Response Plan:**\n",
      "    *   Create a documented and tested incident response plan to effectively handle security breaches, minimize damage, and ensure business continuity.\n",

      "\n",
      "G.A.S. Inc. has significant cybersecurity vulnerabilities that require immediate attention. The following recommendations are prioritized to improve the organization's readiness:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**\n",
      "    *   **High Priority:** Enforce MFA for all email accounts and computer logins. This is the single most effective control against compromised credentials.\n",
      "2.  **Harden Firewall and Network Exposure:**\n",
      "    *   **High Priority:** Close all unnecessary open ports on the external firewall (Ports 21, 22, 25, 110, 3389).\n",
      "    *   Restrict access to only essential services and use strong access controls (e.g., VPN for SSH/RDP access, specific IP whitelisting if possible).\n",
      "    *   If FTP is still required, migrate to SFTP or FTPS and ensure strong authentication.\n",
      "    *   Consider a managed firewall service if internal expertise is limited.\n",
      "3.  **Implement DMARC and DKIM:**\n",
      "    *   **High Priority:** Publish a DMARC record for `gasinc.net` with a clear policy (e.g., `p=reject` or `p=quarantine`) and a reporting address.\n",
      "    *   Ensure DKIM is configured and active for all outgoing email.\n",
      "4.  **Develop and Enforce an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):**\n",
      "    *   **High Priority:** Create a clear policy outlining acceptable and unacceptable use of company IT resources, including internet, email, and devices. Ensure employees acknowledge and adhere to it.\n",
      "5.  **Conduct Regular Security Awareness Training:**\n",
      "    *   **High Priority:** Implement a comprehensive security awareness training program for all employees, covering topics like phishing, password security, social engineering, and data handling. This training should be mandatory for new hires and conducted annually for all staff.\n",
      "6.  **Review and Secure Email Services:**\n",
      "    *   While using `mailhostbox.com` is noted, ensure their security practices are robust and that all email security features (like encryption options) are utilized.\n",
      "7.  **Regular Vulnerability Scanning and Patch Management:**\n",
      "    *   Implement a schedule for regular internal and external vulnerability scans to identify and address weaknesses.\n",
      "    *   Maintain a robust patch management process for all systems and applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "**8. Conclusion**\n",
      "\n",
      "G.A.S. Inc. currently exhibits a low level of cybersecurity readiness. The lack of basic security controls like MFA for email and logins, a proper acceptable use policy, and employee training creates a highly vulnerable environment. The exposed network services on the external IP further exacerbate these risks. Addressing the recommendations outlined above, particularly the implementation of MFA, network hardening, and employee training, is critical to mitigating immediate threats and establishing a more secure operational foundation. Continuous monitoring and periodic security assessments will be necessary to maintain an improved security posture.\n",

      " 1.  Overview  \n",
      "This  report  evaluates  the  cybersecurity  posture  of  Valier  School  District  based  on  technical  scans  (DNS,  DMARC,  and  port  scanning)  and  a  self-reported  security  questionnaire.  The  findings  reflect  a  strong  commitment  to  foundational  cybersecurity  practices  across  user  access,  email  protection,  network  exposure,  and  staff  awareness.  \n",
      " 2.  Organizational  Information  \n",
      "●  Organization  Name:  Valier  School  District   ●  Email  Domain:  valier.k12.mt.us   ●  Website  Domain: www.valier.k12.mt.us   ●  External  IP  (Firewall):  216.220.16.170   ●  Website  Hosting  IPs:  216.239.32.21,  216.239.34.21,  216.239.36.21,  216.239.38.21   ●  DNS  Hosting:  Managed  by  University  of  Montana  (umt.edu  nameservers)  \n",
      " 3.  Security  Questionnaire  Review  Security  Control  Status  \n",
      "MFA  for  Email  ✅  Yes  \n",
      "MFA  for  Computer  Login  ✅  Yes  \n",
      "MFA  for  Sensitive  Systems  ✅  Yes  \n",
      "Acceptable  Use  Policy  ✅  Yes  \n",
      "New  Employee  Security  Awareness  Training  ✅  Yes  \n",
      "Annual  All-Employee  Security  Training  ✅  Yes  \n",
      "Summary:  The  district  reports  complete  implementation  of  basic  cyber  hygiene  practices,  especially  \n",
      "user  authentication  (Multi-Factor  Authentication)  and  routine  training.  This  indicates  a  proactive  and  policy-driven  approach  to  risk  mitigation.  \n",
      " 4.  DNS  &  Email  Security  \n",
      "DNS  Records  \n",
      "●  DNS  is  managed  by  the  University  of  Montana  (cudess1.umt.edu,  cudess2.umt.edu),  suggesting  centralized  and  professionally  administered  DNS.   ●  A  records  point  to  IPs  within  Google's  network  (likely  Google  Sites  hosting  for  web  content).   \n",
      "MX  Records  (Email)  \n",
      "●  The  district  uses  Google  Workspace  (Gmail)  for  email,  as  shown  by  multiple  aspmx.l.google.com MX  records.   ●  SPF  record  is  correctly  configured:   v=spf1  include:_spf.google.com  include:mg.infinitecampus.org  -all   This  helps  mitigate  spoofing  by  defining  authorized  mail  senders.   \n",
      "DMARC  Record  \n",
      "●  A  valid  DMARC  record  exists  with  a  reject  policy:   v=DMARC1;  p=reject;  rua=mailto:dmarc@valier.k12.mt.us   This  instructs  receiving  servers  to  reject  unauthenticated  mail,  providing  strong  protection  against  phishing.  \n",
      "Conclusion:  DNS  and  email  protections  (SPF,  DMARC,  and  hosting  security)  are  configured  correctly  and  follow  best  practices.  \n",
      " \n",
      "5.  Port  Scanning  Results  \n",
      "Website  Hosting  (Google  IP:  216.239.32.21)  \n",
      "●  Port  80  (HTTP):  Open   ●  Port  443  (HTTPS):  Open   These  are  expected  for  a  publicly  accessible  website  and  are  typical  for  Google-hosted  services.  \n",
      "Firewall  /  External  IP  (216.220.16.170)  \n",
      "●  All  scanned  ports  are  closed   This  is  a  strong  sign  of  network  perimeter  hardening  and  good  firewall  configuration.  No  externally  exposed  services  were  found  on  the  organization’s  primary  IP.  \n",
      " \n",
      "6.  Risk  Assessment  &  Readiness  Summary  Category  Status  Notes  \n",
      "Authentication  Security  ✅  Strong  MFA  is  required  across  key  systems  \n",
      "Email  Security  ✅  Strong  SPF  and  DMARC  with  “reject”  policy  in  place  \n",
      "Network  Exposure  ✅  Secure  No  exposed  services  on  the  external  firewall  IP  \n",
      "Web  Hosting  ✅  Secure  Google-hosted;  limited  attack  surface  \n",
      "Policy  &  Training  ✅  Comprehensive  Acceptable  use  policies  and  regular  training  in  place  \n",
      " \n",
      "7.  Recommendations  \n",
      "Although  the  cybersecurity  readiness  is  solid,  continuous  improvement  is  essential.  We  recommend  the  following:  \n",
      "1.  Verify  DKIM :  While  SPF  and  DMARC  are  configured,  ensure  DKIM  is  also  active  for  all  sending  domains.   2.  Vulnerability  Scanning :  Consider  regular  internal  and  external  vulnerability  assessments  of  network  devices  and  servers.   3.  Incident  Response  Plan :  Document  and  regularly  test  a  cybersecurity  incident  response  and  disaster  recovery  plan.   4.  Asset  Inventory :  Maintain  a  regularly  updated  inventory  of  hardware/software  assets  and  monitor  for  unauthorized  changes.   5.  Third-party  Risk :  Evaluate  vendors  (e.g.,  Infinite  Campus)  for  their  security  posture,  especially  since  they're  included  in  SPF.  \n",
      " \n",
      "8.  Conclusion  \n",
      "Valier  School  District  demonstrates  a  strong  cybersecurity  foundation,  particularly  in  authentication,  email  protection,  staff  training,  and  perimeter  security.  Continued  vigilance  and  regular  audits  will  help  maintain  and  improve  this  strong  security  posture.  \n",

The findings indicate a strong commitment to identity management, employee awareness, and email security. However, the network architecture, which exposes web services on the primary external IP address, presents a notable area for improvement and a potential risk to the organization.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Organizational Information**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Organization Name:** Apex Innovations\n",
      "*   **Email Domain:** apexinnovations.com\n",
      "*   **Website Domain:** www.apexinnovations.com\n",
      "*   **External / Website IP:** 72.21.196.160 (Note: The primary external IP and the web server IP are the same)\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Security Questionnaire Review**\n",
      "\n",
      "| Security Control | Status |\n",
      "| :--- | :---: |\n",

      "| MFA for Sensitive Systems | ✅ Yes |\n",
      "| Acceptable Use Policy | ✅ Yes |\n",
      "| New Employee Security Awareness Training | ✅ Yes |\n",
      "| Annual All-Employee Security Training | ✅ Yes |\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary:** Apex Innovations reports a strong internal security culture. The mandatory use of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all key access points significantly reduces the risk of credential-based attacks. This is complemented by a solid foundation of employee policies and regular security awareness training.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. DNS & Email Security**\n",
      "\n",
      "**DNS Records**\n",
      "*   DNS is managed on self-hosted nameservers (`ns1.apexinnovations.com`, `ns2.apexinnovations.com`), indicating direct control over their DNS infrastructure.\n",
      "\n",
      "**MX Records (Email)**\n",
      "*   The organization uses Microsoft 365 for its email services, as indicated by the SPF record pointing to `spf.protection.outlook.com`.\n",
      "*   The SPF record is correctly configured with a `-all` (hard fail) mechanism, which helps prevent unauthorized servers from sending email on behalf of their domain:\n",
      "    `v=spf1 include:spf.protection.outlook.com -all`\n",
      "\n",
      "**DMARC Record**\n",
      "*   A strong DMARC policy is in place, instructing receiving mail servers to **reject** emails that fail authentication checks. This provides excellent protection against direct domain spoofing and phishing attacks.\n",
      "    `v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:dmarc_reports@apexinnovations.com; fo=1`\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion:** The organization's email security configuration is robust and adheres to modern best practices. The combination of SPF and a DMARC \"reject\" policy is a significant strength.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Port Scanning Results**\n",
      "\n",
      "**External Firewall / Website IP (72.21.196.160)**\n",
      "*   **Port 80 (HTTP): Open**\n",
      "*   **Port 443 (HTTPS): Open**\n",
      "\n",
      "The port scan reveals that the primary external IP address for the organization is also hosting the public-facing website. While these ports are necessary for web traffic, exposing them directly on the main corporate firewall IP increases the network's attack surface. Any vulnerability in the web server, its applications, or its configuration could potentially provide a pivot point into the internal network.\n",
      "\n",
      "**6. Risk Assessment & Readiness Summary**\n",
      "\n",
      "| Category | Status | Notes |\n",
      "| :--- | :---: | :--- |\n",
      "| Authentication Security | ✅ Strong | Comprehensive MFA implementation across all critical systems. |\n",
      "| Email Security | ✅ Strong | SPF and DMARC with a \"reject\" policy are correctly configured. |\n",
      "| Network Exposure | ⚠️ Moderate | The public website is exposed on the primary external firewall IP, creating a direct attack vector that should be isolated. |\n",
      "| Web Hosting | ⚠️ Moderate | Hosting the website on the primary network perimeter places the burden of security (patching, hardening) entirely on the organization. |\n",
      "| Policy & Training | ✅ Comprehensive | All foundational policies and training programs are in place. |\n",
      "\n",
      "**7. Recommendations**\n",
      "\n",
      "While Apex Innovations has many strong security controls, the following recommendations are made to address the identified risks and further mature its cybersecurity posture:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Network Segmentation:** The highest priority should be to isolate the web server from the internal corporate network. This can be achieved by:\n",
      "    *   Placing the web server in a segregated network zone (a DMZ).\n",
      "    *   Migrating the website to a reputable third-party cloud hosting provider.\n",
      "    This will ensure that a compromise of the web server does not lead to an immediate compromise of internal systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Web Application Security:** Given its direct exposure, the web server requires heightened security. Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect against common web-based attacks and conduct regular vulnerability scans of the web application and server.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Verify DKIM Implementation:** While SPF and DMARC are in place, ensure that DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) is also configured for Microsoft 365 to complete the trifecta of email authentication standards.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Develop an Incident Response Plan:** Formalize, document, and test an incident response plan to ensure the organization can respond effectively and efficiently in the event of a security breach.\n",
      "\n",
      "**8. Conclusion**\n",
      "\n",
      "Apex Innovations demonstrates a very strong cybersecurity foundation in terms of policy, user authentication, and email security. These proactive measures significantly reduce risk from phishing and credential theft. The primary area of concern is the network architecture, where the public-facing website is co-located with the main network perimeter. By implementing the recommendation to segment the web server, Apex Innovations can substantially reduce its attack surface and elevate its overall security posture from strong to excellent.\n"

      "**4. DNS & Email Security**\n",
      "\n",
      "**DNS Records:**\n",
      "*   The DNS records for `apexinnovations.com` show both NS (Name Server) records pointing to `ns1.apexinnovations.com` and `ns2.apexinnovations.com`, suggesting the organization manages its own DNS infrastructure.\n",
      "*   An A record points to `72.21.196.160`, which is consistent with the external IP address scanned and identified as the firewall.\n",
      "*   MX records indicate that email is handled by Microsoft 365 (`spf.protection.outlook.com`).\n",
      "\n",
      "**SPF Record:**\n",
      "*   The SPF record is correctly configured as: `v=spf1 include:spf.protection.outlook.com -all`. This record properly authorizes Microsoft 365 servers to send email on behalf of `apexinnovations.com`, helping to prevent email spoofing.\n",
      "\n",
      "**DMARC Record:**\n",
      "*   A DMARC record is present with a `reject` policy: `v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:dmarc_reports@apexinnovations.com; fo=1`.\n",
      "    *   The `p=reject` policy is strong, instructing receiving mail servers to reject emails that fail DMARC authentication.\n",
      "    *   The `rua` tag indicates that aggregate reports will be sent to `dmarc_reports@apexinnovations.com`, which is crucial for monitoring email authentication and identifying potential spoofing attempts.\n",
      "    *   The `fo=1` flag requests failure reporting for all checking, providing detailed information on authentication failures.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion:** Apex Innovations has implemented robust email security measures through correctly configured SPF and DMARC records with a strict reject policy. The active use of DMARC reporting is a key indicator of diligent security monitoring.\n",

      "Apex Innovations has demonstrated a strong cybersecurity posture. To further enhance readiness, the following recommendations are made:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Verify DKIM:** While SPF and DMARC are in place, ensure that DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) signing is also implemented and configured correctly for outgoing emails. DKIM adds another layer of email authentication and strengthens protection against spoofing.\n",
      "2.  **Regular Vulnerability Scanning:** Conduct regular, scheduled vulnerability scans (both internal and external) of the network infrastructure and web servers. This proactive measure helps identify and address potential weaknesses before they can be exploited.\n",
      "3.  **Incident Response Plan Review:** Ensure that a comprehensive incident response plan is documented, regularly reviewed, and tested. This plan should outline procedures for responding to various security incidents, including data breaches and system compromise.\n",
      "4.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Given that the website is accessible via ports 80 and 443, consider implementing a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to provide an additional layer of protection against common web-based attacks such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).\n",
      "5.  **Log Monitoring and Analysis:** Implement robust log monitoring and analysis solutions for critical systems and network devices. This will aid in the early detection of suspicious activities and facilitate faster incident response.\n",
      "\n",
      "**8. Conclusion**\n",
      "\n",
      "Apex Innovations exhibits a high level of cybersecurity readiness. The organization has successfully implemented strong controls around user authentication, email security, and network perimeter defense. The commitment to employee training and policy enforcement further solidifies its security posture. By considering the additional recommendations, Apex Innovations can continue to mature its cybersecurity program and maintain a robust defense against evolving threats.\n",

      "**1. Overview**\n",
      "This report evaluates the cybersecurity posture of G.A.S. Inc. based on a security questionnaire and external technical scans. The findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in network security, email configuration, user authentication, and organizational policy. The organization currently has a very weak security posture and is at high risk of a cyberattack, including ransomware, data breach, and business email compromise. Immediate and decisive action is required to mitigate these risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Organizational Information**\n",
      "● **Organization Name:** G.A.S. Inc.\n",
      "● **Email Domain:** gasinc.net\n",

      "| Security Control | Status |\n",
      "| :--- | :--- |\n",
      "| MFA for Email | ❌ **No** |\n",
      "| MFA for Computer Login | ❌ **No** |\n",
      "| MFA for Sensitive Systems | ✅ Yes |\n",
      "| Acceptable Use Policy | ❌ **No** |\n",
      "| New Employee Security Awareness Training | ❌ **No** |\n",
      "| Annual All-Employee Security Training | ❌ **No** |\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary:** The questionnaire reveals a significant lack of foundational security controls. The absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and computer access exposes the organization to account takeovers from simple password compromises. The lack of security policies and employee training indicates a low level of security maturity, making staff highly susceptible to social engineering and phishing attacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. DNS & Email Security**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **SPF Record:** An SPF record exists (`v=spf1 include:spf.mailhostbox.com ~all`). However, it uses a soft-fail (`~all`) policy, which only marks unauthorized emails as suspicious rather than blocking them. This provides weak protection against email spoofing.\n",
      "*   **DMARC Record:** A DMARC record for `_dmarc.gasinc.net` is **missing** (`rcode NXDOMAIN`). Without DMARC, the organization has no ability to instruct receiving email servers on how to handle fraudulent emails sent on its behalf and has no visibility into spoofing campaigns targeting its domain.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion:** Email security is poor. The combination of a weak SPF policy and the complete absence of DMARC leaves G.A.S. Inc. highly vulnerable to phishing, business email compromise, and brand impersonation attacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Port Scanning Results**\n",
      "A port scan of the external IP address (104.28.1.189) revealed multiple high-risk services exposed directly to the internet.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Port 21 (FTP): Open** - Insecure, unencrypted protocol.\n",
      "*   **Port 22 (SSH): Open** - Potential access point for attackers.\n",

      "The following actions should be taken to address the identified vulnerabilities, prioritized by risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Immediate (Critical Priority):**\n",
      "1.  **Close Port 3389 (RDP):** Immediately place the RDP service behind a Virtual Private Network (VPN) with MFA. Do not leave it exposed to the public internet.\n",
      "2.  **Close Insecure Ports:** Close ports 21 (FTP) and 110 (POP3) on the firewall. Use secure, encrypted alternatives like SFTP or IMAPS/POP3S, accessible only via VPN.\n",
      "3.  **Restrict Access to Other Ports:** Review the business need for public access to Port 22 (SSH) and Port 25 (SMTP). If required, restrict access to a whitelist of known, trusted IP addresses.\n",
      "\n",
      "**High Priority:**\n",
      "4.  **Enforce MFA:** Immediately implement and require MFA for all user accounts, especially for email access (e.g., Office 365, Google Workspace) and computer logins.\n",
      "5.  **Implement DMARC:** Create a DMARC record with a starting policy of `p=none` to begin monitoring, with the goal of moving to `p=quarantine` and ultimately `p=reject`.\n",
      "6.  **Strengthen SPF:** Change the SPF record from a soft-fail (`~all`) to a hard-fail (`-all`) to instruct receiving servers to reject mail from unauthorized sources.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Medium Priority:**\n",
      "7.  **Develop Policies:** Establish and distribute a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy.\n",
      "8.  **Implement Security Training:** Institute a mandatory security awareness training program for all new hires and conduct annual refresher training for all employees.\n",
      "\n",
      "**8. Conclusion**\n",
      "G.A.S. Inc. is currently operating with a critically low level of cybersecurity readiness. The combination of an insecure network perimeter, weak email protections, and a lack of fundamental user security controls and policies places the organization at an imminent risk of a significant security breach. The recommendations outlined in this report, particularly the immediate closure of exposed RDP and other insecure ports, must be addressed urgently to protect the organization's data, finances, and reputation.\n",

      "### 7. Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the critical findings, G.A.S. Inc. must take immediate and decisive action to improve its cybersecurity posture.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Immediate & Critical Actions (Within 24-72 hours):**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Close Unnecessary Ports:** Immediately close ports 21 (FTP), 110 (POP3), and 3389 (RDP) on `104.28.1.189`. If these services are absolutely necessary:\n",
      "    *   **RDP (3389):** Implement a VPN for all remote access or restrict access to specific, trusted source IP addresses. Never expose RDP directly to the internet.\n",
      "    *   **FTP (21) & POP3 (110):** Disable these insecure protocols. Migrate to SFTP/SCP (port 22 with strong SSH configuration), or use secure email protocols like IMAPS (993) or POP3S (995) *only if necessary* and with strong authentication.\n",
      "    *   **SSH (22):** If SSH is required, implement key-based authentication, disable password authentication, restrict access to specific IP addresses, change the default port, and use strong, unique passphrases.\n",
      "    *   **SMTP (25):** Ensure port 25 is only open to necessary Mailhostbox servers or an internal mail relay.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Implement DMARC:** Configure a DMARC record for `gasinc.net` with at least a `p=quarantine` policy, if not `p=reject`, to protect against email spoofing. Monitor DMARC reports regularly.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Strengthen SPF:** Change the SPF record from `~all` (softfail) to `-all` (hardfail) to ensure that emails from unauthorized senders are rejected.\n",
      "\n",
      "**High-Priority Actions (Within 1-2 months):**\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Implement MFA Broadly:**\n",
      "    *   Require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all email accounts.\n",
      "    *   Require MFA for all employee computer logins.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Develop & Enforce Security Policies:**\n",
      "    *   Create and disseminate an employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP).\n",
      "    *   Develop policies for remote access, password management, and data handling.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.  **Conduct Security Awareness Training:**\n",
      "    *   Implement mandatory security awareness training for all new employees.\n",
      "    *   Establish an annual mandatory security awareness training program for all existing employees, covering topics like phishing, social engineering, password hygiene, and incident reporting.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Ongoing Improvements:**\n",
      "\n",
      "7.  **Vulnerability Management:** Implement a regular schedule for internal and external vulnerability scans and penetration testing.\n",
      "8.  **Incident Response Plan:** Develop and regularly test a comprehensive cybersecurity incident response plan and disaster recovery procedures.\n",
      "9.  **DNS Security Review:** Review the security posture of the self-managed DNS nameservers. Consider moving to a managed DNS service for increased resilience and security if internal resources are limited.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 8. Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "G.A.S. Inc. currently exhibits a **low to critical cybersecurity readiness**. The direct exposure of highly vulnerable services on its external IP, coupled with the absence of fundamental email authentication (DMARC) and critical organizational security policies and training, places the organization at extreme risk of cyberattacks, data breaches, and business disruption.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Urgent and comprehensive remediation** of the identified vulnerabilities and implementation of the recommended security controls are imperative to protect G.A.S. Inc.'s assets, data, and reputation.\n",

      "\n",
      "This report assesses the cybersecurity readiness of G.A.S. Inc. based on the provided DNS, port scan results, and answers to a security questionnaire. The findings indicate several critical areas of vulnerability and a lack of fundamental security controls, suggesting a low level of cybersecurity readiness.\n",

      "| MFA to log into computers?                 | No     | Critical vulnerability. Without MFA for computer logins, any compromised credentials can lead to full system access.                  |\n",
      "| MFA to access sensitive data systems?      | Yes    | Positive control, but its effectiveness is diminished by the lack of MFA on email and general computer logins.                      |\n",
      "| Employee acceptable use policy?            | No     | Significant gap. An AUP is foundational for setting user expectations and defining responsible technology use.                      |\n",
      "| Security awareness training for new employees? | No     | Critical gap. New employees are often prime targets for social engineering. Lack of training leaves them unprepared.              |\n",
      "| Security awareness training for all employees annually? | No     | Critical gap. Cybersecurity threats evolve constantly. Regular training is essential to keep employees informed and vigilant. |\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary:** G.A.S. Inc. demonstrates a significant lack of fundamental cybersecurity controls. The absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for email and general computer logins, coupled with no acceptable use policy and no security awareness training, creates a highly vulnerable environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. DNS & Email Security\n",
      "\n",
      "**DNS Records:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   The `gasinc.net` domain has A records pointing to `104.28.1.189`.\n",
      "*   MX records are configured for `gasinc.net`, directing mail to `mx.mailhostbox.com` and `mx2.mailhostbox.com`. This indicates an external email hosting provider is being used.\n",
      "*   A TXT record for SPF is present: `\"v=spf1 include:spf.mailhostbox.com ~all\"`. This is a positive step in helping to prevent email spoofing.\n",
      "\n",
      "**DMARC Record:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   The `_dmarc.gasinc.net` query returned an `NXDOMAIN` (Non-Existent Domain) error. This means no DMARC record is configured.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion:** While SPF is present, the lack of a DMARC record is a significant oversight. DMARC, when implemented with SPF and DKIM (which is not confirmed here but is a common pairing), provides a robust defense against email spoofing and phishing. The absence of a DMARC record leaves the organization exposed to these threats.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. Port Scanning Results\n",
      "\n",
      "**Website Hosting (104.28.1.189):**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Port 80 (HTTP): Open\n",
      "*   Port 443 (HTTPS): Open\n",

      "*   Port 80 (HTTP): Open\n",
      "*   Port 110 (POP3): Open\n",
      "*   Port 443 (HTTPS): Open\n",
      "*   Port 3389 (RDP): Open\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion:** The firewall scan reveals a disturbingly high number of open ports exposed to the internet. This includes ports commonly associated with file transfer (FTP), remote access (SSH, RDP), email services (SMTP, POP3), and web services (HTTP, HTTPS). Each open port represents a potential attack vector. The exposure of port 3389 (RDP) is particularly concerning, as it is a frequent target for brute-force attacks and exploitation if not secured with strong credentials and MFA.\n",

      "\n",
      "G.A.S. Inc. is at a **low level of cybersecurity readiness** and requires immediate and significant improvements. The following recommendations are critical:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Everywhere:**\n",
      "    *   Immediately enforce MFA for all email accounts.\n",
      "    *   Enforce MFA for all user logins to computers and company devices.\n",
      "    *   Ensure strong, unique passwords are also enforced.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Develop and Enforce an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):**\n",
      "    *   Create a comprehensive AUP that clearly outlines acceptable and prohibited uses of company IT resources.\n",
      "    *   Ensure all employees read, understand, and sign the AUP.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Establish a Robust Security Awareness Training Program:**\n",
      "    *   Implement mandatory security awareness training for all new employees.\n",
      "    *   Conduct annual (at a minimum) security awareness training for all employees. This training should cover phishing, social engineering, password security, and safe browsing habits.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Harden the Network Perimeter:**\n",
      "    *   **Review and restrict open ports:** Critically evaluate every open port on the external firewall. Close any ports that are not absolutely necessary for business operations.\n",
      "    *   **Secure RDP:** If RDP access is required, it must be secured with MFA, strong passwords, and ideally accessed via a VPN rather than directly exposed to the internet. Consider disabling RDP from the public internet entirely.\n",
      "    *   **Implement Network Segmentation:** If possible, segment the network to limit the blast radius of any potential breach.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Configure DMARC:**\n",
      "    *   Implement a DMARC record for `gasinc.net`. Start with a monitoring mode (`p=none`) to analyze reports, then move to quarantine (`p=quarantine`) or reject (`p=reject`) as confidence grows.\n",
      "    *   Ensure DKIM is also configured and aligned with SPF and DMARC for comprehensive email authentication.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.  **Regular Vulnerability Scanning and Penetration Testing:**\n",
      "    *   Conduct regular external and internal vulnerability scans to identify weaknesses.\n",
      "    *   Consider periodic penetration testing to simulate real-world attacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "7.  **Review Email Hosting Security:**\n",
      "    *   While using an external provider is common, ensure G.A.S. Inc. understands the security responsibilities of their chosen email hosting provider (mailhostbox.com).\n",
      "\n",
      "### 8. Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "G.A.S. Inc. is currently operating with significant cybersecurity risks due to the absence of fundamental security controls. The open ports on the firewall and the lack of MFA and employee training are critical vulnerabilities that expose the organization to a high risk of data breaches, ransomware, and other cyberattacks. Immediate remediation of the recommended actions is essential to improve the organization's cybersecurity posture and protect its assets and reputation.\n"

      "\"Overall Readiness: G.A.S. Inc. has a low cybersecurity readiness. There are critical vulnerabilities across multiple domains, from user authentication and email security to network perimeter protection and employee awareness. The organization is at a very high risk of cyberattack and data breach.\"\n",
      "],\n",
      "\"Recommendations\": [\n",
      "\"1. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Immediately enforce MFA for all email access and computer logins to prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are stolen.\",\n",
      "\"2. Secure Network Perimeter: Review and close all unnecessary open ports on 104.28.1.189. Specifically, disable or restrict access to Ports 21 (FTP), 22 (SSH), 25 (SMTP), 110 (POP3), and 3389 (RDP). For essential services, implement strict firewall rules (IP whitelisting) or require VPN access.\",\n",
      "\"3. Enhance Email Security: Publish a DMARC record with an enforcing policy (e.g., 'p=quarantine' or 'p=reject') to prevent email impersonation. Consider hardening the SPF record to '-all' after verifying all legitimate sending sources.\",\n",
      "\"4. Develop and Implement Security Policies: Create and enforce an Employee Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) to define expected behaviors and security requirements for all employees.\",\n",
      "\"5. Conduct Security Awareness Training: Implement mandatory security awareness training for all new employees and annual refresher training for all staff. This should cover topics like phishing, social engineering, password hygiene, and data handling.\",\n",
      "\"6. Regular Vulnerability Scanning: Perform regular vulnerability scans and penetration tests on all internet-facing assets to identify and address weaknesses proactively.\",\n",
      "\"7. Secure Email Protocols: Ensure all email clients are configured to use secure protocols like IMAPS/POP3S/SMTPS (ports 993/995/465) instead of insecure POP3/SMTP (ports 110/25) for retrieving and sending mail.\"\n",
      "],\n",
      "\"Conclusion\": \"G.A.S. Inc. faces significant cybersecurity challenges due to widespread vulnerabilities in authentication, email protection, network perimeter, and security awareness. The current posture indicates a high level of risk to organizational assets and data. Immediate and comprehensive action on the recommendations is crucial to mitigate these risks and establish a more robust cybersecurity defense.\"\n",

    "#### Markdown/Markdown:\n",
    "- Pro Markdown Markdown: Sample 1 did not generate the cybersecurity team at the end. Headers were not easy to read as the font size was similar to the other paragraph text. Sample 2 had some text not indented into separate newlines.\n",
    "- Flash Markdown Markdown: Sample 1 had more text not properly moved into separate newlines. Headers were also not easy to read. Table text was center aligned and harder to read at a glance. Sample 2 had similar issues.\n",
    "- Flash Lite Markdown Markdown: Sample 1 had text not properly moved into separate newlines and bullet-pointed lists not rendering due to the newline issue. Though, the tables wer left-aligned and easier to understand than the Flash model's output. Sample 2 in particular had better results than the Flash and maybe even the Pro model.\n",
    "- Overall, did not perform as consistent as I would have liked. Markdown being used as both the input and output lead to inconsistencies in the styling.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Markdown/JSON:\n",
    "- Pro Markdown JSON: For the bare bone minimum text per header, JSON works quite effectively. The Pro model in particular was able to hit home all of the points. It would only lose points on styling, as with this method, the styling would be handed over to frontend rather than being handled by the backend (which, if communicated effectively, would not be an issue).\n",
    "- Flash Markdown JSON: Similar to the Pro model, the JSON output works effectively to generate only the headers of information we provide.\n",
    "- Flash Lite Markdown JSON: For some reason, Sample 1 was able to generate the emojis. However, it also generated some of the Markdown text which was not expected. Lost points on mixing up the output formatting.\n",
    "- Overall, performed as consistent as I expected- the Pro and Flash models in particular. If we choose to have the frontend capture most of the formatting of the PDF, then we will be able to use the JSON output.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### PDF/Markdown:\n",
    "- Pro PDF Markdown: Sample 1 was not able to move some of the text properly into separate newlines, leading to breaks in the bullet-pointed formatting. Similarly, Sample 2 had breaks in the numbered list for Recommendations. However, it was able to come up with creative emokis and formatted the tables in a way that was easy to understand at a glance.\n",
    "- Flash PDF Markdown: Sample 1 also had some breaks in the bullet-pointed format. Sample 2 however, had more tables and was easy-to-read at a glance. Both had emojis like the Pro model's output but limited to checks and x's.\n",
    "- Flash Lite PDF Markdown: Sample 1 did not have a proper header for the report and most of the paragraphs were not indented correctly into new, bullet-pointed lines. Sample 2 however, was able to generate successfully without any errors in the response. The only potential issue was lack of emoji's to simplify information and have it easier to see at a glance.\n",
    "- Overall, the PDF input was able to get more context to the model as compared to the Markdown/Markdown reports, but the Markdown output was still leading to inconsistencies in the styling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### PDF/JSON:\n",
    "- Pro PDF JSON: Best of the three models due to it's extensive information, even putting the potential risk for Sample 1. Sample 2 had capital letters with URGENT on the recommendations which was extremely helpful.\n",
    "- Flash PDF JSON: Included strange spacing in the beginning for a couple of the string values trying to mimic the bullet-pointed format. Not sure if we like those.\n",
    "- Flash Lite PDF JSON: Not the best but still performed well compared to other input/output tests.\n",
    "- Overall, the PDF input and JSON output performed the highest compared to all other report types. The PDF input provided enough context to the model and JSON has the most consistent output. Similar with the other JSON output, if we choose to have the JSON output we have to have frontend capture most if not all of the formatting for the PDF. We will go with the Flash as the free tier rate limits are much lower and easier to manage than the Pro."
