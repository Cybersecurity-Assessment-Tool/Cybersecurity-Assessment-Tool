<p>Cybersecurity Readiness Report for Apex Innovations
Date: October 14, 2025</p>
<p><strong>1. Overview</strong></p>
<p>This report provides an evaluation of the cybersecurity readiness of Apex Innovations, based on a combination of a self-reported security questionnaire and external technical scans, including DNS analysis and port scanning. The findings indicate a strong commitment to identity management, employee awareness, and email security. However, the network architecture, which exposes web services on the primary external IP address, presents a notable area for improvement and a potential risk to the organization.</p>
<p><strong>2. Organizational Information</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Organization Name:</strong> Apex Innovations</li>
<li><strong>Email Domain:</strong> apexinnovations.com</li>
<li><strong>Website Domain:</strong> www.apexinnovations.com</li>
<li><strong>External / Website IP:</strong> 72.21.196.160 (Note: The primary external IP and the web server IP are the same)</li>
</ul>

</table>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Apex Innovations reports a strong internal security culture. The mandatory use of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all key access points significantly reduces the risk of credential-based attacks. This is complemented by a solid foundation of employee policies and regular security awareness training.</p>
<p><strong>4. DNS &amp; Email Security</strong></p>
<p><strong>DNS Records</strong>
*   DNS is managed on self-hosted nameservers (<code>ns1.apexinnovations.com</code>, <code>ns2.apexinnovations.com</code>), indicating direct control over their DNS infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>MX Records (Email)</strong>
*   The organization uses Microsoft 365 for its email services, as indicated by the SPF record pointing to <code>spf.protection.outlook.com</code>.
*   The SPF record is correctly configured with a <code>-all</code> (hard fail) mechanism, which helps prevent unauthorized servers from sending email on behalf of their domain:
    <code>v=spf1 include:spf.protection.outlook.com -all</code></p>
<p><strong>DMARC Record</strong>
*   A strong DMARC policy is in place, instructing receiving mail servers to <strong>reject</strong> emails that fail authentication checks. This provides excellent protection against direct domain spoofing and phishing attacks.
    <code>v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:dmarc_reports@apexinnovations.com; fo=1</code></p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The organization's email security configuration is robust and adheres to modern best practices. The combination of SPF and a DMARC "reject" policy is a significant strength.</p>
<p><strong>5. Port Scanning Results</strong></p>
<p><strong>External Firewall / Website IP (72.21.196.160)</strong>
*   <strong>Port 80 (HTTP): Open</strong>
*   <strong>Port 443 (HTTPS): Open</strong></p>
<p>The port scan reveals that the primary external IP address for the organization is also hosting the public-facing website. While these ports are necessary for web traffic, exposing them directly on the main corporate firewall IP increases the network's attack surface. Any vulnerability in the web server, its applications, or its configuration could potentially provide a pivot point into the internal network.</p>

<p><strong>7. Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>While Apex Innovations has many strong security controls, the following recommendations are made to address the identified risks and further mature its cybersecurity posture:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Network Segmentation:</strong> The highest priority should be to isolate the web server from the internal corporate network. This can be achieved by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Placing the web server in a segregated network zone (a DMZ).</li>
<li>Migrating the website to a reputable third-party cloud hosting provider.
This will ensure that a compromise of the web server does not lead to an immediate compromise of internal systems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Web Application Security:</strong> Given its direct exposure, the web server requires heightened security. Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect against common web-based attacks and conduct regular vulnerability scans of the web application and server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Verify DKIM Implementation:</strong> While SPF and DMARC are in place, ensure that DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) is also configured for Microsoft 365 to complete the trifecta of email authentication standards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Develop an Incident Response Plan:</strong> Formalize, document, and test an incident response plan to ensure the organization can respond effectively and efficiently in the event of a security breach.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>8. Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Apex Innovations demonstrates a very strong cybersecurity foundation in terms of policy, user authentication, and email security. These proactive measures significantly reduce risk from phishing and credential theft. The primary area of concern is the network architecture, where the public-facing website is co-located with the main network perimeter. By implementing the recommendation to segment the web server, Apex Innovations can substantially reduce its attack surface and elevate its overall security posture from strong to excellent.</p>
