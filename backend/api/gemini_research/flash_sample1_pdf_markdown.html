<h2>Cybersecurity Readiness Report for Apex Innovations</h2>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> October 14, 2025</p>
<p><strong>1. Overview</strong>
This report assesses the cybersecurity posture of Apex Innovations based on information gathered from DNS records (DIG), port scans of the external IP and website, and responses to a security questionnaire. The findings indicate a robust commitment to essential cybersecurity practices, particularly in user access controls, email security, and staff awareness. The organization appears to directly host its website on its external-facing IP address.</p>
<p><strong>2. Organizational Information</strong>
*   <strong>Organization Name:</strong> Apex Innovations
*   <strong>Email Domain:</strong> apexinnovations.com
*   <strong>Website Domain:</strong> www.apexinnovations.com
*   <strong>External IP / Website IP:</strong> 72.21.196.160
*   <strong>DNS Hosting:</strong> Self-managed (ns1.apexinnovations.com, ns2.apexinnovations.com)</p>
<p><strong>3. Security Questionnaire Review</strong>
Apex Innovations reports a strong adherence to foundational cybersecurity policies and controls:</p>

</tr>
<tr>

<td style="text-align: left;">✅ Yes</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> The organization has fully implemented critical security measures concerning multi-factor authentication (MFA) across key access points, established an acceptable use policy, and conducts regular security awareness training for all employees. This demonstrates a proactive and policy-driven approach to reducing insider threats and unauthorized access.</p>
<p><strong>4. DNS &amp; Email Security</strong></p>
<p><strong>DNS Records</strong>
*   DNS is managed internally by Apex Innovations (ns1.apexinnovations.com, ns2.apexinnovations.com), suggesting direct control over DNS infrastructure.
*   The primary A record for apexinnovations.com points to 72.21.196.160, indicating the main website and external services are hosted on this IP.</p>
<p><strong>MX Records (Email)</strong>
*   Email is configured to use internal mail exchange servers (mx1.apexinnovations.com, mx2.apexinnovations.com).
*   <strong>SPF Record:</strong> <code>v=spf1 include:spf.protection.outlook.com -all</code>
    *   The SPF record is correctly configured, including Microsoft Outlook's SPF for legitimate email sending. The <code>-all</code> mechanism specifies a "hard fail" policy, instructing receiving mail servers to reject mail from unauthorized senders, providing strong protection against email spoofing.</p>
<p><strong>DMARC Record</strong>
*   <strong>DMARC Record:</strong> <code>v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:dmarc_reports@apexinnovations.com; fo=1</code>
    *   A valid DMARC record is present with a <code>p=reject</code> policy. This is the strongest DMARC policy, directing receiving servers to reject emails that fail DMARC authentication. This significantly mitigates risks from phishing and impersonation attacks. Email reports are configured to be sent to <code>dmarc_reports@apexinnovations.com</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> DNS and email security configurations (SPF with hard fail and DMARC with a reject policy) are exceptionally strong and follow best practices, significantly reducing the risk of email-based attacks like spoofing and phishing.</p>
<p><strong>5. Port Scanning Results</strong></p>
<p><strong>Website &amp; External IP (72.21.196.160)</strong>
*   <strong>Port 80 (HTTP):</strong> Open
*   <strong>Port 443 (HTTPS):</strong> Open</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Both the "Website Scan" and "External IP Scan" targeted the same IP address (72.21.196.160), indicating that the organization's public website is hosted directly on its external IP, likely behind a firewall that only permits HTTP and HTTPS traffic. The open ports 80 and 443 are standard and expected for a publicly accessible web server. No other ports were found open, which is positive for minimizing the attack surface.</p>

<th style="text-align: left;">Status</th>
<th style="text-align: left;">Notes</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Authentication Security</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">✅ Strong</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">MFA is a mandatory requirement across email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems, providing robust protection against credential theft.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Email Security</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">✅ Strong</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Comprehensive SPF (<code>-all</code>) and DMARC (<code>p=reject</code>) policies are in place, significantly reducing the threat of email spoofing and phishing, and directing unauthenticated emails to be rejected. Reporting is also configured.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Network Exposure</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">✅ Secure</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The external IP (72.21.196.160) only exposes necessary web ports (80, 443). This indicates a well-configured perimeter firewall minimizing the external attack surface.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Web Hosting</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">✅ Good</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">The website is hosted on the external IP, with only standard web ports open. While this consolidates the external presence, it means the web server is directly exposed and requires vigilant patching and security monitoring.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Policy &amp; Training</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">✅ Comprehensive</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">An acceptable use policy is established, and security awareness training is conducted for both new hires and annually for all employees, fostering a security-conscious culture.</td>
</tr>

<p><strong>7. Recommendations</strong>
Apex Innovations exhibits a commendable cybersecurity readiness posture. To further enhance and maintain this strong position, the following recommendations are suggested:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Implement DKIM:</strong> While SPF and DMARC are robust, ensure DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) is also properly configured for all outgoing email to provide an additional layer of email authentication and trust.</li>
<li><strong>Regular Vulnerability Management:</strong> Given the direct exposure of the web server on the external IP, implement regular external and internal vulnerability scanning of this server and underlying infrastructure. Establish a rigorous patch management program for all software, operating systems, and web applications running on this server.</li>
<li><strong>Incident Response Plan:</strong> Develop, document, and regularly test a comprehensive cybersecurity incident response and disaster recovery plan. This ensures the organization can effectively detect, respond to, and recover from security incidents.</li>
<li><strong>Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):</strong> Consider implementing a SIEM solution to centralize log collection, monitor security events in real-time, and facilitate threat detection and analysis, particularly for the externally exposed web server.</li>
<li><strong>Web Application Firewall (WAF):</strong> To protect the public-facing website more effectively, consider deploying a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to defend against common web-based attacks (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>8. Conclusion</strong>
Apex Innovations has established a strong cybersecurity foundation, particularly in user authentication, email protection, network perimeter security, and employee security awareness. The organization's proactive measures significantly reduce its overall cyber risk. By adopting the recommended continuous improvement strategies, Apex Innovations can further strengthen its defenses and ensure long-term resilience against evolving cyber threats.</p>
