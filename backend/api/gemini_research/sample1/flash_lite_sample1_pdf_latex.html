<h1>Cybersecurity Readiness Report for Apex Innovations</h1>
<h2>Date: October 14, 2025</h2>
<hr />
<h2>1. Overview</h2>
<p>This report evaluates the cybersecurity readiness of Apex Innovations based on provided technical scan data (DNS, port scanning) and answers to a security questionnaire. The assessment indicates a generally strong security posture with robust practices in place for authentication and email security, alongside necessary website accessibility.</p>
<hr />
<h2>2. Organizational Information</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Organization Name:</strong> Apex Innovations</li>
<li><strong>Email Domain:</strong> apexinnovations.com</li>
<li><strong>Website Domain:</strong> www.apexinnovations.com</li>

</table>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Apex Innovations demonstrates a commendable commitment to fundamental cybersecurity practices. The mandatory use of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across email, computer logins, and sensitive data systems is a significant strength. The presence of an acceptable use policy and regular security awareness training for all employees, including new hires, indicates a proactive approach to user-related security risks.</p>
<hr />
<h2>4. DNS &amp; Email Security</h2>
<p><strong>DNS Records for <code>apexinnovations.com</code>:</strong>
*   The domain's A record points to <code>72.21.196.160</code>, which is also identified as the external IP and the web server.
*   MX records point to <code>mx1.apexinnovations.com</code> and <code>mx2.apexinnovations.com</code>, indicating that Apex Innovations manages its own mail servers or a dedicated mail relay service.
*   The TXT record reveals an SPF configuration: <code>v=spf1 include:spf.protection.outlook.com -all</code>. This suggests that Apex Innovations utilizes Microsoft 365 for its email services, and the SPF record is correctly configured to authorize Microsoft's servers for sending email on behalf of the domain.</p>
<p><strong>DMARC Record for <code>_dmarc.apexinnovations.com</code>:</strong>
*   A DMARC record is present: <code>v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:dmarc_reports@apexinnovations.com; fo=1</code>.
*   The <code>p=reject</code> policy is a strong measure against email spoofing and phishing attempts, instructing receiving mail servers to reject emails that fail DMARC checks.
*   The <code>rua</code> tag indicates that DMARC aggregate reports are being sent to <code>dmarc_reports@apexinnovations.com</code>, which is crucial for monitoring and refining email authentication.
*   The <code>fo=1</code> flag indicates that reporting should occur if any alignment check fails, providing detailed feedback.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Apex Innovations has implemented strong email security measures with a properly configured SPF record pointing to Microsoft 365 and a robust DMARC policy set to <code>reject</code>. This significantly mitigates the risk of email-based attacks like phishing and spoofing.</p>
<hr />
<h2>5. Port Scanning Results</h2>
<p><strong>External IP (<code>72.21.196.160</code>) / Firewall:</strong>
*   Port 80 (HTTP) is open.
*   Port 443 (HTTPS) is open.
*   <strong>Observation:</strong> The external IP address, which is also associated with the website, reveals only standard web ports (HTTP and HTTPS) as open. This is expected for a publicly accessible website and suggests that the firewall is configured to allow only necessary traffic for web services. No other unnecessary ports appear to be exposed externally.</p>
<p><strong>Website (<code>www.apexinnovations.com</code>):</strong>
*   Port 80 is open.
*   Port 443 is open.
*   <strong>Observation:</strong> Consistent with the external IP scan, the website is accessible via HTTP and HTTPS, which are the standard protocols for web browsing.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The external network perimeter appears to be well-secured, with only essential ports for web services exposed. This minimizes the attack surface available to external threats.</p>

<h2>7. Recommendations</h2>
<p>While Apex Innovations exhibits a strong cybersecurity posture, continuous improvement is key. The following recommendations can further enhance their readiness:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>DKIM Implementation:</strong> Ensure that DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) is also configured and active for <code>apexinnovations.com</code>. While SPF and DMARC are in place, DKIM adds another layer of email authentication, further strengthening email security and preventing spoofing.</li>
<li><strong>Regular Vulnerability Scanning:</strong> Implement a schedule for regular internal and external vulnerability scans of the external IP address and any other exposed infrastructure. This helps identify and remediate potential weaknesses proactively.</li>
<li><strong>Incident Response Plan:</strong> Develop and document a comprehensive incident response plan. Regularly conduct tabletop exercises or simulations to test the plan's effectiveness and ensure staff are prepared to handle security incidents.</li>
<li><strong>Security Patch Management:</strong> Maintain a robust patch management process for all systems, including servers hosting the website and any internal systems that might be indirectly exposed. Prompt patching of vulnerabilities is critical.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2>8. Conclusion</h2>
<p>Apex Innovations demonstrates a high level of cybersecurity readiness. The organization has successfully implemented critical security controls, including mandatory MFA, robust email authentication mechanisms (SPF and DMARC with a reject policy), and a clear security awareness program. The limited exposure of network services on the external perimeter further contributes to a strong security posture. By continuing to monitor security best practices and addressing the recommendations outlined above, Apex Innovations can maintain and enhance its cybersecurity resilience.</p>
